Now if you will come down from the clouds for a moment and explain how none of the other countries (Great Britain, Israel, The Netherlands, etc.) that allow gays to serve openly have not experienced any significant disruption of service and order or caused morale problems, then you may have something creditable to discuss. Until you can do that then you only have your personal opinion to speak on and that does not reflect the facts. Or perhaps you do not have the faith and confidence in our military to do as good a job in handling this issue as a dozen other countries have done.

You're a newbie here, though, and we don't know you well enough to even know if you're being honest about all your years of service or anything else. What it SEEMS is that you've showed up just to make one nasty, hateful post and leave. We call that sort of thing TROLLING.

In fact, the most times I've seen/heard of a disruptive incident involving a gay or suspected gay service member, the incident is usually CAUSED by a straight homophobic person attacking or harassing the gay person. From what I can tell, we should weed out the people who actually CAUSE the problems, and make sure that homophobes don't enlist.",
