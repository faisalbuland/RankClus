What ever the real reasons are that we still have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan the reasons that we are there clearly have nothing to do with protecting the freedoms or lives of Americans. Is that not what a military is supposed to do? Of course the leaders of the militaryindustrialcomplex can say that we are looking for Obama. hahahaha. I guess that shows that nothing important is taught in US schools anymore, military or civilian schools. If anything was taught then even those in the military would understand that leadership of the U.S. militaryindustrialcomplex is far more dangerous and criminal that even Osama. The United States is not a country it is a continuing criminal enterprise with its own continent.",
