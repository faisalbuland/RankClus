Those joining the U.S. army as career soldiers are the ones who fled PKK camps inside northern Iraq, the report said. The Ex-PKK members recruited by the U.S. office in the northern Iraqi province of Arbil are briefly trained in Baghdad and given new identities before being sent to fight against Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan, according to the report. The issue was also included in the intelligence reports of Turkey's National Intelligence Organization (MIT), police and gendarmerie forces, it added. Kanal D also had a Syrian-origin PKK member confirm the report. The PKK member said at least 15 of his friends have joined the U.S. army. U.S. officials promised green cards to PKK members in return for their service, the report also said. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Ankara and much of the international community, including the EU and the United States. Turkey has been carrying out military operations against the terror organization PKK both inside Turkey and in northern Iraq. \"http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/world/11184415.asp?scr=1\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
