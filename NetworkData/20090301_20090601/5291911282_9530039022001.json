Yes, but by the time war was declared the British had stopped that practice.[/QUOTE] I notice that Americans can be a bit cagey about what sort of trade many those US ships were engaged in. (That said the whole issue about Britain's unilateral enforcement of the 1808 Slave Trade ban has always reminded me of the zealous convert trying to assuage his guilt.) I certainly have the feeling that until 1808 many of those American Citizens and American Ships flew the Union Jack and hurriedly changed allegiance somewhere between Bristol and West Africa. As to whether he could claim British citizenship that's probably a bit murky, there were a couple of Acts that restricted the rights of Colonial and Commonwealth citizens to claim full British citizenship back in the Eighties (Thatcher was worried about several million Hong Kong Chinese suddenly rocking up before the 1997 handover). As I recall the right to say civis Britannicus sum was restricted to those who actually had ancestors from the UK and there were secondary tests even for them. Anyway even if he is we don't want him - or the rest of you for that matter - you're more trouble than you're worth.",

        "reply": " Yes, but by the time war was declared the British had stopped that practice.[/QUOTE] I notice that Americans can be a bit cagey about what sort of trade many those US ships were engaged in. (That said the whole issue about Britain's unilateral enforcement of the 1808 Slave Trade ban has always reminded me of the zealous convert trying to assuage his guilt.) I certainly have the feeling that until 1808 many of those American Citizens and American Ships flew the Union Jack and hurriedly changed allegiance somewhere between Bristol and West Africa. As to whether he could claim British citizenship that's probably a bit murky, there were a couple of Acts that restricted the rights of Colonial and Commonwealth citizens to claim full British citizenship back in the Eighties (Thatcher was worried about several million Hong Kong Chinese suddenly rocking up before the 1997 handover). As I recall the right to say civis Britannicus sum was restricted to those who actually had ancestors from the UK and there were secondary tests even for them. Anyway even if he is we don't want him - or the rest of you for that matter - you're more trouble than you're worth.",
