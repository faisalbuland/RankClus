There is a new album coming out called American Soldier that was written for the American Soldier, Families and about the life and issues soldiers have faced with their stories and voices on the album. Please see and read this URL as I hope many of you would call in and share your stories..and hear the new single, \"If I were king\" NO,NOPE,NOT GONNA HAPPEN Heres more on the album.. \"We began the project that would become American Soldier right after Mindcrime II was released,\" says Queensr\u00ffche frontman and visionary Geoff Tate of his band\u2019s ambitious new release, their fourth for Rhino. \"The process started with a conversation with my dad. He was a career military man, with the Marines in Korea and an Air Force tour of duty in Vietnam in \u201968. He was with the Air Force my entire life\u2013I was born on a base in Germany\u2013and when he retired he ended up taking a job with the Navy. He had never talked about his experiences in war, and all my life I\u2019ve been asking questions and waiting for the stories that I never heard. These past couple of years he started talking, and I taped one of the conversations. That was the beginning\u2026\" American Soldier is more than a concept album; it is a statement of mission, a revelation of purpose, and a march for understanding. One thing that it is not is political. \"People have a tendency to misconstrue the difference between political and social issues. This record is not political at all,\" affirms Tate. \"It\u2019s very much a statement of the soldiers; it\u2019s where they are at and what they have experienced. I hope the album, as a whole, is a statement that can get them talking to each other and begin that process of connecting that needs to happen between people.\" To make that statement, Tate interviewed dozens of enlistees and veterans, the oldest having served in World War II and the youngest still in active duty in Iraq, with every American war in between represented. For an artist accustomed to writing from personal experiences, the lyrical process for American Soldier proved an invigorating challenge. \"This was one of the more challenging records for me to write, lyrically, because I am not involved in the songs. It is not about me, and it\u2019s not about how I feel. It is me interpreting stories from the perspectives of the soldiers and putting their words into lyric form, retelling the story in the most honest way that I could. If you or a loved one would like to share their story.. please call Are you a soldier? Do you have a story you want to share..?
