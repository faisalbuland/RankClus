He is declaring war on investors, entrepreneurs, small businesses, large corporations, and private-equity and venture-capital funds. We told you so? Color added by me. You believe this stuff right? Wow! So, you believe that President Obama went to Washington, went through all he did, risked his life (how many whackos out there do you think have dreamed of picking him off) so he could go to Washington and destroy the American economy right? Please, arguments should at least pass the common sense test before you embrace them as your own. He is picking up the pieces of a shattered economy left to him by the \"raping and pillaging\" of America by the recent administration. They worked over America like a swarm of locusts in a field. Now, the question is what do you do? Well, you have to get the economy moving and the private sector will not do that right now. The private sector (both the consumer and the companies) have retrenched and are in a spiral downward. Have you heard of the economic theory called \"The paradox of thrift\"? It essentially says that as a policy you want people to save and be thrifty. However, if EVERYONE saves and is thrifty, the economy goes into a depression. That is what we are experiencing here. In September, the banking system came within hours of a complete collapse. Since then, I believe it has barely been on life support. Citi is essentially bankrupt and been taken over by the Government. When the banks are in shambles then the mechanism by which money flows from the Fed to the public is broken. Think of it as a giant pipeline with a huge gash in it. You better think hard on this. The economy is dead and the only one who can save it whether your ideology likes it or not is the Government. Wait until the next shoe: Public Pensions are essentially bankrupt (yes, that means federal a.k.a. military), state and local. All those people who thought they were going to get a pension.. poof.. up in smoke in the last 8 years.",

When you look at what he was replying to, the smiley face he used, the manner in which he worded it, and his history of absolute HATRED of anything on the right side of the scale... well, the jury doesn't need to deliberate for long. If you choose to ignore certain facts to concentrate on others, then that is your choice and you don't have context. All things considered, his intent is crystal clear. quote: Originally posted by karlhungusjr:Are you talking about the British political party? Those Americans who remained loyal to the king? What historical incident are you referring to where \"veterans killed veterans\"? Huh? No. I wasn't waxing historical at all. I'll go back and re-read, but I don't recall using anything like \"again\" or \"history\" or anything else relating to the military v. the military. The history I addressed was his, Scott's, posting history to validate his poisonous detest for those that do not agree with his political views. Unless he was a member of the British Political Party, I wasn't in any way attempting to suggest that America has a past of veterans against veterans. quote: tonies (God I had talking like a freaking third grader - doesn't the Navy teach you all anything about the dignity found in adult expression?) quote: Originally posted by karlhungusjr: And I have no idea what you mean by this. Sure you do, though I erred when I said \"you all.\" For that I do apologize. It just bugs the ever living crap out me when people act like children and call names like 5th graders in the school sandbox. Dumorat! Tonies! Neocon! Osama! McSame! And on... and on... and on... and on... I envision a civilian reading this crap and thinking, Wow, I guess the rumors are true and people in the military really ARE too stupid to do anything else. Bunch of f-ing baby killing robot morons... A pet peeve, if you will. The ability to articulate isn't hard. I never graduated 7th grade, and I can talk in text just fine. If I can do it, anyone can do it, because I am one dumb SOB. It is pure childishness that someone would use \"DemoRat.\" It just tells me that they have nothing substantial to add and are in the thread to incite slapping contests, rather than working through issues. And while we can't change the world by typing here, we can at LEAST hear each other out and try and work together for our country and our dedication to service of the nation. I see nothing even remotely similar to that in name calling or in any single Scottrj50 post. Nothing. He is here only to gloat in Mr. Obama's win and stir the pot. And I find that contemptible. You are, of course, both welcome to and encouraged to disagree. I can't learn from people that \"mmm hmmm\" me to death. I learn from people who disagree with me and present a rational argument, just as WP swayed my stance on universal health care and (GULP!) took this conservative and made me a supporter. Kind of like you learn to aim by smacking your thumb with a hammer, LOL! Have a great morning, bro, and stay safe! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening.

When you look at what he was replying to, the smiley face he used, the manner in which he worded it, and his history of absolute HATRED of anything on the right side of the scale... well, the jury doesn't need to deliberate for long. If you choose to ignore certain facts to concentrate on others, then that is your choice and you don't have context. All things considered, his intent is crystal clear. quote: Originally posted by karlhungusjr:Are you talking about the British political party? Those Americans who remained loyal to the king? What historical incident are you referring to where \"veterans killed veterans\"? Huh? No. I wasn't waxing historical at all. I'll go back and re-read, but I don't recall using anything like \"again\" or \"history\" or anything else relating to the military v. the military. The history I addressed was his, Scott's, posting history to validate his poisonous detest for those that do not agree with his political views. Unless he was a member of the British Political Party, I wasn't in any way attempting to suggest that America has a past of veterans against veterans. quote: tonies (God I had talking like a freaking third grader - doesn't the Navy teach you all anything about the dignity found in adult expression?) quote: Originally posted by karlhungusjr: And I have no idea what you mean by this. Sure you do, though I erred when I said \"you all.\" For that I do apologize. It just bugs the ever living crap out me when people act like children and call names like 5th graders in the school sandbox. Dumorat! Tonies! Neocon! Osama! McSame! And on... and on... and on... and on... I envision a civilian reading this crap and thinking, Wow, I guess the rumors are true and people in the military really ARE too stupid to do anything else. Bunch of f-ing baby killing robot morons... A pet peeve, if you will. The ability to articulate isn't hard. I never graduated 7th grade, and I can talk in text just fine. If I can do it, anyone can do it, because I am one dumb SOB. It is pure childishness that someone would use \"DemoRat.\" It just tells me that they have nothing substantial to add and are in the thread to incite slapping contests, rather than working through issues. And while we can't change the world by typing here, we can at LEAST hear each other out and try and work together for our country and our dedication to service of the nation. I see nothing even remotely similar to that in name calling or in any single Scottrj50 post. Nothing. He is here only to gloat in Mr. Obama's win and stir the pot. And I find that contemptible. You are, of course, both welcome to and encouraged to disagree. I can't learn from people that \"mmm hmmm\" me to death. I learn from people who disagree with me and present a rational argument, just as WP swayed my stance on universal health care and (GULP!) took this conservative and made me a supporter. Kind of like you learn to aim by smacking your thumb with a hammer, LOL! Have a great morning, bro, and stay safe! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

Wow! So, you believe that President Obama went to Washington, went through all he did, risked his life (how many whackos out there do you think have dreamed of picking him off) so he could go to Washington and destroy the American economy right?

Now, the question is what do you do? Well, you have to get the economy moving and the private sector will not do that right now. The private sector (both the consumer and the companies) have retrenched and are in a spiral downward. Have you heard of the economic theory called \"The paradox of thrift\"? It essentially says that as a policy you want people to save and be thrifty. However, if EVERYONE saves and is thrifty, the economy goes into a depression. That is what we are experiencing here. In September, the banking system came within hours of a complete collapse. Since then, I believe it has barely been on life support. Citi is essentially bankrupt and been taken over by the Government. When the banks are in shambles then the mechanism by which money flows from the Fed to the public is broken. Think of it as a giant pipeline with a huge gash in it. You better think hard on this. The economy is dead and the only one who can save it whether your ideology likes it or not is the Government.

And what I stated was in context. You failed to follow it, but that is neither my problem or my responsibility to educate you on. As I said, you're welcome to complete your own research. If you choose not to or you derive a different conclusion, then that's fine, too. Your replies are usually acidic in nature, so I suspect that my political leanings will equate me in your eyes with some perpetual wrong. Regardless, I usually enjoy a bit of bitter discourse - get the blood pumping, fire a little here, fire a little back over there. But ANY avocation, no matter how \"cleverly\" disguised ( ) , of ANY violence against veterans, especially by other veterans, is NOT the military I served in. It's only keeping us all separated and the politicians in complete control, where the (R) and (D) monikers mean nothing in the scope of money and power. But FAR more disturbing than that is the mere suggestion that one veteran uses a smiley face after suggesting that vets are coming for vets - tonies (God I had talking like a freaking third grader - doesn't the Navy teach you all anything about the dignity found in adult expression?) are veterans, too. It's not hard when you take off the partisan glasses. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
