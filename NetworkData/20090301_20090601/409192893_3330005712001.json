By Jared Allen Posted: 03/10/09 12:55 PM [ET] House Democrats are looking at yet another economic stimulus bill beyond the $787 billion one just enacted as investors and consumers continue to show little faith in the economy. At a special meeting of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on Tuesday morning, Democrats heard again from their trusted band of economists and came away reinforced that Congress would need to spend billions of additional taxpayer dollars in the coming months to help pull the economy out its severe recession. One proposal being considered is an additional economic stimulus bill. Just last month, President Obama signed a $787 billion stimulus measure that Democrats contended was needed to save or create 3.5 million jobs and that Republicans derided as nothing more than debt-spending on wasteful federal projects. \u201cWe are going to need more taxpayer money,\u201d Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Economy.com and a key economic adviser to congressional Democrats, said after the meeting. \u201cI think another stimulus package is a reasonable assumption because of the way things are going.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), standing with members of her leadership team by Zandi\u2019s side, said she agreed that another stimulus bill is being considered. \u201cWe have to keep the door open,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe word of the day is confidence. Confidence in our markets, confidence in lending, confidence in our financial institutions.\u201d Democrats leaned on the same group of economists they heard from before \u2014 including Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc.; Rebecca M. Blank, Robert S. Kerr senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; and Alan Blinder of Princeton University \u2014 to craft a stimulus bill that was $819 billion when it came out of the House before it was scaled back by Senate and House negotiators. Barely a month old, the spending provisions in the massive stimulus bill are just beginning to take effect. And while Democrats and their economic advisers said it was the right prescription for the economy \u2014 and that it should be given time to work \u2014 they also said that more will be needed. \u201cThe bad news is it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d Blank said. \u201cThe good news is there are a whole series of actions being taken [including the stimulus].\u201d \u201cWhether this is enough, I think, is still unknown,\u201d she added. \u201cThe risks are all on the side of under-reaching, not overreaching.\u201d The economists and lawmakers made it clear that part of their immediate goal is to inject confidence into the economy \u2014 by reaching the psyches of investors and consumers \u2014 through words alone. Actions will come quickly, they said, to supplement the confidence they hope to pass on right away. \u201cWhat characterizes the current environment is a loss of faith,\u201d Zandi said, noting that faith is part of what separates a recession from a depression. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t convinced yet that this is going to work.\u201d \u201cWe have to pay due diligence to what is next for us to do to make sure that we continue to make an advance on turning around this economic downturn,\u201d Steering and Policy Co-Chairman George Miller (D-Calif.) said. \u201cDelaying doing what is necessary is not an option we can afford.\u201d \u201cThe policy directions that we have been undertaking along with the Obama administration are the right course,\u201d Miller\u2019s co-chairwoman, Rep.

They are the same dumb asses that got us here in the first place and still refuse to get it. How is that? I thought that this whole mess was started by the housing bubble (which was created by just about every politician in Congress since Clinton and idiot consumers who never want to live within their means). Then, all of the mortgages were sold to whatever financial house would buy them. Then, they packaged these mortgages into securities and sold those on the open market. After seeing that they could sell off the risk to somebody else, the information thereof rolled back downhill to the mortgage brokers and small banks who figured out they could just start giving even crappier mortgages because they could just shell the risk to somebody else. \"Just get it signed and get that piece of toilet paper outta here\", they said. Then, after seeing how the mortgage brokers were now selling crappy mortgages up the chain, the big wigs on wall street figured they better do something to make these crappy mortgage backed securities look better. So, they in turn bundled them together with good mortgage backed securities into what is now called Collateralized Debt Obligations and sold those on the market. Then, on the other side of the coin, the buyers said, \"Whoa, these CDOs look too good to be true with their 20% gains and what not. I better insure these investments\". So, the bought Credit Default Swaps from AIG and other insurers to insure not only their CDOs, but their Mortgage Backed Securities, as well. Then, along comes a little whisper from the shadows that says \"hey, I heard Bear Sterns is cooking the books\". I heard it, my cousin heard it, my friends heard it, every investor heard it. And, next thing you know, Bear is the focus of every late night news and business show being asked why they are insolvent (even though, they weren't....Yet). Then, the when crap starts to hit the fan on Bears stock prices as everybody is yelling sell, sell, sell the Fed comes in and says \"Hey, JPM! We'll give you a non-recourse loan of $29 billion if you buy Bear for $1.2 billion, whataya think\"? JPM say \"heck Yes!! Whoohoo!!! I'm rich, Bicht!\" Meanwhile, the can of worms has been opened. The Fed and Treasury finally say that they are going to look into the eye of moral hazard and let Lehman fall to show that they have cajones. Only, it isn't until after they look at the books that they realize how intertwined Lehman was with just about every investment firm and bank on the planet. Next thing you know, the whole thing has broke loose. There is no stopping it. When, in all of this did Congress have a say, or even know what in the hell was going on, before and during the unfolding of this? Sure, the Republicans did it. No, the banks and investment firms did this. Everybody kept shelling risk to save their behind. Never realizing the web that they were spinning. And, quite a web it is. Ever heard of that 'ol 'six degrees of seperation'? Well, there is maybe 2-3 degrees of seperation between just about every major bank and investment firm on the planet in this case. This was all done outside of government. And, one might ask, \"why didn't the government do something?\" Because they had and still have absolutely no idea how this stuff works. Even Allen Greenspan has said he doesn't understand how a CDO works. The guys that were selling these investments don't even know. And, no matter what regulation or law you write, the private sector is always ahead of Congress. Even if Congress (which was Controlled by the Democrats, by the way) had any idea of the scope of this problem, they wouldn't have been able to get legislation drafted, get it through Committee, get it out on the floor of the House, get it out on the floor of the Senate, get it passed in both, and then get it bottom lined by El Presidente. It just doesn't work like that. One would say that we need more regulation. Bullcrap! We are already heavily regulated. Plus, there are countless countries that have even heavier regulation than ours. But, notice that those other countries are in the same boat. And, as is known, the private sector is always ahead of the game. That is capitalism at it's finest. The main problem is that the banks are so interconnected to our economy. Our money is created when somebody borrows. Our money is backed by the debt that we create through the issuing of credit from the banks. As a matter of fact, if everybody in the world were to pay off all of their debt, there would be no money. It is true. So, it goes without saying that it is the FIAT system that is the problem. And, Congress is doing the worst possible thing imaginable. They are increasing the money supply through legislation to insane levels in an attempt to fill the void that public debt obligations left. You see, normally when somebody loses money, somebody else makes money. But, in this case, the money just vanished into thin air. That is only possible in a FIAT money system. And, Congress and the Fed are chasing that void thinking they are going to catch up with it. They may... But, we are going to be bankrupt and owned by the private banks. Another option is to let them all fail. I personally believe this is going to happen anyway. We are chasing something that we do not have the resources to catch. We might, but I doubt it. But, if we do let them fail our entire financial and money system will collapse. The Fed will be gone, the dollar will cease to have value. We will pretty much have to start from scratch. It isn't a pretty thought, but after taking into consideration the alternative, it may be our best bet. It would be nice to not have inflation anymore. It would be nice to do away with the discount window. I would like interest rates to be determine by the market for once. But, we will more than likely fight this to the end and be indebted to our creditors for the unforeseen future. The last option, of which has been only talked about recently in the mainstream (but, has been a conspiracy theory for quite some time) is that all of the Central Banks come together to form a single regulatory and monetary entity. This will probably fix the problem. But, I think most of us are aware of the implications of this. Basically, say goodbye to sovereignty. Say goodbye to the 'American Dream'. Plus, we will still be under a FIAT system. So, the problems of that system will present themselves again as they have in every usage since the Roman Empire. So, before you go pointing fingers, it would be prudent to know what you are talking about in the first place. Carry on. This message has been edited.

The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that, my dear friend, is about the end of any nation. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.",
