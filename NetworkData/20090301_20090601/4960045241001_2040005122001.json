One was in broad daylight more than 30 years ago and I STILL don't know what it was. I drove a big truck all my adult life and, one morning, another truck and I were headed into Greenville, MS, coming out of Arkansas. As we traveled across the floodplain just east of the bridge, by friend came on the CB and asked, \"What's that?\" and directed my attention to something hanging in mid-air over near the smokestack of a power plant alongside the river, north of the bridge. I didn't know and we speculated for a few moments that it might be something suspended in mid-air to measure pollution from the smokestack, or something like that. It looked, to me, very much like Snoopy's dog food bowl, but there was a long, narrow shaft protruding from the bottom with a small ball at the very end. As we traveled along Hwy 82, we could eventually see that it wasn't near the power plant at all; it was hanging in mid-air across the river, over Arkansas. Suddenly, with no warning or prior movement, it accelerated from a dead stop to completely out of sight westward in just over a second or so! It achieved the most mind-boggling speed I could imagine immediately! I grabbed the radio and said something like this: \"Don! Did you see that? What the hell?\" He responded thusly: \"I didn't see anything.\" And he's sticking to that story even today! Y'all tell me. What was it?",
