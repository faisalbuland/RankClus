The ONLY effective way to end the illegal worker problem is go after the COMPANIES and MANAGERS that hire the illegals or look the other way when others in the company hire the illegals. They also need to especially go after companies that RECRUIT illegals and that help illegals get \"documentation\" that makes them look like they are legal workers. Once compnaies are paying fines big enough to affect profits and a few CEOs and other top managers spend some time in jail and pay big fines companies will find cheap legal ways to determine who is a legal worker rather than find excuses to not check.",
