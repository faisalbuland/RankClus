I used a local bank in Iowa where I enlisted from, an account that I opened for a summer job when I was about 17, and their debit/MasterCard has served me well for the last ten years. It's worked everywhere from Slovenia to Kuwait to Argentina to Nepal, and they don't even charge me for overseas withdrawals, although I think that may be because they don't GET very many. The advantage to a smaller local bank is that when you call them to deal with an issue, you will get a human being pretty quickly. The DISadvantage is that they likely don't have anyone to answer the phone after banking hours, which is inconvenient when you are deployed overseas. Ask if the bank has online banking/billing, that is very useful for a servicemember.",
