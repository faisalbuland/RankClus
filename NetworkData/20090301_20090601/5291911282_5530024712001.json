He is locked in to work with pay even though he may not have to go to work. He makes more than $100.000 an year($29.81/hr. with benefits) Thats more than $40,000 a year more than an E-8 with 20 years in our military. He will retire making more than $3,000 a month. Again more than an E-8 with 20 years in. Not bad for someone with a high school education that works on an assembly line with only about 3 weeks of training. Now can you really feel sorry for him or GM?",

It is a truck, not a luxury car. Being they don't offer what I want, I will stick to the one I have. I like your thinking. People that want work trucks should not have to buy one with a bunch of crap they don't want. Over the years a large proportion of truck sales have changed from work vehicles to pleasure vehicles. I don't own a truck and don't want one. The two or three times a year I need a truck I just rent one but it seems like people want trucks regardless if they ever haul stuff in them or not. Looking at it from another angle it must be realized that dealers make a very big profit on accessories. It's to their advantage to stock product that's \"loaded.\" A friend of mine recently bought a new Honda Civic. The dealer tried to charge him $295.00 for floor mats, a trunk liner and four wheel locks! My friend asked the salesman if he had the word stupid tattooed on his forehead. The salesman took the $295.00 charge off the contract and didn't even bother having the stuff taken off the car. Just as an aside,the Honda Civic is a fine, well built car that has about the best trade in value there is but I've been in tanks that rode better. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",

The same executives get multi-million dollar golden parachutes when they leave the companies. They join another company and are paid millions by the company who just hired them. So they have a multi-million dollar golden parachute from one company and a multi-million dollar income from the company they now are with. Whats wrong with this picture? Corperate greed comes to mind. American car manufacturers cut corners to keep costs down so they can keep profits up while quality goes down!
