What a bunch of idiots!! Nice! Do you still have it???? Well, I do not think it would be legal to sell the exact car right now. Considering all the safety items designed into vehicles, more items standard (AC, pwr windows, pwr disc brakes, cloth seats, AM/FM/CD, tires, etc.) and overhead the car companies have, no way they could sell the car nowadays for $2,000. Adjusting just for inflation, it would have to sell for over $12,700. Add the overhead and so forth and a new 2010 V6 Mustang sells for around $21,000. Even at that price they are selling a lot of them. Does semm a little pricey, though.",
