You might also try the MODF section, but be aware that some of the posters there are not \"housebroken\". It has been many moons since I was in the Corps, but I would imagine that they ( USMC Commo school ) will work with your son and if he has problems with the course, then they might have him re-test. Remember ... They want him (and all others) to complete the course so that he becomes an asset to the USMC. In my experience ... If a guy can complete Boot Camp then MOS school is usually something that can be done. Not easy, but he can \"Hack it\"!",

I don't know if he was failing or just obviously miserable but he said a Sgt of some rank asked him what MOS he would like to change to. He asked for Infantry but they gave him Amphibious Assault Vehicle Mechanic School out at Camp Pendleton. He never gave AAV's much consideration but once he got into that school, he loved it. Now he's an E-4/Corporal hoping to make E-5/Sgt this summer. Pretty good for a 21 yr old. Best of luck to your son and to you as well. It ain't easy being a father to a military person as the concerns pile up....along with the pride. Don Proud father of a U.S. Marine",
