The conference, scheduled to air at 8 p.m. ET, will not just be held during prime time, but during the important sweeps period, costing the networks each millions of dollars in ad revenue. One source said Fox would lose $2 million to $3 million by airing the news conference instead of its regular programming. In 2000 Fox did not air a presidential debate and in 2001 it declined a request for airtime by President George W. Bush. ***So Libs can't say it was because it was Obama. They did it to Bush as well.*** Twice this year Fox has rescheduled \"American Idol,\" the highest-rated program on television to make room for an Obama press conference. Wednesday's news conference will be Obama's third in prime time. At the current pace, he is on track to hold one a month. \"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/IndustryInfo/Story?id=7451512&page=2\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

The conference, scheduled to air at 8 p.m. ET, will not just be held during prime time, but during the important sweeps period, costing the networks each millions of dollars in ad revenue. One source said Fox would lose $2 million to $3 million by airing the news conference instead of its regular programming. In 2000 Fox did not air a presidential debate and in 2001 it declined a request for airtime by President George W. Bush. ***So Libs can't say it was because it was Obama. They did it to Bush as well.*** Twice this year Fox has rescheduled \"American Idol,\" the highest-rated program on television to make room for an Obama press conference.
