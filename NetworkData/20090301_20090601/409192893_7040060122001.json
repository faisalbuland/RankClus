        "content": "Earlier this week, I noticed the left rear tire on my new (6 month old) Chevy Silverado pickup appeared to be low. This was before the \"Nanny-truck\" alerted me to it. Taking out my handy tire gauge, I discovered that it was, indeed, going down! Only 15 lbs of pressure! So...a trip to my friendly, local tire shop revealed a half-inch bolt shoved through the tire. It broke two or three of the steel belts on the factory-issued Goodyear Eagles, effectively ruining the tire. Yeah, it holds air with a boot and a patch, but it's fatally weakened and needs replaced. \"No problem,\" I says. \"Just mount the spare on the shiney wheel and put the \"dead\" tire on the spares' rim.\" It has a weak spot which will eventually result in a blow-out, but it's good enough for a spare tire. Oops. No can do! It turns out that my pickup has 20 inch wheels on the ground, but only a 17 inch spare! It's a \"tall\" tire, which matches up perfectly with the P275/55R20's on the ground, but it's only good as a spare and has no other useful value to me. I am NOT happy! While considering purchasing the vehicle, I asked the saleslady if it had a full-sized spare, not just a \"donut.\" \"Yes,\" she answered, and I bent down to verify that. It never occured to me to ask it that spare was the same size as the tires on the ground. That's a given, so far as I'm concerned...isn't it? Well...apparently not. It seems that EVERY GM truck has an off-sized spare tire! No other manufacturer does it, that I'm aware of, and a guy at Ford says it's because they save about $20 by doing that. Lessee....um...$20 x 1 million vehicles = $26,000,000! Naturally, I went back to the dealer and demanded a 20\" spare, but I'm not optimistic about getting one. The General Manager at the dealer where I bought it said, \"That's probably something from the manufacturer.\" \"Yeah, it is,\" I responded. \"And every truck on the lot is the same, right?\" She had to admit that, yes, that's all of them and they (the local dealer and sales staff) knows about it. To me (and I told her this), it's deceptive, dishonest and cause for me to never buy another GM product. If they'd have been forthright and up-front about it, I probably would have agreed with it.... but they weren't and I'm pizzed about it. I'm still waiting to see if they'll pony up the 20\" spare and rim I demanded. What do y'all think? Is this a good idea, a legimate cost-saving effort which causes the customer no real pain? Or is it a sleight of hand, a cheap sham which screws the customer for the company's benefit?",

Why would they spare a second or a dime on an issue that is almost certainly not going to cost them a sale? Other than yours, of course.

Personally, I think you caught a bad bit of luck here - you found yourself in the rare circumstance where the compatibility of the spare is an issue. For most it never will be, and that is why they do it. By the way, I sold Suzuki at first, but quickly shifted to Ford/Lincoln/Mercury. Yes, I still drive them and prefer them to GM (except the Corvette!).",

        "content": "Earlier this week, I noticed the left rear tire on my new (6 month old) Chevy Silverado pickup appeared to be low. This was before the \"Nanny-truck\" alerted me to it. Taking out my handy tire gauge, I discovered that it was, indeed, going down! Only 15 lbs of pressure! So...a trip to my friendly, local tire shop revealed a half-inch bolt shoved through the tire. It broke two or three of the steel belts on the factory-issued Goodyear Eagles, effectively ruining the tire. Yeah, it holds air with a boot and a patch, but it's fatally weakened and needs replaced. \"No problem,\" I says. \"Just mount the spare on the shiney wheel and put the \"dead\" tire on the spares' rim.\" It has a weak spot which will eventually result in a blow-out, but it's good enough for a spare tire. Oops. No can do! It turns out that my pickup has 20 inch wheels on the ground, but only a 17 inch spare! It's a \"tall\" tire, which matches up perfectly with the P275/55R20's on the ground, but it's only good as a spare and has no other useful value to me. I am NOT happy! While considering purchasing the vehicle, I asked the saleslady if it had a full-sized spare, not just a \"donut.\" \"Yes,\" she answered, and I bent down to verify that. It never occured to me to ask it that spare was the same size as the tires on the ground. That's a given, so far as I'm concerned...isn't it? Well...apparently not. It seems that EVERY GM truck has an off-sized spare tire! No other manufacturer does it, that I'm aware of, and a guy at Ford says it's because they save about $20 by doing that. Lessee....um...$20 x 1 million vehicles = $26,000,000! Naturally, I went back to the dealer and demanded a 20\" spare, but I'm not optimistic about getting one. The General Manager at the dealer where I bought it said, \"That's probably something from the manufacturer.\" \"Yeah, it is,\" I responded. \"And every truck on the lot is the same, right?\" She had to admit that, yes, that's all of them and they (the local dealer and sales staff) knows about it. To me (and I told her this), it's deceptive, dishonest and cause for me to never buy another GM product. If they'd have been forthright and up-front about it, I probably would have agreed with it.... but they weren't and I'm pizzed about it. I'm still waiting to see if they'll pony up the 20\" spare and rim I demanded. What do y'all think? Is this a good idea, a legimate cost-saving effort which causes the customer no real pain? Or is it a sleight of hand, a cheap sham which screws the customer for the company's benefit?",

A few observations: Calling the salesman ignorant is missing the point - salesman do not need to know all the details to sell a car. I knew a-holes who knew little more than the colors making $100k a year, while the honest ones who knew their vehicles inside and out were scraping by on $25k. It's like Congress - everyone knows that Congress is a bunch of lying weasels, but MY Congressman is honest. Same deal with car dealers - everyone knows they got the honest one. Guy I worked for paid his aunt $3k for a trade-in worth $9k. Honest. Also, car dealers, like any other business, focus on those items that increase sales and revenue. Spare tires are not visible, and other than the question of general size (i.e. donuts) are never a sales issue. Why would they spare a second or a dime on an issue that is almost certainly not going to cost them a sale? Other than yours, of course. Personally, I think you caught a bad bit of luck here - you found yourself in the rare circumstance where the compatibility of the spare is an issue. For most it never will be, and that is why they do it. By the way, I sold Suzuki at first, but quickly shifted to Ford/Lincoln/Mercury. Yes, I still drive them and prefer them to GM (except the Corvette!).",

        "reply": "I spent a year as a car salesman a ways back - got laid off and could not for the life of me find better work. A few observations: Calling the salesman ignorant is missing the point - salesman do not need to know all the details to sell a car. I knew a-holes who knew little more than the colors making $100k a year, while the honest ones who knew their vehicles inside and out were scraping by on $25k. It's like Congress - everyone knows that Congress is a bunch of lying weasels, but MY Congressman is honest. Same deal with car dealers - everyone knows they got the honest one. Guy I worked for paid his aunt $3k for a trade-in worth $9k. Honest. Also, car dealers, like any other business, focus on those items that increase sales and revenue. Spare tires are not visible, and other than the question of general size (i.e. donuts) are never a sales issue. Why would they spare a second or a dime on an issue that is almost certainly not going to cost them a sale? Other than yours, of course. Personally, I think you caught a bad bit of luck here - you found yourself in the rare circumstance where the compatibility of the spare is an issue. For most it never will be, and that is why they do it. By the way, I sold Suzuki at first, but quickly shifted to Ford/Lincoln/Mercury. Yes, I still drive them and prefer them to GM (except the Corvette!).",

        "content": "Earlier this week, I noticed the left rear tire on my new (6 month old) Chevy Silverado pickup appeared to be low. This was before the \"Nanny-truck\" alerted me to it. Taking out my handy tire gauge, I discovered that it was, indeed, going down! Only 15 lbs of pressure! So...a trip to my friendly, local tire shop revealed a half-inch bolt shoved through the tire. It broke two or three of the steel belts on the factory-issued Goodyear Eagles, effectively ruining the tire. Yeah, it holds air with a boot and a patch, but it's fatally weakened and needs replaced. \"No problem,\" I says. \"Just mount the spare on the shiney wheel and put the \"dead\" tire on the spares' rim.\" It has a weak spot which will eventually result in a blow-out, but it's good enough for a spare tire. Oops. No can do! It turns out that my pickup has 20 inch wheels on the ground, but only a 17 inch spare! It's a \"tall\" tire, which matches up perfectly with the P275/55R20's on the ground, but it's only good as a spare and has no other useful value to me. I am NOT happy! While considering purchasing the vehicle, I asked the saleslady if it had a full-sized spare, not just a \"donut.\" \"Yes,\" she answered, and I bent down to verify that. It never occured to me to ask it that spare was the same size as the tires on the ground. That's a given, so far as I'm concerned...isn't it? Well...apparently not. It seems that EVERY GM truck has an off-sized spare tire! No other manufacturer does it, that I'm aware of, and a guy at Ford says it's because they save about $20 by doing that. Lessee....um...$20 x 1 million vehicles = $26,000,000! Naturally, I went back to the dealer and demanded a 20\" spare, but I'm not optimistic about getting one. The General Manager at the dealer where I bought it said, \"That's probably something from the manufacturer.\" \"Yeah, it is,\" I responded. \"And every truck on the lot is the same, right?\" She had to admit that, yes, that's all of them and they (the local dealer and sales staff) knows about it. To me (and I told her this), it's deceptive, dishonest and cause for me to never buy another GM product. If they'd have been forthright and up-front about it, I probably would have agreed with it.... but they weren't and I'm pizzed about it. I'm still waiting to see if they'll pony up the 20\" spare and rim I demanded. What do y'all think? Is this a good idea, a legimate cost-saving effort which causes the customer no real pain? Or is it a sleight of hand, a cheap sham which screws the customer for the company's benefit?",

I have owned 5 Tacoma's over the years but as long as my Tundra holds up it will be the last one I ever buy. Oh and Kit, all dealers are scam artist. Its just a matter of what they know they can get away with and how stupid the public is. Write a few letters to the district manager or the Chamber of Commerce. CC it to them. Maybe that will help.",

It's like Congress - everyone knows that Congress is a bunch of lying weasels, but MY Congressman is honest. Same deal with car dealers - everyone knows they got the honest one. Guy I worked for paid his aunt $3k for a trade-in worth $9k. Honest. Also, car dealers, like any other business, focus on those items that increase sales and revenue. Spare tires are not visible, and other than the question of general size (i.e. donuts) are never a sales issue. Why would they spare a second or a dime on an issue that is almost certainly not going to cost them a sale? Other than yours, of course. Personally, I think you caught a bad bit of luck here - you found yourself in the rare circumstance where the compatibility of the spare is an issue. For most it never will be, and that is why they do it. By the way, I sold Suzuki at first, but quickly shifted to Ford/Lincoln/Mercury. Yes, I still drive them and prefer them to GM (except the Corvette!).",
