If this were to happen & a Taliban-type government came to power what does this do to th whole equation in that region? To me, it doesn't seem that far fetched. Given Mousharif(sp) came to power in a coup who is to say that the same couldn't happen but with a radical Muslim edge to the coup? How secure are Paki nukes? Could anyone envision US forces being dispatched to secure them if a coup occurred? Maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but is that far fetched?",
