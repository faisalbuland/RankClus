When you nullify those contracts, the vendor has no choice but to file bankruptcy as well, only most will go to liquidation. After that the big 3 will have to tool up to produce those parts in house. You may want to talk to a tool & die maker to get an understanding of the costs involved for that, but I'm willing to bet what they've asked for so far won't even come close to meeting the requirement.
