Khamenei's comments were the first top level reaction to a video message Obama released Friday in which he reached out to Iran on the occasion of Nowruz, the Persian new year. Khamenei holds the last word on major policy decisions, and how Iran ultimately responds to any concrete U.S. effort to engage the country will depend largely on his say. <more> http://www.military.com/news/article/irans-leader-dismi...obama-overtures.html Additional source ... quote: Title: Iran's Rebuff to Obama Provides Eye Into Theocracy's Mind-Set The Iranian leader's rebuff on Saturday to President Barack Obama's offer for dialogue was swift and sweeping: Words from Washington ring hollow without deep policy changes. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's response was more than just a dismissive slap at the outreach. It was a broad lesson in the mind-set of Iran's all-powerful theocracy and how it will dictate the pace and tone of any new steps by Obama to chip away at their nearly 30-year diplomatic freeze. \"It's the first stage of the bargaining in classic Iranian style: Be tough and play up your toughness,\" said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of regional politics at United Arab Emirates University. \"The Iranian leaders are not about concessions at this stage. It's still all about ideology from the Iranian side.\" <more> \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,510020,00.html\"",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Are you reading the same board as I am? Not everyone does it but some of you lot can patronise foreigners to Olympic standards and sometimes your Government reflects this tendency. Anyway I think that some people are making the false assumptions that A) Obama's message was directed mainly at the Iranian leadership and B) that the Ayatollah's response was unexpected. Both assumptions are, I think, fallacious. The Ayatollahs were always going to be negative because great deal of their influence is reliant on America being the \"Great Satan\" and the enemy of all Iranians. On the other hand the people of Iran might see the message somewhat differently and it will hopefully give some succour to the reform movement that was burgeoning before the \"Axis of Evil\" speech but which Bush's words seriously undermined. There's also the fact that according to the traditions of that part of the world honour has been satisfied, Obama has honestly offered to treat with Iran peacefully but if they have rejected his offer the US is now free to take other steps against Iran.",

Both assumptions are, I think, fallacious. The Ayatollahs were always going to be negative because great deal of their influence is reliant on America being the \"Great Satan\" and the enemy of all Iranians. On the other hand the people of Iran might see the message somewhat differently and it will hopefully give some succour to the reform movement that was burgeoning before the \"Axis of Evil\" speech but which Bush's words seriously undermined. There's also the fact that according to the traditions of that part of the world honour has been satisfied, Obama has honestly offered to treat with Iran peacefully but if they have rejected his offer the US is now free to take other steps against Iran. Just remember, that the opinions expressed on these boards, are those of the posters and not that of the U.S. Government... Some of us, me included, see the Europeans as a group of people who like to argue amongst themselves and drive knives into each others backs... Not saying that that is an accurate assessment but, we are mostly separated from you fine folks by the Atlantic and two hundred plus years, so please forgive us, as a people, not the government, if we see you differently as you see yourselves...

What worries, at least me, is that if Iran goes nuclear, they will use their weapon on Israel and Israel will retaliate...

Remember there are \"conservative\" democrats also and yes, the democratic party is just as guilty as the republican party, for being out for the \"all mighty dollar\"... I think that when President Bush 41 proclaimed the \"New World Order\", he was in fact, talking about what you are and yes, it was a plan promulgated by his father, Prescott Bush... If most folks would honestly take the time to research into what brought us the first depression in the thirties, it was the same policies that brought us to this one... There are differences now, than then, for a recovery and yes, President Obama is trying to use the \"Roosevelt\" model to straighten the mess out... The sad thing is, President Obama was originally thinking for himself, especially during his campaign, when he talked of renegotiating NAFTA and it's Asian counterparts and \"Buy American\", but he has forsaken those ideas and is trying to follow the Roosevelt model, picking all the bad parts and none of the good parts... Oh, one thing that I advocate, is another Smoot-Hawley tariff act... Yes, it will deepen the depression, yes folks that's what we are in, but, it will force our industrial base back on shore, just as it did in the 1930s...

If that is the case one would hope that he would learn from Bush's mistakes and not try and destabilise another country in that region while Pakistan is teetering on the brink of anarchy. Let's not forget Pakistan has nuclear weapons. I would think that Iran going nuclear even with it's present regime would be a lot less frightening than the Talibs and AQ getting their grubby paws on any working weapons. For a start the Ayatollahs are comparatively reasonable compared with your average Talib head shed. Furthermore despite their leaders' rhetoric the loathing of the West is not as visceral as that reported to be taking hold on the NW Frontier (which Omah reports is a complete turnaround from the situation their when he visited as a student in 1991 - possible the reward for the CIA et al dropping the area post USSR pull-out). The Obama presidentcy fumbles their balls once again Seems like every day is another day on the road to recognition of just how bad this president is! Obama didn\u2019t fumble anything. Being a republican, I can understand how you might not recognize ideological rhetoric when you see it. I think most of us probably understand what Obama\u2019s message represented and probably accomplished: 1. Provided an opening for young Iranians to begin putting pressure on the clergy as they were prior to Bush galvanizing them with his axis of evil junk. 2. Showed the world that he was willing to talk to adversaries thereby demonstrating we\u2019re resuming our diplomatic leadership role, not the world\u2019s super-pariah. 3. Placed the Iranian leadership in a position of appearing unreasonable (more unreasonable than they appeared before). This lays a ground work for further strengthening a coalition which might be needed at a future point. I understand that invading every country that doesn\u2019t happen to like us is the neoconservative version of foreign policy, but it doesn\u2019t always work. If military action is required in the future, it\u2019s easier to gather your allies when they trust you to not be trying to fulfill the \u201cProject for a New American Century\u201d doctrine.

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Admittedly I let my emotions get the best of me at times but I meant what I said about the neoconservative foreign policy agenda. Let me be clear to differentiate between neoconservative and conservative or Republican. I am one of those conspiracy theory nuts that believe the traditional conservative leadership of the Republican Party was usurped by a group of authoritarians. Those individuals may have originally claimed to be liberals; however they were no more liberal than they are now conservative. Their goal was wealth and power and they proved they would hitch their wagon to any party that could provide a means to their end. These folks are the people I refer to, the authors of the Project for a New American Century and the driving force behind this country\u2019s economic and foreign policies for a number of years.

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Are you reading the same board as I am? Not everyone does it but some of you lot can patronise foreigners to Olympic standards and sometimes your Government reflects this tendency. Anyway I think that some people are making the false assumptions that A) Obama's message was directed mainly at the Iranian leadership and B) that the Ayatollah's response was unexpected. Both assumptions are, I think, fallacious. The Ayatollahs were always going to be negative because great deal of their influence is reliant on America being the \"Great Satan\" and the enemy of all Iranians. On the other hand the people of Iran might see the message somewhat differently and it will hopefully give some succour to the reform movement that was burgeoning before the \"Axis of Evil\" speech but which Bush's words seriously undermined. There's also the fact that according to the traditions of that part of the world honour has been satisfied, Obama has honestly offered to treat with Iran peacefully but if they have rejected his offer the US is now free to take other steps against Iran.",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Admittedly I let my emotions get the best of me at times but I meant what I said about the neoconservative foreign policy agenda. Let me be clear to differentiate between neoconservative and conservative or Republican. I am one of those conspiracy theory nuts that believe the traditional conservative leadership of the Republican Party was usurped by a group of authoritarians. Those individuals may have originally claimed to be liberals; however they were no more liberal than they are now conservative. Their goal was wealth and power and they proved they would hitch their wagon to any party that could provide a means to their end. These folks are the people I refer to, the authors of the Project for a New American Century and the driving force behind this country\u2019s economic and foreign policies for a number of years.",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Are you reading the same board as I am? Not everyone does it but some of you lot can patronise foreigners to Olympic standards and sometimes your Government reflects this tendency. Anyway I think that some people are making the false assumptions that A) Obama's message was directed mainly at the Iranian leadership and B) that the Ayatollah's response was unexpected. Both assumptions are, I think, fallacious. The Ayatollahs were always going to be negative because great deal of their influence is reliant on America being the \"Great Satan\" and the enemy of all Iranians. On the other hand the people of Iran might see the message somewhat differently and it will hopefully give some succour to the reform movement that was burgeoning before the \"Axis of Evil\" speech but which Bush's words seriously undermined. There's also the fact that according to the traditions of that part of the world honour has been satisfied, Obama has honestly offered to treat with Iran peacefully but if they have rejected his offer the US is now free to take other steps against Iran.",

Provided an opening for young Iranians to begin putting pressure on the clergy as they were prior to Bush galvanizing them with his axis of evil junk. 2. Showed the world that he was willing to talk to adversaries thereby demonstrating we\u2019re resuming our diplomatic leadership role, not the world\u2019s super-pariah. 3. Placed the Iranian leadership in a position of appearing unreasonable (more unreasonable than they appeared before). This lays a ground work for further strengthening a coalition which might be needed at a future point. I understand that invading every country that doesn\u2019t happen to like us is the neoconservative version of foreign policy, but it doesn\u2019t always work. If military action is required in the future, it\u2019s easier to gather your allies when they trust you to not be trying to fulfill the \u201cProject for a New American Century\u201d doctrine. Where do you come up with this cr@p?... You started great and then went into a political rant... La vie en rose!... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Admittedly I let my emotions get the best of me at times but I meant what I said about the neoconservative foreign policy agenda. Let me be clear to differentiate between neoconservative and conservative or Republican. I am one of those conspiracy theory nuts that believe the traditional conservative leadership of the Republican Party was usurped by a group of authoritarians. Those individuals may have originally claimed to be liberals; however they were no more liberal than they are now conservative. Their goal was wealth and power and they proved they would hitch their wagon to any party that could provide a means to their end. These folks are the people I refer to, the authors of the Project for a New American Century and the driving force behind this country\u2019s economic and foreign policies for a number of years. If you had included the democratic party in that little set to, I might agree, to a certain extent... Remember there are \"conservative\" democrats also and yes, the democratic party is just as guilty as the republican party, for being out for the \"all mighty dollar\"... I think that when President Bush 41 proclaimed the \"New World Order\", he was in fact, talking about what you are and yes, it was a plan promulgated by his father, Prescott Bush... If most folks would honestly take the time to research into what brought us the first depression in the thirties, it was the same policies that brought us to this one... There are differences now, than then, for a recovery and yes, President Obama is trying to use the \"Roosevelt\" model to straighten the mess out... The sad thing is, President Obama was originally thinking for himself, especially during his campaign, when he talked of renegotiating NAFTA and it's Asian counterparts and \"Buy American\", but he has forsaken those ideas and is trying to follow the Roosevelt model, picking all the bad parts and none of the good parts... Oh, one thing that I advocate, is another Smoot-Hawley tariff act... Yes, it will deepen the depression, yes folks that's what we are in, but, it will force our industrial base back on shore, just as it did in the 1930s... It is bitter medicine but, the sooner we take it, the sooner the \"bad taste\" leaves our mouths... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Are you reading the same board as I am? Not everyone does it but some of you lot can patronise foreigners to Olympic standards and sometimes your Government reflects this tendency. Anyway I think that some people are making the false assumptions that A) Obama's message was directed mainly at the Iranian leadership and B) that the Ayatollah's response was unexpected. Both assumptions are, I think, fallacious. The Ayatollahs were always going to be negative because great deal of their influence is reliant on America being the \"Great Satan\" and the enemy of all Iranians. On the other hand the people of Iran might see the message somewhat differently and it will hopefully give some succour to the reform movement that was burgeoning before the \"Axis of Evil\" speech but which Bush's words seriously undermined. There's also the fact that according to the traditions of that part of the world honour has been satisfied, Obama has honestly offered to treat with Iran peacefully but if they have rejected his offer the US is now free to take other steps against Iran.",

If you had included the democratic party in that little set to, I might agree, to a certain extent... Remember there are \"conservative\" democrats also and yes, the democratic party is just as guilty as the republican party, for being out for the \"all mighty dollar\"... I think that when President Bush 41 proclaimed the \"New World Order\", he was in fact, talking about what you are and yes, it was a plan promulgated by his father, Prescott Bush... If most folks would honestly take the time to research into what brought us the first depression in the thirties, it was the same policies that brought us to this one... There are differences now, than then, for a recovery and yes, President Obama is trying to use the \"Roosevelt\" model to straighten the mess out... The sad thing is, President Obama was originally thinking for himself, especially during his campaign, when he talked of renegotiating NAFTA and it's Asian counterparts and \"Buy American\", but he has forsaken those ideas and is trying to follow the Roosevelt model, picking all the bad parts and none of the good parts... Oh, one thing that I advocate, is another Smoot-Hawley tariff act... Yes, it will deepen the depression, yes folks that's what we are in, but, it will force our industrial base back on shore, just as it did in the 1930s... It is bitter medicine but, the sooner we take it, the sooner the \"bad taste\" leaves our mouths... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Are you reading the same board as I am? Not everyone does it but some of you lot can patronise foreigners to Olympic standards and sometimes your Government reflects this tendency. Anyway I think that some people are making the false assumptions that A) Obama's message was directed mainly at the Iranian leadership and B) that the Ayatollah's response was unexpected. Both assumptions are, I think, fallacious. The Ayatollahs were always going to be negative because great deal of their influence is reliant on America being the \"Great Satan\" and the enemy of all Iranians. On the other hand the people of Iran might see the message somewhat differently and it will hopefully give some succour to the reform movement that was burgeoning before the \"Axis of Evil\" speech but which Bush's words seriously undermined.
