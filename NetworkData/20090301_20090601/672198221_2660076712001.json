Likewise, income tax should be proportional to income. There are sensitive issues. Windfall profits tax is a sensitive issue and most Oil Companies think it is BS. They work in a cyclical industry and when profits are below the rate of return they do not get tax brakes to suppliment the Windfall Profits Taxes in good years. So I can see their point. Most CEO's are upset these days that foriegn competitors are not playing under the same set of rules they are forced to play under. So it's not a domestic tax issue. It's a law enforcement issue, sometimes a tarrif issue and sometimes just protectionism. So I don't see increased taxes as a immediate problem.",

Unfortunately for the unions and union propaganda, it's not 1910 anymore. Fact is, you can compare pay v/s cost of living, unemployment rates, etc in union v/s right-to-work states and it's blatantly obvious that in today's market, unions do NOTHING for the American worker. The only thing UAW does for Joe Assembler is suck money out of his pocket in the form of dues that go to support the welfare system known as \"union leadership\". You can google \"pullman strike\", I can google \"sikorsky strike\". Oh, yeah, there's some of unions' finest.

Jobs will be lost, the Companies WILL have their annual meetintings at Dubai and so on. Mr. Obama is creating the mood that requires any PRUDENT CEO to take steps to protect capatal. If the tax threats are carried out, to have prudently moved the profit out of reach, and then the persons income protected from confiscation. In the USSR there was a saying, \"We pretend to work, they pretend to pay us.\" It seems that is acceptable to this current administration, but not to me. or to any company I'd own stock in. OK, I am ignorant on CAP and TRADE and I'll need to read up on that now I guess. However, once again I am in the unenviable position of defending President Obama and have to partly side with the liberal position on this issue (yuk!!). President Obama does need to reform taxes on the wealthy and on Corporations. He has been told this by the wealthy and the Corporations themselves believe it or not. When things get so bad that those about to be taxed ask for more taxes......the system is unfair and needs rebalancing, in my opinion. I agree with you to the extent the Pendulum needs to be controlled and not swing too much over into the tax and spend area. Some of the past tax breaks need to be undone though. I do not agree with the theory of redistribution of wealth. However, someone that has 10 times the property that I do, needs to be taxed at 10 times the amount in property taxes that I do because that is their fair share. Likewise, income tax should be proportional to income. There are sensitive issues. Windfall profits tax is a sensitive issue and most Oil Companies think it is BS. They work in a cyclical industry and when profits are below the rate of return they do not get tax brakes to suppliment the Windfall Profits Taxes in good years. So I can see their point. Most CEO's are upset these days that foriegn competitors are not playing under the same set of rules they are forced to play under. So it's not a domestic tax issue. It's a law enforcement issue, sometimes a tarrif issue and sometimes just protectionism. So I don't see increased taxes as a immediate problem.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by peter3_1: ERICH, I own exxon stock too. Here's the point, if \"cap and trade\" (whould be wrack and ruin) takes place, income and corperate taxes are increased as per Mr. Obama, income, profit, and perks will be removed from the USA. Jobs will be lost, the Companies WILL have their annual meetintings at Dubai and so on. Mr. Obama is creating the mood that requires any PRUDENT CEO to take steps to protect capatal. If the tax threats are carried out, to have prudently moved the profit out of reach, and then the persons income protected from confiscation. In the USSR there was a saying, \"We pretend to work, they pretend to pay us.\" It seems that is acceptable to this current administration, but not to me. or to any company I'd own stock in.",
