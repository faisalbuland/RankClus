Possibly another example of the level of the type of incompetence within the Justice Department (and possibly NSA) during the last Administration? Remember - a case prosecuted against former Senator Ted Stevens was thrown out because of possible prosecutorial misconduct. After reading this story from several sources, including CNN, CQ.com, and NPR, it appears that a. She was speaking on the phone with a gentleman named Heim Saban, one of the wealthiest men in the world and supporter of Israel. b. The NSA was supposedly intercepting a communication that Harman was part of. However, she wasn't supposed to be the subject of that intercept. So, Saban would have had to be the subject. c. This information got to the Justice Department, who was going to launch an investigation. Somewhere along the line, they came to their senses and backed off. From what I can surmise, there are problems here. First, if NSA had gotten involved, it was because one of the persons had to be from outside the United States. Further, if the NSA was doing this, a FISA warrant would have been necessary under normal circumstances. Secondly, there was no foreign contact on this call if it were Saban. He's a Californian and an American citizen. NSA got its potentially illegally-acquired information and passed it to the Justice Department, and the FBI started an investigation based on it. However, they were ordered by former Attorney General Gonzales to stand down on the investigation of Harman because she was a supporter of the warrantless wiretapping program and her support was needed. Now, the cat's out of the bag. Did Harman break the law? Maybe she did - but once again, incompetence screwed up the case.",
