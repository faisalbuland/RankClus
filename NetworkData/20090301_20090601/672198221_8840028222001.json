That was specified about some briefings given to others. I asked CIA spokesperson Paul Gimigliano why. His answer: Because the notes and memos on the Pelosi meeting that form the basis for the docs didn\u2019t allow them to go that far, meaning that they didn\u2019t specify that she\u2019d been briefed on waterboarding in particular.\" \"To be clear, this doesn\u2019t prove conclusively that Pelosi, who says she was only told of the legality of techniques, wasn\u2019t briefed on the use of waterboarding. But if she was, no one made a specific note of it in any of the records the CIA is aware of.\" So What your hanging your argument on is this Even though the cia and administration testified that the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" where legal [and thus not torture] She should have leaked the info anyway?

        "reply": " In order to hear these briefings, you have to make a sworn statement that you will not reveal to ANYONE what you heard. I would like to know WTF does COngressional Immunity have to do with this? Now maybe you feel that an oath is just empty BS, but I CALL YOU ON THAT! You AND Line DOggie would be calling her a traitor, and if you were honest you would admit it. Simply saying that, \"whaaa, whaaa, you wouldn't say that if she was a Republican,\" is pure nonsense. Just an intellectual out to avoid what I said. Dave",

I dont care that she lied about it so much(Frankly I expect it from her), but that she was perfectly willing to send people to Jail KNOWING that she could have stopped it and that she asked Questions if the now so-called torture was tough enough. If she's that easily willing to send some poor schmucks to prison for writing a Memo, it spells paragraphs for her Dishonesty and total lack of a Moral compass. That you seem more than willing to ignore that facet of her is also telling. Still waiting for the list of members of the Intelligence Committees who broke their oaths and revealed secrets. You have time, I'm not even much pass \"aa\" in the phone book. Dave",

In the newly-released documents detailing the torture briefings given to members of Congress, the portion describing Pelosi\u2019s single briefing says she was told about the use of enhanced interrogation techniques in general, but doesn\u2019t specify whether she was told about the use of waterboarding. That was specified about some briefings given to others. I asked CIA spokesperson Paul Gimigliano why. His answer: Because the notes and memos on the Pelosi meeting that form the basis for the docs didn\u2019t allow them to go that far, meaning that they didn\u2019t specify that she\u2019d been briefed on waterboarding in particular.\" \"To be clear, this doesn\u2019t prove conclusively that Pelosi, who says she was only told of the legality of techniques, wasn\u2019t briefed on the use of waterboarding. But if she was, no one made a specific note of it in any of the records the CIA is aware of.\" So What your hanging your argument on is this Even though the cia and administration testified that the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" where legal [and thus not torture] She should have leaked the info anyway? Look -- I would like to see the lady get voted out for many reasons of my own but will the info that is available to us right now -- this is not one of them. -- Savage >>http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/torture/cia-notes-on-pelosi-meeting-dont-specify-briefing-on-waterboarding/",
