An invitation was extended to me by trial lawyers from the Counterterrorism Section, who are members of the Task Force, which you are leading. The invitation email (of April 14) indicates that the meeting is part of an ongoing effort to identify lawful policies on the detention and disposition of alien enemy combatants\u2014or what the Department now calls \u201cindividuals captured or apprehended in connection with armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations.\u201d I admire the lawyers of the Counterterrorism Division, and I do not question their good faith. Nevertheless, it is quite clear\u2014most recently, from your provocative remarks on Wednesday in Germany\u2014that the Obama administration has already settled on a policy of releasing trained jihadists (including releasing some of them into the United States). Whatever the good intentions of the organizers, the meeting will obviously be used by the administration to claim that its policy was arrived at in consultation with current and former government officials experienced in terrorism cases and national security issues. I deeply disagree with this policy, which I believe is a violation of federal law and a betrayal of the president\u2019s first obligation to protect the American people. Under the circumstances, I think the better course is to register my dissent, rather than be used as a prop. Moreover, in light of public statements by both you and the President, it is dismayingly clear that, under your leadership, the Justice Department takes the position that a lawyer who in good faith offers legal advice to government policy makers\u2014like the government lawyers who offered good faith advice on interrogation policy\u2014may be subject to investigation and prosecution for the content of that advice, in addition to empty but professionally damaging accusations of ethical misconduct. Given that stance, any prudent lawyer would have to hesitate before offering advice to the government. Beyond that, as elucidated in my writing (including my proposal for a new national security court, which I understand the Task Force has perused), I believe alien enemy combatants should be detained at Guantanamo Bay (or a facility like it) until the conclusion of hostilities. This national defense measure is deeply rooted in the venerable laws of war and was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the 2004 Hamdi case.

But their proponents, and adherents to both the military and civilian justice approaches, have all agreed on at least one thing: Foreign terrorists trained to execute mass-murder attacks cannot simply be released while the war ensues and Americans are still being targeted. We have already released too many jihadists who, as night follows day, have resumed plotting to kill Americans. Indeed, according to recent reports, a released Guantanamodetainee is now leading Taliban combat operations in Afghanistan, where President Obama has just sent additional American forces.

        "quote": "Originally posted by L0A1: This guy has Ballz! I am pretty sure threerings typed something along these lines in another thread about torture. quote: By email (to the Counterterrorism Division) and by regular mail: The Honorable Eric H. Holder, Jr. Attorney General of the United States United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20530-0001 Dear Attorney General Holder: This letter is respectfully submitted to inform you that I must decline the invitation to participate in the May 4 roundtable meeting the President\u2019s Task Force on Detention Policy is convening with current and former prosecutors involved in international terrorism cases. An invitation was extended to me by trial lawyers from the Counterterrorism Section, who are members of the Task Force, which you are leading. The invitation email (of April 14) indicates that the meeting is part of an ongoing effort to identify lawful policies on the detention and disposition of alien enemy combatants\u2014or what the Department now calls \u201cindividuals captured or apprehended in connection with armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations.\u201d I admire the lawyers of the Counterterrorism Division, and I do not question their good faith. Nevertheless, it is quite clear\u2014most recently, from your provocative remarks on Wednesday in Germany\u2014that the Obama administration has already settled on a policy of releasing trained jihadists (including releasing some of them into the United States). Whatever the good intentions of the organizers, the meeting will obviously be used by the administration to claim that its policy was arrived at in consultation with current and former government officials experienced in terrorism cases and national security issues. I deeply disagree with this policy, which I believe is a violation of federal law and a betrayal of the president\u2019s first obligation to protect the American people. Under the circumstances, I think the better course is to register my dissent, rather than be used as a prop. Moreover, in light of public statements by both you and the President, it is dismayingly clear that, under your leadership, the Justice Department takes the position that a lawyer who in good faith offers legal advice to government policy makers\u2014like the government lawyers who offered good faith advice on interrogation policy\u2014may be subject to investigation and prosecution for the content of that advice, in addition to empty but professionally damaging accusations of ethical misconduct. Given that stance, any prudent lawyer would have to hesitate before offering advice to the government. Beyond that, as elucidated in my writing (including my proposal for a new national security court, which I understand the Task Force has perused), I believe alien enemy combatants should be detained at Guantanamo Bay (or a facility like it) until the conclusion of hostilities. This national defense measure is deeply rooted in the venerable laws of war and was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the 2004 Hamdi case. Yet, as recently as Wednesday, you asserted that, in your considered judgment, such notions violate America\u2019s \u201ccommitment to the rule of law.\u201d Indeed, you elaborated, \u201cNothing symbolizes our [adminstration\u2019s] new course more than our decision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay\u2026. President Obama believes, and I strongly agree, that Guantanamo has come to represent a time and an approach that we want to put behind us: a disregard for our centuries-long respect for the rule of law[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Given your policy of conducting ruinous criminal and ethics investigations of lawyers over the advice they offer the government, and your specific position that the wartime detention I would endorse is tantamount to a violation of law, it makes little sense for me to attend the Task Force meeting. After all, my choice would be to remain silent or risk jeopardizing myself. For what it may be worth, I will say this much. For eight years, we have had a robust debate in the United States about how to handle alien terrorists captured during a defensive war authorized by Congress after nearly 3000 of our fellow Americans were annihilated. Essentially, there have been two camps. One calls for prosecution in the civilian criminal justice system, the strategy used throughout the 1990s. The other calls for a military justice approach of combatant detention and war-crimes prosecutions by military commission. Because each theory has its downsides, many commentators, myself included, have proposed a third way: a hybrid system, designed for the realities of modern international terrorism\u2014a new system that would address the needs to protect our classified defense secrets and to assure Americans, as well as our allies, that we are detaining the right people. There are differences in these various proposals. But their proponents, and adherents to both the military and civilian justice approaches, have all agreed on at least one thing: Foreign terrorists trained to execute mass-murder attacks cannot simply be released while the war ensues and Americans are still being targeted. We have already released too many jihadists who, as night follows day, have resumed plotting to kill Americans. Indeed, according to recent reports, a released Guantanamodetainee is now leading Taliban combat operations in Afghanistan, where President Obama has just sent additional American forces. The Obama campaign smeared Guantanamo Bay as a human rights blight. Consistent with that hyperbolic rhetoric, the President began his administration by promising to close the detention camp within a year. The President did this even though he and you (a) agree Gitmo is a top-flight prison facility, (b) acknowledge that our nation is still at war, and (c) concede that many Gitmo detainees are extremely dangerous terrorists who cannot be tried under civilian court rules. Patently, the commitment to close Guantanamo Bay within a year was made without a plan for what to do with these detainees who cannot be tried. Consequently, the Detention Policy Task Force is not an effort to arrive at the best policy. It is an effort to justify a bad policy that has already been adopted: to wit, the Obama administration policy to release trained terrorists outright if that\u2019s what it takes to close Gitmo by January. Obviously, I am powerless to stop the administration from releasing top al Qaeda operatives who planned mass-murder attacks against American cities\u2014like Binyam Mohammed (the accomplice of \u201cDirty Bomber\u201d Jose Padilla) whom the administration recently transferred to Britain, where he is now at liberty and living on public assistance. I am similarly powerless to stop the administration from admitting into the United States such alien jihadists as the 17 remaining Uighur detainees. According to National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair, the Uighurs will apparently live freely, on American taxpayer assistance, despite the facts that they are affiliated with a terrorist organization and have received terrorist paramilitary training. Under federal immigration law (the 2005 REAL ID Act), those facts render them excludable from theUnited States. The Uighurs\u2019 impending release is thus a remarkable development given the Obama administration\u2019s propensity to deride its predecessor\u2019s purported insensitivity to the rule of law. I am, in addition, powerless to stop the President, as he takes these reckless steps, from touting his Detention Policy Task Force as a demonstration of his national security seriousness. But I can decline to participate in the charade. Finally, let me repeat that I respect and admire the dedication of Justice Department lawyers, whom I have tirelessly defended since I retired in 2003 as a chief assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. It was a unique honor to serve for nearly twenty years as a federal prosecutor, under administrations of both parties. It was as proud a day as I have ever had when the trial team I led was awarded the Attorney General\u2019s Exceptional Service Award in 1996, after we secured the convictions of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and his underlings for waging a terrorist war against the United States. I particularly appreciated receiving the award from Attorney General Reno\u2014as I recounted in Willful Blindness, my book about the case, without her steadfastness against opposition from short-sighted government officials who wanted to release him, the \u201cblind sheikh\u201d would never have been indicted, much less convicted and so deservedly sentenced to life-imprisonment. In any event, I\u2019ve always believed defending our nation is a duty of citizenship, not ideology. Thus, my conservative political views aside, I\u2019ve made myself available to liberal and conservative groups, to Democrats and Republicans, who\u2019ve thought tapping my experience would be beneficial. It pains me to decline your invitation, but the attendant circumstances leave no other option. Very truly yours, Andrew C. McCarthy cc: Sylvia T.

PBO already dictated the course of events and does not need another \"yes man\" to sit in scorn at that table. I am sure you are familiar with the story of the emperor's new clothes. Well, there you go, Mr. McCarthy would just be the one saying the emperor is naked. As for the tainting of our \"legal and security mechanisms\", that happened when FBI agents were embedded to determine the legality of any option available on the front lines of combat. And that was all about politics simply because a few malcontents did not like that President Bush exercised his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to conduct military operations since Congress approved the actions (whether based on fallacies of information or not, they still approved it and are on record. I guess they should not have been so reactionary.) and he conducted those operations within the scope of the law and the Constitution. The debate Congress has been relying on has been a political one, not a legal one. The voters who listen to the malcontents determined that they know better than the administration they elected and decided that what was going on was not legal. It seems to me that the Obama administration has engaged more in that \"with-me-or-against-me\" philosophy than President Bush. The new administration will just have to find their own \"yes men\" since there is an ever-growing list of those who are saying \"no, thanks, I have something better to do with my time.\" What goes around...",

Read his National Review blog post here: \"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzFmZGNiMjM2OTgzNDRlYzNmY2UzMmQ2ZDVjODJkZDc=\" His letter would have far more credibility if he used a little more factual information. How many of those persons who've been detained have been determined to have been a \"trained jihadist\", since virtually none of them have had a proper status review? He seems to be repeating the standard talking points. He also speaks of Obama's releasing of Binyam Mohammed. Well, all charges against Mohammed were dropped in October 2008. And, as far as \"robust debate\" is concerned - there was no debate over the past eight years. It was that Trotskyite \"for-me-or-against-me\" nonsense, and whoever didn't go along with the program was labeled unpatriotic or worse. I think Mr. McCarthy's credentials speak for themselves. It is truly amazing how many people try to discredit those who can make a qualified judgment based on, what, a disagreement with their opinions? In the first place how many times did you scream that the civilian federal court system should be the ones reviewing and evaluating the cases rather than the military tribunals? Now here is one who is qualified to do so and you back-pedal and say \"no-no-no! You don't have all the proper facts,\" when in reality, you are saying \"you are not qualified because you disagree with the administration. That sounds an awful lot like when you disagreed with the last administration. Do we say you were unqualified based on that parameter? I am sure he has heard more than his fair share of the debate that you may not really have been privy to. The illustration he is trying to make in my opinion is that there should not have been any releases of these enemy combatants because they were not eligible to have been tried in our court system. How many others were released and went right back to have been identified as a body with an exploded bomb strapped to them? Several are documented. Now the administration is getting ready to open the flood gates and release dozens to complete their objective. What will you say then? His \"credentials\" are what they are. I was referring to his statements, almost all of which were not based on facts. His experience is that of a prosecuting attorney, who operated within the sphere of United States law. All his insight is informed by that. When he speaks of internees at GTMO, he has no particular expertise, since a) those men were under the control of the US military, and b) since they were at GTMO, they were out of the scope of US law. Hence, he speaks of them as \"enemy combatants\", a term that is informed by nothing more than the decree of the then-SECDEF and his lawyers. Whatever \"debate\" he has listened to, it is from the vantage point of an outsider, since Justice's prosecutors had no role in incarceration and prosecution - and, based on his writings, it has been further colored by his political leanings. The challenges faced by our country and its legal and security mechanisms should not be tainted by either political ideology or emotion. He approaches the problem, in this \"letter\", from both those angles. And the \"floodgates\" at GTMO were opened well before Obama took the oath of office. By January of this year, over 400 of the close to 780 detainees there were released without charges levied against them. \"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/guantanamo-bay_detainees.htm\"",
