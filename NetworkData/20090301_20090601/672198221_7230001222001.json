Texas by itself could probably raise an army and navy in no time. However, since I am a native Texan i can testify that no one really talks about or even thinks about secession.",

The articles I read sounded like a panic to me. \"Just before the workday began on Monday, an airliner and supersonic fighter jet zoomed past the lower Manhattan skyline. Within minutes, startled financial workers streamed out of their offices, fearing a nightmarish replay of Sept. 11.\" Evidently a few heads were rolled, disciplinary letters filed, and the president got mad or embarrassed. But then I guess we have to take it with a grain of salt as everyone knows how that liberal media as well as the New York Times can stretch the truth. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",

You are seeing the the lunatic fringe of Texas society. Unfortunately, I suspect it will take the imposition of Martial Law (at least here in TX) to put this BS to an end. Aren't you over reacting a bit there PD? Not in the least. I do not consider secession to be something to be joked about - and those who attempt to incite secession need to be dealt with in the harshest manner possible as publicly as possible. What happened to her freedom of speech? She was talking about voting some of the Congressmen/women out of office in Washington, so obviously she plans to be part of the union for another couple years. Anyway, what is the big deal? To hear the liberal pundits and media talk, only a few thousand people showed up at tea parties. Freedom of speech ends where it impedes on other's rights to safety and peace - which is why inciting violence is against the law. Remember the old \"yelling FIRE in a crowded theater\" reasoning that the courts use? As to the number of folks at the Tea Parties - remember, it only took two nutcases hyped up on right-wing rhetoric to blow up the Oklahoma City Federal Building......... I didn't get the impression that she was inciting anything other than talk. The stunt of flying a 747 over NYC for publicity that had people running out of office buildings and ducking for cover would be more in line with the \"fire\" issue. 747's fly over NYC every single day....and very low at that. In case you didn't know, both La Guardia and JFK Int'l airports are less than 1 minute flying time (at 165kts airspeed which is common for landing) from the Manhattan skyline. I hate to say it about those who panicked, but they let their fear get the better of them on that one - and the sad part is that now they look bad because they were running from the one plane that was least likely to crash into them.",
