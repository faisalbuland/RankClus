The lawsuit says a New York City police officer told the man, Bradford Campeau-Laurion, not to leave his seat section during \"God Bless America,\" which the Yankees play over loudspeakers during a break in the game. The incident took place Aug. 26 during a Red Sox game. The suit seeks compensatory damages and a ruling that stops the Yankees from requiring people to participate in religious or political activities. Police said the resident of Queens was unruly and reeked of alcohol. Should people be forced to remain in their seats and not be allowed to go to the restrooms at a public venue (athletic stadium, movie theater, NASCAR race track, etc?) when a patriotic song (that is not the National Anthem) is being played? And, for those who will justify the police officer's actions on the reported fact that he said the person was \"unruly and reeked of alcohol\", who sold him the alcohol? The New York Yankees concession stands! Seems to me that the New York Yankees management would want to have the ticket holder use the restroom, even during the playing of \"God Bless America\", rather than urinate on his seat.",
