Private Timothy Bennitt faces charges of involuntary manslaughter and wrongful distribution and use of controlled substances. On Feb. 15, medics found two teens, both 16, unresponsive in the barracks around 3:30 a.m. Leah King was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other was rushed to Madigan Army Medical Center. The surviving teen was treated and discharged a few days later. She has not been identified. Investigators say Bennitt, of Rolling Prairie, Ind., provided Leah with the prescription pain killer Opana and anti-depressant Xanax. The pills were then crushed, mixed together, and snorted with a dollar bill, investigators said. The pills are designed to release their effects over time but, when snorted, it had a toxic effect, investigators said. Both girls are from the south Puget Sound area and are not military dependents. Military investigators say Bennitt is also being investigated for distributing drugs to other soldiers prior to this incident, including giving Xanax, Opana, Percocet, and marijuana. If convicted on all counts, Bennitt would be dishonorably discharged and could be sentenced to up to 82 years in a military prison. At the moment, Bennitt remains with his unit, where he is a heavy construction equipment operator as part of the 555th Engineer Brigade. A magistrate will decide later Tuesday whether Bennitt will be jailed pending trial. Since Leah's death, Fort Lewis has made changes to how it allows minors on post. Now, all minors must sign in at the Fort Lewis Visitor's Center, and could be denied access if staff members determine they have no legitimate reason for being at Fort Lewis. Security personnel have also increased random checks of entering vehicles, and there will be increased checks of barracks ''http://www.komonews.com/news/41041447.html'' \"It is the weak who are cruel.
