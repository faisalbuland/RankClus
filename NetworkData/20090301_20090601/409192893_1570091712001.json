        "content": "Do tax cuts stimulate the economy? \"I think when people take a look back at this moment in our economic history, they'll recognize tax cuts work. They have made a difference.\" -- George W. Bush The Historic Realities \u2022 Large income tax cuts are followed by a bubble and then a crash. \u2022 High income taxes correlate with economic growth. \u2022 Income tax increases are followed by economic growth. \u2022 Moderate income tax cuts are followed by a flat economy. \u2022 All of this is especially true as applied to the top tax rates, the amount paid on income that exceeds the highest bracket. The Three Great Tax Cuts: Boom, Bubble, Crash 1. Hoover During World War I, the top marginal tax rate went up to 73 percent -- not the highest ever, but pretty high. In 1922, a series of rate cuts began. Down to 56 percent, 46 percent, and finally, in 1925, it went down to 25 percent. The stock market took off. There was a boom. But the boom was a bubble. It was followed by the Great Crash of 1929. There were bank failures and the Great Depression. 2. Reagan From Franklin Roosevelt's second term all the way through to Jimmy Carter -- from 1936 until 1982 -- the top rate was in the 70 to 92 percent range. Then along came Reagan in 1981. In 1982, he cut that down to 50 percent. The economy was already in \"the worst recession since the Great Depression,\" a recession that was caused by the disastrous Carter years. However, in 1982 Reagan raised Social Security taxes, a tax that hit employers, employees and those receiving SS benefits, since for the first time ever, those benefits were taxed. Even with a 50% tax burden and new SS taxes, the country prospered. In 1986, there was another round of tax cuts. They took the top rate down to 38.5 percent. Then, in October 1987, there was a crash -- the worst since '29. It was called Black Monday. Much of the bubble money had gone into -- ohmigod! -- real estate. The rich used the extra money to make more money, using the newly deregulated Savings and Loan industry as a piggy bank. Suddenly there were bank failures! More than during the Great Depression. There was a Savings & Loan crisis! There had to be a bailout - the Reagan Administration nationalized part of the financial sector. Another recession hit in 1990. 3. Bush II George Bush came into office with the healthiest, most powerful economy in American history \u2013 one where taxes had been raised. A recession due to the dot com bubble hit in 2000. Bush immediately cut taxes. The top marginal rate went down from 39 percent to 35 percent. He also cut capital gains taxes and inheritance taxes. Eventually, the economy began to grow, but the economy never really got going for the middle class. Employment didn't grow very much. Median income went down. The stock market was pretty flat (10,500 Jan 2001 when Bush first took office 10,800 in Jan. 2005. But the financial sector -- and only the financial sector -- grew. OK the housing sector grew, but we now know that was due to shenanigans by the financial sector. Which should have made it obvious to someone, that it was \u2026 a bubble. There was a crash. Bank failures. A bailout. The Bush Administration nationalized part of the financial sector. The three worst economic disasters in American history follow the exact same pattern: tax cuts, boom, bubble, crash. High Taxes Correlate with Strong Economic Growth The four periods of greatest economic growth in American history, by pretty much any measure, are: \u2022 World War II (1941-45): top tax rate varied from 88 to 94 percent \u2022 Post-war under Truman and Eisenhower: top rate bounced around from 81 to 92 percent \u2022 Clinton years: Clinton raised Bush's top rate of 31 percent to 37 percent and then to 39 percent \u2022 First two Roosevelt administrations (1933-40). When Roosevelt came into office, Hoover had already raised the tax rate in 1932 from 25 percent to 63 percent. Roosevelt raised it again in 1936 to 79 percent. A lot of ink, sweat and ranting have gone into proving that the New Deal did not end the Great Depression. Nonetheless, the economy grew 58 percent from the time Roosevelt came into office and when the United States entered the war. Some of that anti-New Deal rhetoric also claims that the recovery began under Hoover. Perhaps, but to say so is also to say that it began with tax hikes. Likewise, many right-wing critics insist that the Clinton boom actually started under Bush the First. It is necessary to remember that Bush the First also raised taxes (from 28 percent to 31 percent). Tax Increases Are Followed by Economic Growth Three of the four high-growth periods cited above followed significant tax hikes. The fourth, the Truman-Eisenhower years, began with a top tax rate of 91 percent -- it couldn't get much higher. Moderate Tax Cuts Are Followed by Flat Growth John F. Kennedy is generally credited with starting the tax cut craze. He proposed it, but, as with most of his ideas, it was Lyndon Johnson who actually got it enacted. The top rate was cut from 91 percent to 77 percent, then to 70 percent, on all income over $200,000 for a single person and over $400,000 for a married couple. That's where it stayed, through Nixon, Ford and Carter. The Dow Jones average was pretty much the same when that period ended as when it began (860 in Jan 1968; 855 in Jan 1980.) Median personal income stayed roughly the same. These are the historic facts.",

        "content": "Do tax cuts stimulate the economy? \"I think when people take a look back at this moment in our economic history, they'll recognize tax cuts work. They have made a difference.\" -- George W. Bush The Historic Realities \u2022 Large income tax cuts are followed by a bubble and then a crash. \u2022 High income taxes correlate with economic growth. \u2022 Income tax increases are followed by economic growth. \u2022 Moderate income tax cuts are followed by a flat economy. \u2022 All of this is especially true as applied to the top tax rates, the amount paid on income that exceeds the highest bracket. The Three Great Tax Cuts: Boom, Bubble, Crash 1. Hoover During World War I, the top marginal tax rate went up to 73 percent -- not the highest ever, but pretty high. In 1922, a series of rate cuts began. Down to 56 percent, 46 percent, and finally, in 1925, it went down to 25 percent. The stock market took off. There was a boom. But the boom was a bubble. It was followed by the Great Crash of 1929. There were bank failures and the Great Depression. 2. Reagan From Franklin Roosevelt's second term all the way through to Jimmy Carter -- from 1936 until 1982 -- the top rate was in the 70 to 92 percent range. Then along came Reagan in 1981. In 1982, he cut that down to 50 percent. The economy was already in \"the worst recession since the Great Depression,\" a recession that was caused by the disastrous Carter years. However, in 1982 Reagan raised Social Security taxes, a tax that hit employers, employees and those receiving SS benefits, since for the first time ever, those benefits were taxed. Even with a 50% tax burden and new SS taxes, the country prospered. In 1986, there was another round of tax cuts. They took the top rate down to 38.5 percent. Then, in October 1987, there was a crash -- the worst since '29. It was called Black Monday. Much of the bubble money had gone into -- ohmigod! -- real estate. The rich used the extra money to make more money, using the newly deregulated Savings and Loan industry as a piggy bank. Suddenly there were bank failures! More than during the Great Depression. There was a Savings & Loan crisis! There had to be a bailout - the Reagan Administration nationalized part of the financial sector. Another recession hit in 1990. 3. Bush II George Bush came into office with the healthiest, most powerful economy in American history \u2013 one where taxes had been raised. A recession due to the dot com bubble hit in 2000. Bush immediately cut taxes. The top marginal rate went down from 39 percent to 35 percent. He also cut capital gains taxes and inheritance taxes. Eventually, the economy began to grow, but the economy never really got going for the middle class. Employment didn't grow very much. Median income went down. The stock market was pretty flat (10,500 Jan 2001 when Bush first took office 10,800 in Jan. 2005. But the financial sector -- and only the financial sector -- grew. OK the housing sector grew, but we now know that was due to shenanigans by the financial sector. Which should have made it obvious to someone, that it was \u2026 a bubble. There was a crash. Bank failures. A bailout. The Bush Administration nationalized part of the financial sector. The three worst economic disasters in American history follow the exact same pattern: tax cuts, boom, bubble, crash. High Taxes Correlate with Strong Economic Growth The four periods of greatest economic growth in American history, by pretty much any measure, are: \u2022 World War II (1941-45): top tax rate varied from 88 to 94 percent \u2022 Post-war under Truman and Eisenhower: top rate bounced around from 81 to 92 percent \u2022 Clinton years: Clinton raised Bush's top rate of 31 percent to 37 percent and then to 39 percent \u2022 First two Roosevelt administrations (1933-40). When Roosevelt came into office, Hoover had already raised the tax rate in 1932 from 25 percent to 63 percent. Roosevelt raised it again in 1936 to 79 percent. A lot of ink, sweat and ranting have gone into proving that the New Deal did not end the Great Depression. Nonetheless, the economy grew 58 percent from the time Roosevelt came into office and when the United States entered the war. Some of that anti-New Deal rhetoric also claims that the recovery began under Hoover. Perhaps, but to say so is also to say that it began with tax hikes. Likewise, many right-wing critics insist that the Clinton boom actually started under Bush the First. It is necessary to remember that Bush the First also raised taxes (from 28 percent to 31 percent). Tax Increases Are Followed by Economic Growth Three of the four high-growth periods cited above followed significant tax hikes. The fourth, the Truman-Eisenhower years, began with a top tax rate of 91 percent -- it couldn't get much higher. Moderate Tax Cuts Are Followed by Flat Growth John F. Kennedy is generally credited with starting the tax cut craze. He proposed it, but, as with most of his ideas, it was Lyndon Johnson who actually got it enacted. The top rate was cut from 91 percent to 77 percent, then to 70 percent, on all income over $200,000 for a single person and over $400,000 for a married couple. That's where it stayed, through Nixon, Ford and Carter. The Dow Jones average was pretty much the same when that period ended as when it began (860 in Jan 1968; 855 in Jan 1980.) Median personal income stayed roughly the same. These are the historic facts.",

        "content": "Do tax cuts stimulate the economy? \"I think when people take a look back at this moment in our economic history, they'll recognize tax cuts work. They have made a difference.\" -- George W. Bush The Historic Realities \u2022 Large income tax cuts are followed by a bubble and then a crash. \u2022 High income taxes correlate with economic growth. \u2022 Income tax increases are followed by economic growth. \u2022 Moderate income tax cuts are followed by a flat economy. \u2022 All of this is especially true as applied to the top tax rates, the amount paid on income that exceeds the highest bracket. The Three Great Tax Cuts: Boom, Bubble, Crash 1. Hoover During World War I, the top marginal tax rate went up to 73 percent -- not the highest ever, but pretty high. In 1922, a series of rate cuts began. Down to 56 percent, 46 percent, and finally, in 1925, it went down to 25 percent. The stock market took off. There was a boom. But the boom was a bubble. It was followed by the Great Crash of 1929. There were bank failures and the Great Depression. 2. Reagan From Franklin Roosevelt's second term all the way through to Jimmy Carter -- from 1936 until 1982 -- the top rate was in the 70 to 92 percent range. Then along came Reagan in 1981. In 1982, he cut that down to 50 percent. The economy was already in \"the worst recession since the Great Depression,\" a recession that was caused by the disastrous Carter years. However, in 1982 Reagan raised Social Security taxes, a tax that hit employers, employees and those receiving SS benefits, since for the first time ever, those benefits were taxed. Even with a 50% tax burden and new SS taxes, the country prospered. In 1986, there was another round of tax cuts. They took the top rate down to 38.5 percent. Then, in October 1987, there was a crash -- the worst since '29. It was called Black Monday. Much of the bubble money had gone into -- ohmigod! -- real estate. The rich used the extra money to make more money, using the newly deregulated Savings and Loan industry as a piggy bank. Suddenly there were bank failures! More than during the Great Depression. There was a Savings & Loan crisis! There had to be a bailout - the Reagan Administration nationalized part of the financial sector. Another recession hit in 1990. 3. Bush II George Bush came into office with the healthiest, most powerful economy in American history \u2013 one where taxes had been raised. A recession due to the dot com bubble hit in 2000. Bush immediately cut taxes. The top marginal rate went down from 39 percent to 35 percent. He also cut capital gains taxes and inheritance taxes. Eventually, the economy began to grow, but the economy never really got going for the middle class. Employment didn't grow very much. Median income went down. The stock market was pretty flat (10,500 Jan 2001 when Bush first took office 10,800 in Jan. 2005. But the financial sector -- and only the financial sector -- grew. OK the housing sector grew, but we now know that was due to shenanigans by the financial sector. Which should have made it obvious to someone, that it was \u2026 a bubble. There was a crash. Bank failures. A bailout. The Bush Administration nationalized part of the financial sector. The three worst economic disasters in American history follow the exact same pattern: tax cuts, boom, bubble, crash. High Taxes Correlate with Strong Economic Growth The four periods of greatest economic growth in American history, by pretty much any measure, are: \u2022 World War II (1941-45): top tax rate varied from 88 to 94 percent \u2022 Post-war under Truman and Eisenhower: top rate bounced around from 81 to 92 percent \u2022 Clinton years: Clinton raised Bush's top rate of 31 percent to 37 percent and then to 39 percent \u2022 First two Roosevelt administrations (1933-40). When Roosevelt came into office, Hoover had already raised the tax rate in 1932 from 25 percent to 63 percent. Roosevelt raised it again in 1936 to 79 percent. A lot of ink, sweat and ranting have gone into proving that the New Deal did not end the Great Depression. Nonetheless, the economy grew 58 percent from the time Roosevelt came into office and when the United States entered the war. Some of that anti-New Deal rhetoric also claims that the recovery began under Hoover. Perhaps, but to say so is also to say that it began with tax hikes. Likewise, many right-wing critics insist that the Clinton boom actually started under Bush the First. It is necessary to remember that Bush the First also raised taxes (from 28 percent to 31 percent). Tax Increases Are Followed by Economic Growth Three of the four high-growth periods cited above followed significant tax hikes. The fourth, the Truman-Eisenhower years, began with a top tax rate of 91 percent -- it couldn't get much higher. Moderate Tax Cuts Are Followed by Flat Growth John F. Kennedy is generally credited with starting the tax cut craze. He proposed it, but, as with most of his ideas, it was Lyndon Johnson who actually got it enacted. The top rate was cut from 91 percent to 77 percent, then to 70 percent, on all income over $200,000 for a single person and over $400,000 for a married couple. That's where it stayed, through Nixon, Ford and Carter. The Dow Jones average was pretty much the same when that period ended as when it began (860 in Jan 1968; 855 in Jan 1980.) Median personal income stayed roughly the same. These are the historic facts.",

I don't disagree with what you said, but an alternative would be less government spending, leave more with the State to do its own repairs and take care of their constituents and have them meet the needs of their voters. They are much easier to get out office if they're frivolous. Have a flat tax, in that way every consumer has an investment in the country and no one can point finger in either direction. Get rid of departments that slow and hinder growth. We have more Federal, State and Local personnel that produce nothing but are supported by tax payers. Although they too pay taxes we don't need to keep expanding that sector.",
