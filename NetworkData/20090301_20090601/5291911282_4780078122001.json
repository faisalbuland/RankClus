She finally called and said they needed to do something about it because it had just killed the neighbor's dog - - Well, that finally got them to show up, but they were still pretty skeptical. Because of the content of her call, the local TV station decided to tag along, so it was on the evening news. One of the officers/animal control people crawled down under the house, which was built on about 2 foot high pylons with slat skirting to keep critters out, but there was a large gap torn out.

But doesn't that same variable occur with a dog that may bite a child or a cat that may scratch one? Why allow cats and dogs that can just run out the door and run away and deny a caged animal? That's what I am not getting. If Elesso was applying for an apartment from me -- given, of course, that I was still in property management -- and I asked about pets, I would be inquiring about animals that could damage the unit or deface the common areas. A caged snake is no threat to the tenants, nor can it be destructive. I would simply tell him, within our contract, that they must remain caged. \"Any good snake is a dead snake\" is a misnomer. Snakes, like everything on this planet, are symbiotic to everything that survives and thrives here. And they do make good pets - I had a Kia Corn (Albino) that loved being on my neck and watched hockey with me. It got along with my dogs and basically ate mice, slept, and entertained the kids my children would bring home. Sure, she bit me a few times; but they were always my fault, such as handling her when she was hungry or had just eaten. My Kia: It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening.

Snakes, like everything on this planet, are symbiotic to everything that survives and thrives here.

It got along with my dogs and basically ate mice, slept, and entertained the kids my children would bring home. Sure, she bit me a few times; but they were always my fault, such as handling her when she was hungry or had just eaten. I'm always amazed at people that feel they have to kill any snake they come across. Actually not only snakes but all sorts of critters. When I lived in upstate NY I had several skunks and a fox that I fed at my back door. I had to keep it secret because if my neighbors found out there were skunks and a fox around they would have hunted them down and killed them. Ignorance is bliss? I went fishing with my then-wife and kids one time, when my middle daughter, Tonia, came-a-runnin' and yelling that she found a snake. I grabbed my camera and went to snap a picture of it, only to be horrified that someone (not my kids) had bashed it with a big rock right in the middle - it could move its head, but nothing below about half-way down. I sent the kiddos and Camy away and finished the deed so it wouldn't suffer any more. It was a pure black rat snake, maybe 3 or 4 feet long. It couldn't hurt you if you wanted it to. Needless to say, surrounding it was a bunch of litter (trash) mostly consisting of beer cans. I put a knife through its head and threw it in the river to feed the fish, and had my kids come back to that spot and clean up the mess left by the drunks. They asked me where the snake was, and I was honest in telling them that it was suffering and I had to kill it so it wouldn't die an agonizing death. But that we needed to clean the area so other wildlife could enjoy it. I think they learned something that day - I hope they did, anyway. Troy, Camy's boy, asked me why anyone would do such a thing. I had no answer for him sans to state that some people are bullies and pick on things smaller than them to make them feel tough. He concurred and said it was like the bullies at his school that targeted the smallest kids to pick on. So I know that at least he got it. We cleaned up the area, all of us (took us 3 full trash bags, IIRC). I hope that the jerks who did that to the snake and left it to suffer drowned in the river. Seriously, people pizz me off. Anyone controlled by fear is not in control of themselves. I fear for what my kids have to grow up surrounded by. But torturing an innocent animal? Man, that is the cruelest brutality of vanity I have ever witnessed. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

Finding themselves in close proximity with \"joe no-shoulders\" while working in a field, walking a path to the out-house, or some other circumstance, created a certain sense of instant panic and immediate reaction that meant only one thing - survival. They had cats to get rid of vermin, so the snake any snake, had to go, for the sake of the safety of the family. Here are three typical stories to illustrate their fears and reasons: Dad was a cowboy in the 1920s. Automobiles were not even in use in southern Utah yet. He was riding along in a gully looking for stray cattle. The bank of the gully was about 3 or 4 feet high. He felt something brushing back and forth on his boot, looked down, and a large rattler was hanging by its fangs from his pant-leg, it venom trickling down the side of his boot. He reached down quickly and threw it off, then emptied his .44 pistol into it. He also had a Bulldog called \"Mugsie\" which often tangled with rattlers. It would circle the snake until the reptile would try to crawl away, then it would dive in an shake the serpent to pieces. They kept the dog around the younger children to protect them from snakes, and it was bit several times, often getting very sick. Eventually, it died from a bite. They often turned pigs loose, because pigs would eat snakes. Then the ranchers would hunt and eat the pigs - so it went. Snakes are somewhat scare there now... Mom tells a story of going outside to check on my older sisters at play and found the oldest sister, about 4 at the time, sitting on the ground watching a rattler that was coiled not too far away. The ever-present irrigation shovel went into full gear! I have had several very close calls with rattlers. One came up behind me out of a beaver lodge I was standing on while fishing, and started buzzing - thank goodness. I had to jump in the water to get away from it. Friends with me killed it... I have killed numerous rattlers, but I have saved a few too. The reason? One I killed on the desert had three mice inside when I skinned it... A time later, I saw a very large one slowly crossing a well-traveled dirt road out in the desert, so I decided to stop, get out my walking stick, pick it up, and get it to the bushes on the side. It buzzed angrily at me through the whole process, but never struck. Just as I finished, a huge truck came through which would certainly have run over it - - As I get much older, I am less comfortable with taking the life of almost anything, because anything trying to survive these days probably has the right to go on trying - - Here is a poem I wrote a long, long time ago - - 13 March 82 - - - -The End of March - - - - I walked along and looked down, And he looked back at me; He used his comical yellow eye, And he rustled the grass As he went down the bank. Then he stopped at the water\u2019s edge; His head turned \u2018round, And he said to me - - \u201cYou were young once. Your eyes were bright one time.\u201d I heard his small whispering voice Coming up to me from that Flickering tongue, those tight lips; And I went down to talk to him. But he only laughed And smiled a shiny, plated smile. I picked him up in my hand, But he had said his say. His yellow eye mocked me; Like a mean little boy, He stuck his tongue out at me - - I smiled and dropped him Into the creek as I would have Any mischievous friend, And he swam quickly away.

Well, I do understand that certain snakes can be a danger, such as Water Moccasins. But, honestly, where is the harm in a renter having a snake in a cage? There is a chance of it escaping, sure. But doesn't that same variable occur with a dog that may bite a child or a cat that may scratch one? Why allow cats and dogs that can just run out the door and run away and deny a caged animal? That's what I am not getting. If Elesso was applying for an apartment from me -- given, of course, that I was still in property management -- and I asked about pets, I would be inquiring about animals that could damage the unit or deface the common areas. A caged snake is no threat to the tenants, nor can it be destructive. I would simply tell him, within our contract, that they must remain caged. \"Any good snake is a dead snake\" is a misnomer. Snakes, like everything on this planet, are symbiotic to everything that survives and thrives here. And they do make good pets - I had a Kia Corn (Albino) that loved being on my neck and watched hockey with me. It got along with my dogs and basically ate mice, slept, and entertained the kids my children would bring home. Sure, she bit me a few times; but they were always my fault, such as handling her when she was hungry or had just eaten. My Kia: It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening.

I went fishing with my then-wife and kids one time, when my middle daughter, Tonia, came-a-runnin' and yelling that she found a snake. I grabbed my camera and went to snap a picture of it, only to be horrified that someone (not my kids) had bashed it with a big rock right in the middle - it could move its head, but nothing below about half-way down. I sent the kiddos and Camy away and finished the deed so it wouldn't suffer any more. It was a pure black rat snake, maybe 3 or 4 feet long. It couldn't hurt you if you wanted it to. Needless to say, surrounding it was a bunch of litter (trash) mostly consisting of beer cans. I put a knife through its head and threw it in the river to feed the fish, and had my kids come back to that spot and clean up the mess left by the drunks. They asked me where the snake was, and I was honest in telling them that it was suffering and I had to kill it so it wouldn't die an agonizing death. But that we needed to clean the area so other wildlife could enjoy it. I think they learned something that day - I hope they did, anyway. Troy, Camy's boy, asked me why anyone would do such a thing. I had no answer for him sans to state that some people are bullies and pick on things smaller than them to make them feel tough. He concurred and said it was like the bullies at his school that targeted the smallest kids to pick on. So I know that at least he got it. We cleaned up the area, all of us (took us 3 full trash bags, IIRC). I hope that the jerks who did that to the snake and left it to suffer drowned in the river. Seriously, people pizz me off. Anyone controlled by fear is not in control of themselves. I fear for what my kids have to grow up surrounded by. But torturing an innocent animal? Man, that is the cruelest brutality of vanity I have ever witnessed. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

He concurred and said it was like the bullies at his school that targeted the smallest kids to pick on. So I know that at least he got it. We cleaned up the area, all of us (took us 3 full trash bags, IIRC). I hope that the jerks who did that to the snake and left it to suffer drowned in the river. Seriously, people pizz me off. Anyone controlled by fear is not in control of themselves. I fear for what my kids have to grow up surrounded by. But torturing an innocent animal? Man, that is the cruelest brutality of vanity I have ever witnessed. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

They were raised in times and under conditions where the territory of the Wild and the territory of the Civilized was still in dispute. Stories of snakes - both dangerous and maybe not - coming into rude 1920s homes through cracks in walls or up through knot holes in the flooring, causing shock, fright, and terror are pretty common in their lore. Finding themselves in close proximity with \"joe no-shoulders\" while working in a field, walking a path to the out-house, or some other circumstance, created a certain sense of instant panic and immediate reaction that meant only one thing - survival. They had cats to get rid of vermin, so the snake any snake, had to go, for the sake of the safety of the family. Here are three typical stories to illustrate their fears and reasons: Dad was a cowboy in the 1920s. Automobiles were not even in use in southern Utah yet. He was riding along in a gully looking for stray cattle. The bank of the gully was about 3 or 4 feet high. He felt something brushing back and forth on his boot, looked down, and a large rattler was hanging by its fangs from his pant-leg, it venom trickling down the side of his boot. He reached down quickly and threw it off, then emptied his .44 pistol into it. He also had a Bulldog called \"Mugsie\" which often tangled with rattlers. It would circle the snake until the reptile would try to crawl away, then it would dive in an shake the serpent to pieces. They kept the dog around the younger children to protect them from snakes, and it was bit several times, often getting very sick. Eventually, it died from a bite. They often turned pigs loose, because pigs would eat snakes. Then the ranchers would hunt and eat the pigs - so it went. Snakes are somewhat scare there now... Mom tells a story of going outside to check on my older sisters at play and found the oldest sister, about 4 at the time, sitting on the ground watching a rattler that was coiled not too far away. The ever-present irrigation shovel went into full gear! I have had several very close calls with rattlers. One came up behind me out of a beaver lodge I was standing on while fishing, and started buzzing - thank goodness. I had to jump in the water to get away from it. Friends with me killed it... I have killed numerous rattlers, but I have saved a few too. The reason? One I killed on the desert had three mice inside when I skinned it... A time later, I saw a very large one slowly crossing a well-traveled dirt road out in the desert, so I decided to stop, get out my walking stick, pick it up, and get it to the bushes on the side. It buzzed angrily at me through the whole process, but never struck. Just as I finished, a huge truck came through which would certainly have run over it - - As I get much older, I am less comfortable with taking the life of almost anything, because anything trying to survive these days probably has the right to go on trying - - Here is a poem I wrote a long, long time ago - - 13 March 82 - - - -The End of March - - - - I walked along and looked down, And he looked back at me; He used his comical yellow eye, And he rustled the grass As he went down the bank. Then he stopped at the water\u2019s edge; His head turned \u2018round, And he said to me - - \u201cYou were young once. Your eyes were bright one time.\u201d I heard his small whispering voice Coming up to me from that Flickering tongue, those tight lips; And I went down to talk to him. But he only laughed And smiled a shiny, plated smile. I picked him up in my hand, But he had said his say. His yellow eye mocked me; Like a mean little boy, He stuck his tongue out at me - - I smiled and dropped him Into the creek as I would have Any mischievous friend, And he swam quickly away.
