Obama's team expects little help from Republicans in passing his massive budget blueprint for the year that begins Oct. 1. On Tuesday, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the plan has three \"fatal flaws:\" it spends, taxes and borrows too much. More troubling for Obama are the arrows coming from congressional Democrats. They generally support his plans to revamp health care, education and energy policies. But prominent Democrats oppose several of his proposals for targeted tax hikes and spending cuts to pay for the changes. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said numerous colleagues have cited objections and told him, \"If this is in, don't count on my vote.\" It has happened so often, Conrad told White House budget director Peter Orszag at a hearing Tuesday, that everyone can \"absolutely be sure we can't pass this budget.\" Conrad himself is part of Obama's problem. He is among those who oppose the president's bid to eliminate subsidies to farms with more than $500,000 in annual sales. There is no need to revisit the farm bill approved last year, Conrad said. Also unpopular with many Democratic lawmakers is the president's proposal to reduce the tax deductibility of mortgage payments and charitable gifts by households making more than $250,000 a year. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said he worries there would be fewer donations to groups that help the needy \"during a time of crisis.\" The White House has cited studies suggesting the drop would be tiny, but Rangel said he wants more information. Obama also may face hurdles in trying to impose higher premium payments for upper-income retirees receiving Medicare drug benefits. Senate Democrats killed such an effort two years ago. They are taking a wait-and-see approach to the president's plan. <more> \"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i-MWenrWA5IMyM0Xl-QlJOgQcVJAD96RDNB80\" Paglia @ Salon: \"Heads should roll\" quote: Yes, free the president from his flacks, fixers and goons -- his posse of smirky smart alecks and provincial rubes, who were shrewd enough to beat the slow, pompous Clintons in the mano-a-mano primaries but who seem like dazed lost lambs in the brave new world of federal legislation and global statesmanship.

Obama's team expects little help from Republicans in passing his massive budget blueprint for the year that begins Oct. 1. On Tuesday, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the plan has three \"fatal flaws:\" it spends, taxes and borrows too much. More troubling for Obama are the arrows coming from congressional Democrats. They generally support his plans to revamp health care, education and energy policies. But prominent Democrats oppose several of his proposals for targeted tax hikes and spending cuts to pay for the changes. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said numerous colleagues have cited objections and told him, \"If this is in, don't count on my vote.\" It has happened so often, Conrad told White House budget director Peter Orszag at a hearing Tuesday, that everyone can \"absolutely be sure we can't pass this budget.\" Conrad himself is part of Obama's problem. He is among those who oppose the president's bid to eliminate subsidies to farms with more than $500,000 in annual sales. There is no need to revisit the farm bill approved last year, Conrad said. Also unpopular with many Democratic lawmakers is the president's proposal to reduce the tax deductibility of mortgage payments and charitable gifts by households making more than $250,000 a year. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said he worries there would be fewer donations to groups that help the needy \"during a time of crisis.\" The White House has cited studies suggesting the drop would be tiny, but Rangel said he wants more information. Obama also may face hurdles in trying to impose higher premium payments for upper-income retirees receiving Medicare drug benefits. Senate Democrats killed such an effort two years ago.
