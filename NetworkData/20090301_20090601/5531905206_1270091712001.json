What are your thoughts? _________________________________________________________________ Subject: I'm Tired, by Robert Hall I'm TiredI\u2019ll be 63 soon. Except for one semester in college when jobs were scarce, and a six-month period when I was between jobs, but job-hunting every day, I\u2019ve worked, hard, since I was 18. Despite some health challenges, I still put in 50-hour weeks, and haven\u2019t called in sick in seven or eight years. I make a good salary, but I didn\u2019t inherit my job or my income, and I worked to get where I am. Given the economy, there\u2019s no retirement in sight, and I\u2019m tired. Very tired. I\u2019m tired of being told that I have to \u201cspread the wealth around\u201d to people who don\u2019t have my work ethic. I\u2019m tired of being told the government will take the money I earned, by force if necessary, and give it to people too lazy or stupid to earn it. I\u2019m tired of being told that I have to pay more taxes to \u201ckeep people in their homes.\u201d Sure, if they lost their jobs or got sick, I\u2019m willing to help. But if they bought McMansions at three times the price of our paid-off, $250,000 condo, on one-third of my salary, then let the leftwing Congress critters who passed Fannie and Freddie and the Community Reinvestment Act that created the bubble help them\u2014with their own money. I\u2019m tired of being told how bad America is by leftwing millionaires like Michael Moore, George Soros and Hollywood entertainers who live in luxury because of the opportunities America offers. In thirty years, if they get their way, the United States will have the religious freedom and women\u2019s rights of Saudi Arabia, the economy of Zimbabwe, the freedom of the press of China, the crime and violence of Mexico, the tolerance for Gay people of Iran, and the freedom of speech of Venezuela. Won\u2019t multiculturalism be beautiful? I\u2019m tired of being told that Islam is a \u201cReligion of Peace,\u201d when every day I can read dozens of stories of Muslim men killing their sisters, wives and daughters for their family \u201chonor;\u201d of Muslims rioting over some slight offense; of Muslims murdering Christian and Jews because they aren\u2019t \u201cbelievers;\u201d of Muslims burning schools for girls; of Muslims stoning teenage rape victims to death for adultery;\u201d of Muslims mutilating the genitals of little girls; all in the name of Allah, because the Qur\u2019an and Shari\u2019a law tells them to. I believe \u201ca man should be judged by the content of his character, not by the color of his skin.\u201d I\u2019m tired of being told that \u201crace doesn\u2019t matter\u201d in the post-racial world of President Obama, when it\u2019s all that matters in affirmative action jobs, lower college admission and graduation standards for minorities (harming them the most), government contract set-asides, tolerance for the ghetto culture of violence and fatherless children that hurts minorities more than anyone, and in the appointment of US Senators from Illinois. I think it\u2019s very cool that we have a black president and that a black child is doing her homework at the desk where Lincoln wrote the emancipation proclamation. I just wish the black president was Condi Rice, or someone who believes more in freedom and the individual and less in an all-knowing government. I\u2019m tired of a news media that thinks Bush\u2019s fundraising and inaugural expenses were obscene, but that think Obama\u2019s, at triple the cost, were wonderful. That thinks Bush exercising daily was a waste of presidential time, but Obama exercising is a great example for the public to control weight and stress, that picked over every line of Bush\u2019s military records, but never demanded that Kerry release his, that slammed Palin with two years as governor for being too inexperienced for VP, but touted Obama with three years as senator as potentially the best president ever. Wonder why people are dropping their subscriptions or switching to Fox News? Get a clue. I didn\u2019t vote for Bush in 2000, but the media and Kerry drove me to his camp in 2004. I\u2019m tired of being told that out of \u201ctolerance for other cultures\u201d we must let Saudi Arabia use our oil money to fund mosques and madrassa Islamic schools to preach hate in America, while no American group is allowed to fund a church, synagogue or religious school in Saudi Arabia to teach love and tolerance. I\u2019m tired of being told I must lower my living standard to fight global warming, which no one is allowed to debate. My wife and I live in a two-bedroom apartment and carpool together five miles to our jobs. We also own a three-bedroom condo where our daughter and granddaughter live. Our carbon footprint is about 5% of Al Gore\u2019s, and if you\u2019re greener than Gore, you\u2019re green enough. I\u2019m tired of being told that drug addicts have a disease, and I must help support and treat them, and pay for the damage they do. Did a giant germ rush out of a dark alley, grab them, and stuff white powder up their noses while they tried to fight it off? I don\u2019t think Gay people choose to be Gay, but I damn sure think druggies chose to take drugs. And I\u2019m tired of harassment from cool people treating me like a freak when I tell them I never tried marijuana. I\u2019m tired of illegal aliens being called \u201cundocumented workers,\u201d especially the ones who aren\u2019t working, but are living on welfare or crime. What\u2019s next? Calling drug dealers, \u201cUndocumented Pharmacists\u201d? And, no, I\u2019m not against Hispanics. Most of them are Catholic and it\u2019s been a few hundred years since Catholics wanted to kill me for my religion. I\u2019m willing to fast track for citizenship any Hispanic person who can speak English, doesn\u2019t have a criminal record and who is self-supporting without family on welfare, or who serves honorably for three years in our military. Those are the citizens we need. I\u2019m tired of latte liberals and journalists, who would never wear the uniform of the Republic themselves, or let their entitlement-handicapped kids near a recruiting station, trashing our military. They and their kids can sit at home, never having to make split-second decisions under life and death circumstances, and bad mouth better people then themselves. Do bad things happen in war? You bet. Do our troops sometimes misbehave? Sure. Does this compare with the atrocities that were the policy of our enemies for the last fifty years\u2014and still are? Not even close. So here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019ll let myself be subjected to all the humiliation and abuse that was heaped on terrorists at Abu Ghraib or Gitmo, and the critics can let themselves be subject to captivity by the Muslims who tortured and beheaded Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, or the Muslims who tortured and murdered Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon, or the Muslims who ran the blood-spattered Al Qaeda torture rooms our troops found in Iraq, or the Muslims who cut off the heads of schoolgirls in Indonesia, because the girls were Christian. Then we\u2019ll compare notes. British and American soldiers are the only troops in history that civilians came to for help and handouts, instead of hiding from in fear. I\u2019m tired of people telling me that their party has a corner on virtue and the other party has a corner on corruption. Read the papers\u2014bums are bi-partisan. And I\u2019m tired of people telling me we need bi-partisanship. I live in Illinois, where the \u201cIllinois Combine\u201d of Democrats and Republicans has worked together harmoniously to loot the public for years. And I notice that the tax cheats in Obama\u2019s cabinet are bi-partisan as well. I\u2019m tired of hearing wealthy athletes, entertainers and politicians of both parties talking about innocent mistakes, stupid mistakes or youthful mistakes, when we all know they think their only mistake was getting caught. I\u2019m tired of people with a sense of entitlement, rich or poor. Speaking of poor, I\u2019m tired of hearing people with air-conditioned homes, color TVs and two cars called poor. The majority of Americans didn\u2019t have that in 1970, but we didn\u2019t know we were \u201cpoor.\u201d The poverty pimps have to keep changing the definition of poor to keep the dollars flowing. I\u2019m real tired of people who don\u2019t take responsibility for their lives and actions. I\u2019m tired of hearing them blame the government, or discrimination, or big-whatever for their problems. Yes, I\u2019m damn tired. But I\u2019m also glad to be 63. Because, mostly, I\u2019m not going to get to see the world these people are making. I\u2019m just sorry for my granddaughter. Robert A.

I'm tired of my money being spent to educate children. Let the parents pay. I'm tired of my money being spent on pork projects to maintain an infrastructure. I'm tired of my money being spent to keep banks functioning (except my bank of course - Let's keep our eye on the eightball here) I'm tired of subsidies to mass transit - What's wrong with walking? I'm tired of Christian terrorists who defacto have made abortion illegal in most states by bombing abortion clinics and killing doctors. I'm tired of hearing about useless parasites who pull down millions while they run their companies into the ground, and their hard working employees starve. But most of all I'm tired of living in a modern country, and thanks be, that if the author of this essay had his way, we would all be living in wonderful caves, eating the neighbors for our daily meat. And actually I'm tired of all these useless sterotypes presented as Fact. If you can find one person who cheats to get food stamps, that proves that the other thirty million people are also cheating - I have to pause and give special note to the following statement - It simply turns me on so much... quote: I\u2019m tired of being told that out of \u201ctolerance for other cultures\u201d we must let Saudi Arabia use our oil money to fund mosques and madrassa Islamic schools to preach hate in America, while no American group is allowed to fund a church, synagogue or religious school in Saudi Arabia to teach love and tolerance. Must be leftists who support the Saudi's... Dave",

I make a good salary, but I didn\u2019t inherit my job or my income, and I worked to get where I am. Given the economy, there\u2019s no retirement in sight, and I\u2019m tired. Very tired. I\u2019m tired of being told that I have to \u201cspread the wealth around\u201d to people who don\u2019t have my work ethic. I\u2019m tired of being told the government will take the money I earned, by force if necessary, and give it to people too lazy or stupid to earn it. I\u2019m tired of being told that I have to pay more taxes to \u201ckeep people in their homes.\u201d Sure, if they lost their jobs or got sick, I\u2019m willing to help. But if they bought McMansions at three times the price of our paid-off, $250,000 condo, on one-third of my salary, then let the leftwing Congress critters who passed Fannie and Freddie and the Community Reinvestment Act that created the bubble help them\u2014with their own money. I\u2019m tired of being told how bad America is by leftwing millionaires like Michael Moore, George Soros and Hollywood entertainers who live in luxury because of the opportunities America offers. In thirty years, if they get their way, the United States will have the religious freedom and women\u2019s rights of Saudi Arabia, the economy of Zimbabwe, the freedom of the press of China, the crime and violence of Mexico, the tolerance for Gay people of Iran, and the freedom of speech of Venezuela. Won\u2019t multiculturalism be beautiful? I\u2019m tired of being told that Islam is a \u201cReligion of Peace,\u201d when every day I can read dozens of stories of Muslim men killing their sisters, wives and daughters for their family \u201chonor;\u201d of Muslims rioting over some slight offense; of Muslims murdering Christian and Jews because they aren\u2019t \u201cbelievers;\u201d of Muslims burning schools for girls; of Muslims stoning teenage rape victims to death for adultery;\u201d of Muslims mutilating the genitals of little girls; all in the name of Allah, because the Qur\u2019an and Shari\u2019a law tells them to. I believe \u201ca man should be judged by the content of his character, not by the color of his skin.\u201d I\u2019m tired of being told that \u201crace doesn\u2019t matter\u201d in the post-racial world of President Obama, when it\u2019s all that matters in affirmative action jobs, lower college admission and graduation standards for minorities (harming them the most), government contract set-asides, tolerance for the ghetto culture of violence and fatherless children that hurts minorities more than anyone, and in the appointment of US Senators from Illinois. I think it\u2019s very cool that we have a black president and that a black child is doing her homework at the desk where Lincoln wrote the emancipation proclamation. I just wish the black president was Condi Rice, or someone who believes more in freedom and the individual and less in an all-knowing government. I\u2019m tired of a news media that thinks Bush\u2019s fundraising and inaugural expenses were obscene, but that think Obama\u2019s, at triple the cost, were wonderful. That thinks Bush exercising daily was a waste of presidential time, but Obama exercising is a great example for the public to control weight and stress, that picked over every line of Bush\u2019s military records, but never demanded that Kerry release his, that slammed Palin with two years as governor for being too inexperienced for VP, but touted Obama with three years as senator as potentially the best president ever. Wonder why people are dropping their subscriptions or switching to Fox News? Get a clue. I didn\u2019t vote for Bush in 2000, but the media and Kerry drove me to his camp in 2004. I\u2019m tired of being told that out of \u201ctolerance for other cultures\u201d we must let Saudi Arabia use our oil money to fund mosques and madrassa Islamic schools to preach hate in America, while no American group is allowed to fund a church, synagogue or religious school in Saudi Arabia to teach love and tolerance. I\u2019m tired of being told I must lower my living standard to fight global warming, which no one is allowed to debate. My wife and I live in a two-bedroom apartment and carpool together five miles to our jobs. We also own a three-bedroom condo where our daughter and granddaughter live. Our carbon footprint is about 5% of Al Gore\u2019s, and if you\u2019re greener than Gore, you\u2019re green enough. I\u2019m tired of being told that drug addicts have a disease, and I must help support and treat them, and pay for the damage they do. Did a giant germ rush out of a dark alley, grab them, and stuff white powder up their noses while they tried to fight it off? I don\u2019t think Gay people choose to be Gay, but I damn sure think druggies chose to take drugs. And I\u2019m tired of harassment from cool people treating me like a freak when I tell them I never tried marijuana. I\u2019m tired of illegal aliens being called \u201cundocumented workers,\u201d especially the ones who aren\u2019t working, but are living on welfare or crime. What\u2019s next? Calling drug dealers, \u201cUndocumented Pharmacists\u201d? And, no, I\u2019m not against Hispanics. Most of them are Catholic and it\u2019s been a few hundred years since Catholics wanted to kill me for my religion. I\u2019m willing to fast track for citizenship any Hispanic person who can speak English, doesn\u2019t have a criminal record and who is self-supporting without family on welfare, or who serves honorably for three years in our military. Those are the citizens we need. I\u2019m tired of latte liberals and journalists, who would never wear the uniform of the Republic themselves, or let their entitlement-handicapped kids near a recruiting station, trashing our military. They and their kids can sit at home, never having to make split-second decisions under life and death circumstances, and bad mouth better people then themselves. Do bad things happen in war? You bet. Do our troops sometimes misbehave? Sure. Does this compare with the atrocities that were the policy of our enemies for the last fifty years\u2014and still are? Not even close. So here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019ll let myself be subjected to all the humiliation and abuse that was heaped on terrorists at Abu Ghraib or Gitmo, and the critics can let themselves be subject to captivity by the Muslims who tortured and beheaded Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, or the Muslims who tortured and murdered Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon, or the Muslims who ran the blood-spattered Al Qaeda torture rooms our troops found in Iraq, or the Muslims who cut off the heads of schoolgirls in Indonesia, because the girls were Christian. Then we\u2019ll compare notes. British and American soldiers are the only troops in history that civilians came to for help and handouts, instead of hiding from in fear. I\u2019m tired of people telling me that their party has a corner on virtue and the other party has a corner on corruption. Read the papers\u2014bums are bi-partisan. And I\u2019m tired of people telling me we need bi-partisanship. I live in Illinois, where the \u201cIllinois Combine\u201d of Democrats and Republicans has worked together harmoniously to loot the public for years. And I notice that the tax cheats in Obama\u2019s cabinet are bi-partisan as well. I\u2019m tired of hearing wealthy athletes, entertainers and politicians of both parties talking about innocent mistakes, stupid mistakes or youthful mistakes, when we all know they think their only mistake was getting caught. I\u2019m tired of people with a sense of entitlement, rich or poor. Speaking of poor, I\u2019m tired of hearing people with air-conditioned homes, color TVs and two cars called poor. The majority of Americans didn\u2019t have that in 1970, but we didn\u2019t know we were \u201cpoor.\u201d The poverty pimps have to keep changing the definition of poor to keep the dollars flowing. I\u2019m real tired of people who don\u2019t take responsibility for their lives and actions. I\u2019m tired of hearing them blame the government, or discrimination, or big-whatever for their problems. Yes, I\u2019m damn tired. But I\u2019m also glad to be 63. Because, mostly, I\u2019m not going to get to see the world these people are making. I\u2019m just sorry for my granddaughter. Robert A.

It wasn't till I went to the part of the house where the breaker panel was that I smelled the smoke and realized what was happening. Ten garden hoses would have put that fire out. there were three pumpers there and they were open for business. Even so we saved very little. I think that you also need to consider the contributions to fire prevention and education fire departments provide. I'm tired of my money being spent to educate children. Let the parents pay. A well educated populous helps all of us. They're less likely to end up on the welfare rolls; they earn more money and pay more taxes. I'm tired of my money being spent on pork projects to maintain an infrastructure. I'm tired of my money being spent to keep banks functioning (except my bank of course - Let's keep our eye on the eightball here) Uh-huh I'm tired of subsidies to mass transit - What's wrong with walking? Let's suppose you live twenty miles from where you work. Would you like to walk 40 miles five days a week and how long would it take? Mass transit is good in a number of ways. It offers people who might not be able to afford their own car options like where to work or shop. Mass transit reduces harmful emissions. Mass transit reduces gridlock on our highways. I was raised in a area that had great mass transit. I always owned a car but rarely drove it. Most of the places I went to were accessible by bus and or subway and I never had to look for a place to park. On the rare occasions that the bus or subway didn't go to where I needed to go I'd drive myself. I'm tired of Christian terrorists who defacto have made abortion illegal in most states by bombing abortion clinics and killing doctors. I am too! I'm tired of hearing about useless parasites who pull down millions while they run their companies into the ground, and their hard working employees starve. You got that right! But most of all I'm tired of living in a modern country, and thanks be, that if the author of this essay had his way, we would all be living in wonderful caves, eating the neighbors for our daily meat. Big Grin And actually I'm tired of all these useless sterotypes presented as Fact. If you can find one person who cheats to get food stamps, that proves that the other thirty million people are also cheating",

I think you need to rethink that one.[/QUOTE] Your arguments are beyond refutation. You've torn up my points and made a fool of me... I stand corrected. Dave",
