I read the Posting guidelines with the ToS and see very vile posts every day about the Former President & Vice President. That particular thread' Original Poster now is calling for the Former President, His father (Bush 41) & Deceased Grandfather to be arrested. Seems to fit this sites 6(i)guidelines decriptions of libelous, slanderous, defaming, disruptive, etc. As for a Vacation or Banning/IP Ban, thats up to all of you on the Mod staff. Considering my only Suspensions ever were total BS from Dmulher who had personal beefs with me. Most of you are fair, I accept whatever happens.",
