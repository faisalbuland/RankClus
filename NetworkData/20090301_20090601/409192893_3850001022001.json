It is funny that you liberals and conservatives are always bickering back and forth as if either of you guys really offer anything in the form of \"change\". Change would have to constitute something new, something different. What is new or different about the two parties in our 100 year old 2 party system? I always said that Bush was not a conservative, and I was right. He was a neoconservative. Liberals and neocons love to do all of the same things; spend money like an idiot, mettle with the affairs of other sovereign nations, take more power from the people that they govern, etc. The only real difference between and Liberal and a Neocon is that Neocons believe in tax cuts. But, everything else is the same. That would explain why Obama is expanding upon the Bush agenda. Obama is just a Neocon that doesn't lower taxes.
