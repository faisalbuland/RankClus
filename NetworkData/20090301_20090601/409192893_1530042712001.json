You are going to need to go back farther than 8 years to see fiscal responsibility (and the last president to display that trait was a democrat, not a republican). You must remember that it is Congress that is in charge of the money and spending. And, it was a Republican Congress that was in charge during the Clinton years. That was actually one of the only Republican Congresses that I agreed with. They kept the budget, deficit and Clinton in check in regard to budgetary concerns. But, the Congress under Bush turned into a nightmare (probably due to Clinton's impeachment and Newt Gingrich's resignation a few years earlier). But, this Democratic Congress is not much different other than they are spending far more.

There hasn't been anything conservative about that party in at least 8 years. And, that is probably why they are in disarray. They've lost their platform. When Bush campaigned on a conservative platform, he won. McCain campaigned on a moderate platform and lost. Most Republicans that I talk to aren't very conservative. That is especially true not only in their politics, but more so in their personal lives. Sure, they believe in a creator, they believe in low taxes, etc. But, take one look at their personal finances and you will see that the cornerstone of conservatism, fiscal responsibility, is not to be found. You are going to need to go back farther than 8 years to see fiscal responsibility (and the last president to display that trait was a democrat, not a republican).", 
        "reply": " You must remember that it is Congress that is in charge of the money and spending. And, it was a Republican Congress that was in charge during the Clinton years. That was actually one of the only Republican Congresses that I agreed with. They kept the budget, deficit and Clinton in check in regard to budgetary concerns. But, the Congress under Bush turned into a nightmare (probably due to Clinton's impeachment and Newt Gingrich's resignation a few years earlier). But, this Democratic Congress is not much different other than they are spending far more.

The Republicans were long branded as the conservative party and fought the good fight for a while, but they wore out and we saw the evidence of that during the last election. The Republicans were both right and wrong, depending upon historical circumstances. They were right to assert that all men are created equal during the dark and bloody years of our Civil War, but they reneged on that by insisting on isolationism in the years leading up to WWII. 1964 was a watershed year for the Republicans both philosophically and politically. The Republican standard-bearer was Arizona governor Barry Goldwater, a principled man of highly impeccable conservative standards. But historically we were not ready for such a man or his message at that time. One must keep in mind that by the mid 1960s the civil rights movement was reaching a critical tipping point--the majority of Americans were ready to reject the decades-old framework of Jim Crow and integrate black Americans into general society. The question was how would this be done? Harry Truman, a Democrat, took the first step by integrating the armed forces in 1949. In 1950 a black American could command a company of soldiers in places like Korea but could not go and sit with those soldiers for dinner in places like Richmond. This was insanity, and most Americans recognized it as such. By 1964 it was clear that Jim Crow segregation was no longer viable and that black Americans needed to be given entry to all aspects of American life. LBJ sought to do just that through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Not so fast, said Goldwater--this is not the responsibility of the federal government but of the states. Goldwater was technically right but at the time politically wrong--he went down in defeat and was tarred by association with all kinds of kooks from Birchers to Klansmen, never mind that the latter were overwhelmingly Democratic. The 1960s and 1970s were the \"wilderness years\" for the GOP, and this was for good reason. When Moses led the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage he faced a generational period--forty years--of wandering in a hostile wilderness and learning to survive in that wilderness. The Israelites had to learn, by necessity, to stop being slaves and to live or die by their own means. The Republicans had their Moses too, but it's unclear who that Moses was. In strictly political terms it seems that Moses was Richard Nixon, the man who coopted Southern Democrats and led the party to an electoral victory. But philosophically the Republicans had to wait a few decades. The Republican Party's real Moses was Ronald Regan. He was a man who fundamentally understood conservatism and how it benefitted both individual Americans and America as a nation. It's perhaps fitting that as a young man I despised Regan but I now appreciate him and what he did for this country. He stood tall and firm and forced a truely evil empire to admit defeat. And he did so without unnecessarily shedding the blood of American soldiers. And I was one of those soldiers. Reagan was an optimist and an orator and a leader the likes of which we have not seen since FDR, never mind the fact that politically Reagan was FDR's polar opposite. Regan gave conservatism a popular face and clear principles. Republicans since then have squandered them, and we now see the result. We at this point do not have a conservative party--the Republicans are so enamored of \"bipartisanship\" that they will sell each and every one of us down the river to score points with the Democrats. That was McCain's fatal flaw. It's time for us to break from the Republican Party and to accept the demise of that party. A new one will arise in its place. That's pretty much the nature of America--we're optimists....",

Liberals have been on offense for too long, setting the terms of debate. Conservatives must stop playing defense. They must be proactive, bold and courageous in crafting a long-term revolution. Conservatives didn't lose overnight. And they won't win overnight. The path to power lies not in Washington, but in New York and Los Angeles - and everywhere in between.

        "reply": "\u201cThis is why, if the right truly seeks to capture national power, it must abandon its politics-only strategy. That is a road to defeat, decline and eventually, oblivion. It must engage the left on the cultural front, and seek to take back key institutions conservatives have surrendered - often without a fight. Liberals have been on offense for too long, setting the terms of debate. Conservatives must stop playing defense. They must be proactive, bold and courageous in crafting a long-term revolution. Conservatives didn't lose overnight. And they won't win overnight. The path to power lies not in Washington, but in New York and Los Angeles - and everywhere in between. It's the culture, stupid.\u201d Turning to someone like Sarah Palin to stir up the culture war is the same as waiting for the Democrats to over reach \u2013 it is hope in place of a plan. Same sex marriage, gun control and immigration will stir up a loud, active constituency, but even the abortion issue is not going to bring conservatives to power in bad economic times. Republicans, under the guise of conservative leadership, were fiscally irresponsible when they held the purse strings from 1995 until 2007. President Bush betrayed just about every conservative ideal that there is while in office. http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/409192893...102001#1560028102001 Why should anyone trust the Republican Party with power, when they have no plan other than tax cuts and culture wars to lead the country? I believe that real conservative ideals are best for this country. But the disastrous eight years of President Bush\u2019s leadership, along with stupid ideas like igniting a culture war will keep the Republicans and conservatives out of power for years to come.",

The Republicans were long branded as the conservative party and fought the good fight for a while, but they wore out and we saw the evidence of that during the last election. The Republicans were both right and wrong, depending upon historical circumstances. They were right to assert that all men are created equal during the dark and bloody years of our Civil War, but they reneged on that by insisting on isolationism in the years leading up to WWII. 1964 was a watershed year for the Republicans both philosophically and politically. The Republican standard-bearer was Arizona governor Barry Goldwater, a principled man of highly impeccable conservative standards. But historically we were not ready for such a man or his message at that time. One must keep in mind that by the mid 1960s the civil rights movement was reaching a critical tipping point--the majority of Americans were ready to reject the decades-old framework of Jim Crow and integrate black Americans into general society. The question was how would this be done? Harry Truman, a Democrat, took the first step by integrating the armed forces in 1949. In 1950 a black American could command a company of soldiers in places like Korea but could not go and sit with those soldiers for dinner in places like Richmond. This was insanity, and most Americans recognized it as such. By 1964 it was clear that Jim Crow segregation was no longer viable and that black Americans needed to be given entry to all aspects of American life. LBJ sought to do just that through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Not so fast, said Goldwater--this is not the responsibility of the federal government but of the states. Goldwater was technically right but at the time politically wrong--he went down in defeat and was tarred by association with all kinds of kooks from Birchers to Klansmen, never mind that the latter were overwhelmingly Democratic. The 1960s and 1970s were the \"wilderness years\" for the GOP, and this was for good reason. When Moses led the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage he faced a generational period--forty years--of wandering in a hostile wilderness and learning to survive in that wilderness. The Israelites had to learn, by necessity, to stop being slaves and to live or die by their own means. The Republicans had their Moses too, but it's unclear who that Moses was. In strictly political terms it seems that Moses was Richard Nixon, the man who coopted Southern Democrats and led the party to an electoral victory. But philosophically the Republicans had to wait a few decades. The Republican Party's real Moses was Ronald Regan. He was a man who fundamentally understood conservatism and how it benefitted both individual Americans and America as a nation. It's perhaps fitting that as a young man I despised Regan but I now appreciate him and what he did for this country. He stood tall and firm and forced a truely evil empire to admit defeat. And he did so without unnecessarily shedding the blood of American soldiers. And I was one of those soldiers. Reagan was an optimist and an orator and a leader the likes of which we have not seen since FDR, never mind the fact that politically Reagan was FDR's polar opposite. Regan gave conservatism a popular face and clear principles. Republicans since then have squandered them, and we now see the result. We at this point do not have a conservative party--the Republicans are so enamored of \"bipartisanship\" that they will sell each and every one of us down the river to score points with the Democrats. That was McCain's fatal flaw. It's time for us to break from the Republican Party and to accept the demise of that party. A new one will arise in its place.

His new tone in Washington set the stage for total failure in that he would not confront any one would NOT use the veto except when it didn't matter and gave away the store when it came to spending!! The party fell apart under his watch because there was no clear leadership and still isn't!! When people run on clear conservative principles they win...period!! When they try and be all things to all people they lose....period!! The guy who we call president now, is a classical example of triangulation in politics and every one needs to look at the example he gave to win. Run with the base to win the primary, get close, then move to the center and then shift the rhetoric to molify those who are too stupid to see him do it, to the right of center, and win!! It's all in the record and he had a master to teach him.....Clinton!!! It's also great, how he has compromised them, so they can't shoot him in theback politically with the appointments he has given to all the Clinton retreads, and to Hilary. A classic piece of American political chicanery beautifully executed!! Who says Cook County politicians can't teach you all something!! Ain't it just GRAND!!!???",
