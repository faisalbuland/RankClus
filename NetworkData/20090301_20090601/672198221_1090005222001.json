Did you even watch your own link? He was talking about 1976, not this year. No one is being forced to take shots. The only thing SOME people are taking is tamiflu. And that's only if they have it or if they request it. as for why \"WE HAVE HAD ONE SCARE AFTER ANOTHER....WHY IS THAT...IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE LIVING OFF FEAR\". We haven't. You just feel that way and it's most likely because you have a mental problem.",

Every year in the US, about 36 THOUSAND people die of influenza or its complications, and between a quarter and half MILLION people die of it around the world. Per year. You can look it up, go ahead, I'll wait ....... In 1976, when Swine Flu immunizations were offered (note: \"offered,\" not \"mandated\"), 1 person died of that strain of influenza and 39 died of Guillian-Barre or other complications from the vaccine itself. Deaths from influenza vaccine complications over the past decade? YOU look it up: damn few in the US. I thought your thread title seemed interesting, so stopped to take a look, mostly because I have a serious problem with politicians who are not medical professionals making all sorts of dubious claims about this, that or the other (Chris Dodd and his anti-childhood vaccine campaign is a real irritant, and Tommy Thompson's handling of PR around the anthrax attacks was just plain pathetic). But alas - it's just more lunatic ranting from the uninformed. Oh, and just out of curiosity, why should the VP ride a bus? He has a taxpayer-funded limo, for heaven's sake!",
