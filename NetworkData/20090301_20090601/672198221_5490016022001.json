No other rule, just one, and that one is strictly enforced. If this were practiced it would not take too long for the word to get out.",

The country, if one can really call it that, is totally run by warlords, pirates, criminals, all ruling or having control over some sections of the country by right of arms over anyone that would try to remove them from their position of illegal and unrecognised power. The only way this situation will be reversed is that all nations, that is all responsible nations of the world combine thier navies and/or land forces to protect commerce and citizens of their nations against such acts of terrorism. The order of the day throughout the world seems to be the power taken by criminals over their countries and their people for whatever reason. This is not a plea for aid or help to re-establish a form of control over criminal activity but a outright thumbing their noses at any form of law or protection for any person within thier scope of attacks. This is the result of criminal and dictatorial leaders taking away the rule of law, whatever law, from nations and/or regions. Pitifully, we here in the United States are in somewhat the same situation with our elected elitest officials thumbing their noses at the Constitution and taking powers they do not have under the auspicies of that rule of law. This rule by dictators and anarchist is the very reason that the United Nations was formed, the very reason that Woody Wilson proposed the League of Nations, as flawed as it was. The UN is a eunuch among organizations worldwide, and now the world is reaching the point where another world war against terrorists, plural, of any type have gained more and more power by virtue of the fact that the leaders of the supposedly free nations and even those of the Marxist realm are not and have not been doing the job they have sworn to do, and thereby caused a vaccuum of law and order. The world is fast reaching the situation when ANARCHY wil be the single most powerful form of governing, or non-governing, the world has ever known. there is almost a TOTAL LACK of statesmanship in our modern world akin to the stature of mankind prior to the forming of clans and estended families in the days of our prehistoric ancestors who banded together to acquire some semblence of security in their designated caves and hunting grounds. Ww are headed backwards with the evolution of mankind instead of foward. Only this time it will be with weapons of mass destruction available around the world and the individual will, if our legislators have their way about it, no weapons of any kind to fight back against such tyranny and/or anarchy. OPur previous world wars and wars among bnations had soem semblence of order aboput them with definite enemies fighting each other. The wars to come, and actually already in progress, have no defined enemies or territories, but any one who happens to be the way of those with criminal intent, and those perps are protected by those without the gonads to fight back or even allow others to fight the criminals of the world. I have little faith in ANY NATION OR LEADER of this day and time to stand up for the rights of mankind to attempt to live in some semblence of peace, The coming civil wars, territorial conflicts, so-called religious wars, and world domination by anmarchist and dictatorial powers will destroy all law and order to the point that the individual who has the wherewithal to protect his/her own will be the only survivors, until the criminal \"gangs\" find and route them out, inother words slay them also. Man has put himself above his Creator for so long and so effectively that Mankind now has very little hope of survival and this planet will be left to the largest group of inhabitants, the insects. Doomsday? Yes. and we the ignorant and dis-educated of the world have brought it on ourselves!!!!!!!!!",
