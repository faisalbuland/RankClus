I thought Joan and her daughter were embarrassing and over reacted when the daughter got the boot. The only thing I will say for Joan is she was right when she said she said the bad things to Annie's face and Annie did it all behind Joans back. I don't blame Annie for saying what she did about Joan because Joan and her daughter had it coming and then some, they act like they are the victim is all of this.",
