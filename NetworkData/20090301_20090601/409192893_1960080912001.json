People returning from OEF and OIF who are disabled and released from active duty back into the community must wait many months for the VA Adjudication process to be completed. PTSD, TBI, and acquired illnesses claims have wounds not visible to the eye and often prevent the returnee from resuming a living. Then the often long wait for the process to be completed. We know the fast track is in place, but it still takes many months in most cases to get PTSD and acquired illness cases resolved. In a few months of low, or no income the veteran often loses what they had worked to achieve. Mental Healthcare is limited far more than an acceptable level. Budget planning for VA should consider the Veteran Service Organizations (VSO) recommended budget which is submitted annually. The VSO's put much effort into determination of needs of the veteran.

        "content": "Just to support the above post I made. On the first page of the topic I linked, you will find the following post: Posted Wed 26 November 2003 which was posted by me from the VA Hotline. This was 5 1/2 years ago and still is a major problem. The following is a brief description of some of the key steps that VA has taken to prepare for veterans from Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) in the 7 months since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom (March 19th, 2003). Immediate Health Care Needs for Combat Veterans: In response to immediate health concerns for OIF and OEF veterans, on March 26 and 27, 2003, VA developed a program called \u201cCaring for the War Wounded,\u201d which was broadcast over the VA Knowledge Network satellite broadcast system. Provided timely and relevant information about the anticipated health care needs of veterans of the current conflict in Iraq. Included VA experts on treatments for traumatic injuries; chemical warfare agent health effects; infectious diseases; radiological health effects; and post-deployment readjustment health concerns. Made a new Veterans Health Initiative (VHI) independent study guide, called \u201cCaring for the War Wounded,\u201d which is available to all VA health care providers online at vaww.va.gov/VHI/ and on the Internet at http://www.appc1.va.gov/vhi/. New Clinical Guidelines for Combat Veteran Health Care: In collaboration with DoD, VA developed two Clinical Practice Guidelines on combat veteran health issues, including one general guideline to post-deployment health, and a second dealing with unexplained pain and fatigue. Give our providers the best medical evidence for diagnoses and treatment. Highly recommended for the evaluation and care of all returning combat veterans, including OIF and OEF veterans. Available on line at www.va.gov/environagents, under the heading, \u201cEnvironmental Health Clinicians.\u201d New Specialized Combat Veteran Health Care Program: In 2001, VA established two new War Related Illness and Injury Study Centers, or \u201cWRIISCs\u201d as they have become to be known, at the Washington, DC, and East Orange, NJ VAMCs. Today providing specialized health care for combat veterans from all deployments who experience difficult to diagnose but disabling illnesses. Concerns about unexplained illness are seen after all deployments including OIF, but we are building on our understand of these illnesses. More information available online at www.va.gov/environagents under the heading \u201c WRIISC Referral Eligibility Information.\u201d Expanded Education on Combat Health Care for VA Providers: In addition to the programs already described, VA has developed a Veterans Health Initiative (VHI) Independent Study Guide called \u201cA Guide to Gulf War Veterans Health.\u201d Originally on health care for combat veterans from the 1991 Gulf War, this product is also very relevant for OIF and OEF combat veterans because most of the hazardous exposures are the same. Written for both clinicians, and for veterans and their families. Available in print, on a CD ROM. Outreach to Combat Veterans: VA has many new products to offer combat veterans and their families. In collaboration with DoD, VA published and distributed one million copies of a new short brochure called \u201cA Summary of VA Benefits for National Guard and Reservists Personnel.\u201d which summarizes health care and other benefits available to this special population of combat veterans upon their return to civilian life. It is also available online at www.va.gov/environagents near the bottom of the page. Another brochure produced called \u201cHealth Care and Assistance for U.S. Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom,\u201d on basic health issues for that deployment. Improvements in Health Care Eligibility: VA has promoted new eligibility rules that provide reservists and active duty personnel who served in a designated combat zone such as Iraq or Afghanistan with 2 years of free health care from VA. Streamlines access to health care for recently separated combat veterans. Summarized in the brochure \u201cSpecial VA Healthcare Eligibility for Combat Veterans. Special DU program: OIF veterans concerned about possible exposure to depleted uranium can be evaluated using a special DU exposure protocol that VA began after the 1991 Gulf War. Combat Veteran Health Status Surveillance: Today we can monitor the overall health status of combat veterans remarkably well using VA\u2019s electronic inpatient and outpatient medical records. This surveillance summarizes every single visit by a combat veteran including all medical diagnoses. VA\u2019s Gulf War registry remains open to all OIF veterans. Finally, we are developing a new Clinical Reminder (part of VA\u2019s computerized reminder system) to assist VA primary care clinicians in providing timely and appropriate care to new combat veterans.
