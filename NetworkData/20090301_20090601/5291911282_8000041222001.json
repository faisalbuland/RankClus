When the pictures of \"TORTURE' of terroists are released will they make you like us or hate us? From my own viewpoint I think that they are going to make us look bad in other nations and I think that they will make us LESS SAFE from attack. thanks for the pictures you sent, they confirm what I think is true torture. thanks for your understanding.I know some American have high education and good qualify. But I want to said that I don't care obama's show!!! Releasing the terrorist is a show give to her advocate. but Why they want to hit American? because American amry kill their brother,occupy their country. why china is so safe?certainly,we never offence others frist,and we have nuclear weapon that other strong country cann't offence ous. your president's activity wheather he realse them, cann't move other countries's people. obama always said \"change\", however,I think if your amry really retreat from other countries' land, the American's impression to other people will be really change. But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious", 
        "reply": " We are safer because of the brave men and women in uniform that are stationed abroad and at home that do their jobs selflessly everyday. They don't get to call in sick when they don't want to go to work and they don't get to choose how much time they get to spend with their children and families all because their job is to keep their fellow countrymen safe. So please don't come in here flailing your arms and legs about how America is BAD and we need to stop what we're doing... the men and women in this forum are members, veterans, and/or family members of service personnel, and do not need another Anti-war, anti-american loon chasing after them. If you would like to have an intelligent and legitmate conversation, then you've come to no better place, but please don't turn this into a propaganda post, it's not sympathized here.",

Do you know? In1946,when china break out our civilian war,two sides of chinese soldier sometimes cry for this ****ing war.But they have no chioce.they must have something to eat ,something to wear which the old government cann't give them. I really hope this kind of thing would never be happen again in our new country. Everyone in china want the old government ,taiwan government can admit our mistake in before and unify again. the civilian war was a history,government now had change a lot before. we are really free,and happy living in this country,we can sucess all by our hardwork as American.

        "quote": "Originally posted by Bladensburg: NRJustin - Do you not find it ironic that your own civil wars and revolutions have probably killed far more Chinese people than the Japanese - reprehensible as they may be - ever did? Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people. Now stop rattling your sabre like a grumpy child and get a grip.", 
        "reply": " respond to Bladensburg seriously: I was so pity that own civil wars is just like two groverment fight for their political power. at last,Communist Party won. from my point of view,civilian are so weak that they can control this war.

Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

I did pull this site off one of the pics and go to it. It's interesting and like the posts, a little strange. \"http://www.thenausea.com/\" I'd like to know what some of you think about the site. The site looks nothing more than to be a sadist's dream.... It's interesting how all of the photos of \"mis-deeds\" of the US are from 1800s to about 1920s and all of the other countries are more recent like 2005, 2006 etc. And yet, we're evil", 
        "reply": " Of course we're evil. Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious",

Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

When the pictures of \"TORTURE' of terroists are released will they make you like us or hate us? From my own viewpoint I think that they are going to make us look bad in other nations and I think that they will make us LESS SAFE from attack. thanks for the pictures you sent, they confirm what I think is true torture. thanks for your understanding.I know some American have high education and good qualify. But I want to said that I don't care obama's show!!! Releasing the terrorist is a show give to her advocate. but Why they want to hit American? because American amry kill their brother,occupy their country. why china is so safe?certainly,we never offence others frist,and we have nuclear weapon that other strong country cann't offence ous. your president's activity wheather he realse them, cann't move other countries's people. obama always said \"change\", however,I think if your amry really retreat from other countries' land, the American's impression to other people will be really change. But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious", 
        "reply": " We are safer because of the brave men and women in uniform that are stationed abroad and at home that do their jobs selflessly everyday. They don't get to call in sick when they don't want to go to work and they don't get to choose how much time they get to spend with their children and families all because their job is to keep their fellow countrymen safe. So please don't come in here flailing your arms and legs about how America is BAD and we need to stop what we're doing... the men and women in this forum are members, veterans, and/or family members of service personnel, and do not need another Anti-war, anti-american loon chasing after them. If you would like to have an intelligent and legitmate conversation, then you've come to no better place, but please don't turn this into a propaganda post, it's not sympathized here.",

Do you know? In1946,when china break out our civilian war,two sides of chinese soldier sometimes cry for this ****ing war.But they have no chioce.they must have something to eat ,something to wear which the old government cann't give them. I really hope this kind of thing would never be happen again in our new country. Everyone in china want the old government ,taiwan government can admit our mistake in before and unify again. the civilian war was a history,government now had change a lot before. we are really free,and happy living in this country,we can sucess all by our hardwork as American. Western people should renew their thought .",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Bladensburg: NRJustin - Do you not find it ironic that your own civil wars and revolutions have probably killed far more Chinese people than the Japanese - reprehensible as they may be - ever did? Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people. Now stop rattling your sabre like a grumpy child and get a grip.", 
        "reply": " respond to Bladensburg seriously: I was so pity that own civil wars is just like two groverment fight for their political power. at last,Communist Party won. from my point of view,civilian are so weak that they can control this war.

Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

I did pull this site off one of the pics and go to it. It's interesting and like the posts, a little strange. \"http://www.thenausea.com/\" I'd like to know what some of you think about the site. The site looks nothing more than to be a sadist's dream.... It's interesting how all of the photos of \"mis-deeds\" of the US are from 1800s to about 1920s and all of the other countries are more recent like 2005, 2006 etc. And yet, we're evil", 
        "reply": " Of course we're evil. Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious",

Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

When the pictures of \"TORTURE' of terroists are released will they make you like us or hate us? From my own viewpoint I think that they are going to make us look bad in other nations and I think that they will make us LESS SAFE from attack. thanks for the pictures you sent, they confirm what I think is true torture. thanks for your understanding.I know some American have high education and good qualify. But I want to said that I don't care obama's show!!! Releasing the terrorist is a show give to her advocate. but Why they want to hit American? because American amry kill their brother,occupy their country. why china is so safe?certainly,we never offence others frist,and we have nuclear weapon that other strong country cann't offence ous. your president's activity wheather he realse them, cann't move other countries's people. obama always said \"change\", however,I think if your amry really retreat from other countries' land, the American's impression to other people will be really change. But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious", 
        "reply": " We are safer because of the brave men and women in uniform that are stationed abroad and at home that do their jobs selflessly everyday. They don't get to call in sick when they don't want to go to work and they don't get to choose how much time they get to spend with their children and families all because their job is to keep their fellow countrymen safe. So please don't come in here flailing your arms and legs about how America is BAD and we need to stop what we're doing... the men and women in this forum are members, veterans, and/or family members of service personnel, and do not need another Anti-war, anti-american loon chasing after them. If you would like to have an intelligent and legitmate conversation, then you've come to no better place, but please don't turn this into a propaganda post, it's not sympathized here.",

Do you know? In1946,when china break out our civilian war,two sides of chinese soldier sometimes cry for this ****ing war.But they have no chioce.they must have something to eat ,something to wear which the old government cann't give them. I really hope this kind of thing would never be happen again in our new country. Everyone in china want the old government ,taiwan government can admit our mistake in before and unify again. the civilian war was a history,government now had change a lot before. we are really free,and happy living in this country,we can sucess all by our hardwork as American. Western people should renew their thought .",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Bladensburg: NRJustin - Do you not find it ironic that your own civil wars and revolutions have probably killed far more Chinese people than the Japanese - reprehensible as they may be - ever did? Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people. Now stop rattling your sabre like a grumpy child and get a grip.", 
        "reply": " respond to Bladensburg seriously: I was so pity that own civil wars is just like two groverment fight for their political power. at last,Communist Party won. from my point of view,civilian are so weak that they can control this war.

Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

I did pull this site off one of the pics and go to it. It's interesting and like the posts, a little strange. \"http://www.thenausea.com/\" I'd like to know what some of you think about the site. The site looks nothing more than to be a sadist's dream.... It's interesting how all of the photos of \"mis-deeds\" of the US are from 1800s to about 1920s and all of the other countries are more recent like 2005, 2006 etc. And yet, we're evil", 
        "reply": " Of course we're evil. Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious",

Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

When the pictures of \"TORTURE' of terroists are released will they make you like us or hate us? From my own viewpoint I think that they are going to make us look bad in other nations and I think that they will make us LESS SAFE from attack. thanks for the pictures you sent, they confirm what I think is true torture. thanks for your understanding.I know some American have high education and good qualify. But I want to said that I don't care obama's show!!! Releasing the terrorist is a show give to her advocate. but Why they want to hit American? because American amry kill their brother,occupy their country. why china is so safe?certainly,we never offence others frist,and we have nuclear weapon that other strong country cann't offence ous. your president's activity wheather he realse them, cann't move other countries's people. obama always said \"change\", however,I think if your amry really retreat from other countries' land, the American's impression to other people will be really change. But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious", 
        "reply": " We are safer because of the brave men and women in uniform that are stationed abroad and at home that do their jobs selflessly everyday. They don't get to call in sick when they don't want to go to work and they don't get to choose how much time they get to spend with their children and families all because their job is to keep their fellow countrymen safe. So please don't come in here flailing your arms and legs about how America is BAD and we need to stop what we're doing... the men and women in this forum are members, veterans, and/or family members of service personnel, and do not need another Anti-war, anti-american loon chasing after them. If you would like to have an intelligent and legitmate conversation, then you've come to no better place, but please don't turn this into a propaganda post, it's not sympathized here.",

Do you know? In1946,when china break out our civilian war,two sides of chinese soldier sometimes cry for this ****ing war.But they have no chioce.they must have something to eat ,something to wear which the old government cann't give them. I really hope this kind of thing would never be happen again in our new country. Everyone in china want the old government ,taiwan government can admit our mistake in before and unify again. the civilian war was a history,government now had change a lot before. we are really free,and happy living in this country,we can sucess all by our hardwork as American. Western people should renew their thought .",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Bladensburg: NRJustin - Do you not find it ironic that your own civil wars and revolutions have probably killed far more Chinese people than the Japanese - reprehensible as they may be - ever did? Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people. Now stop rattling your sabre like a grumpy child and get a grip.", 
        "reply": " respond to Bladensburg seriously: I was so pity that own civil wars is just like two groverment fight for their political power. at last,Communist Party won. from my point of view,civilian are so weak that they can control this war.

Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

I did pull this site off one of the pics and go to it. It's interesting and like the posts, a little strange. \"http://www.thenausea.com/\" I'd like to know what some of you think about the site. The site looks nothing more than to be a sadist's dream.... It's interesting how all of the photos of \"mis-deeds\" of the US are from 1800s to about 1920s and all of the other countries are more recent like 2005, 2006 etc. And yet, we're evil", 
        "reply": " Of course we're evil. Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

I try to use my poor English to explain something. when American haven't be the strongest country in the history,he is a good boy.I know when we fight for Japanese, American government give us a lot of weapon and the fire aid of USA air force. but we also know how many times does American be hit first? just British and Japanese have do it. you can use your finger to count it(but you can count the number of the war USA do just with your finger,it is too much), and USA break out a war approximately per five year. It is right? OK? I would talk about the korea war.This war made the chinese amry famous. why do USA help north korea defence? you are so innocent .where is the korea peninsula?It near the biggest Social Democracy--soviet and the second biggest Social Democracy--china. USA Air Force can do everything he want if USA control this land\uff01 this war is for benifit but not for freedom!!!! Do you think chinese amry are really crazy?Do you think we use the old gun to fight with the USA Air Fore is just for killing? In fact, this war is a plot.china have not chioce to fight,but incredibly,we won the USA soldier who just like the play boy.because our soldier know if we failure,we will lost our hometown and country soon",

But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious",

Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people.

When the pictures of \"TORTURE' of terroists are released will they make you like us or hate us? From my own viewpoint I think that they are going to make us look bad in other nations and I think that they will make us LESS SAFE from attack. thanks for the pictures you sent, they confirm what I think is true torture. thanks for your understanding.I know some American have high education and good qualify. But I want to said that I don't care obama's show!!! Releasing the terrorist is a show give to her advocate. but Why they want to hit American? because American amry kill their brother,occupy their country. why china is so safe?certainly,we never offence others frist,and we have nuclear weapon that other strong country cann't offence ous. your president's activity wheather he realse them, cann't move other countries's people. obama always said \"change\", however,I think if your amry really retreat from other countries' land, the American's impression to other people will be really change. But I know it is impossible?Right? stop your war and painting dollar,I believe everyone in the world will admire American. American also will be safer. and the question of obama's lead is too difficult to answer,and discuss it is too early,you and I are also hope this guy can change our world from complex to harmonious", 
        "reply": " We are safer because of the brave men and women in uniform that are stationed abroad and at home that do their jobs selflessly everyday. They don't get to call in sick when they don't want to go to work and they don't get to choose how much time they get to spend with their children and families all because their job is to keep their fellow countrymen safe. So please don't come in here flailing your arms and legs about how America is BAD and we need to stop what we're doing... the men and women in this forum are members, veterans, and/or family members of service personnel, and do not need another Anti-war, anti-american loon chasing after them. If you would like to have an intelligent and legitmate conversation, then you've come to no better place, but please don't turn this into a propaganda post, it's not sympathized here.",

Do you know? In1946,when china break out our civilian war,two sides of chinese soldier sometimes cry for this ****ing war.But they have no chioce.they must have something to eat ,something to wear which the old government cann't give them. I really hope this kind of thing would never be happen again in our new country. Everyone in china want the old government ,taiwan government can admit our mistake in before and unify again. the civilian war was a history,government now had change a lot before. we are really free,and happy living in this country,we can sucess all by our hardwork as American. Western people should renew their thought .",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Bladensburg: NRJustin - Do you not find it ironic that your own civil wars and revolutions have probably killed far more Chinese people than the Japanese - reprehensible as they may be - ever did? Furthermore while the Japanese may be collectively blind to their past sins and may well be a pretty racist culture they are at least now a reasonably free nation that refrains from treating large numbers of people very badly. Can you honestly say that China is anywhere near as free as Japan or that the Chinese government does not treat man of its people very badly? I doubt it. Let's be honest the place with the most freedom in the whole of China is only that way because it used to be in someone else's empire and even there in Hong Kong the government does its best to suppress people. Now stop rattling your sabre like a grumpy child and get a grip.", 
        "reply": " respond to Bladensburg seriously: I was so pity that own civil wars is just like two groverment fight for their political power. at last,Communist Party won. from my point of view,civilian are so weak that they can control this war.

Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!

I did pull this site off one of the pics and go to it. It's interesting and like the posts, a little strange. \"http://www.thenausea.com/\" I'd like to know what some of you think about the site. The site looks nothing more than to be a sadist's dream.... It's interesting how all of the photos of \"mis-deeds\" of the US are from 1800s to about 1920s and all of the other countries are more recent like 2005, 2006 etc. And yet, we're evil", 
        "reply": " Of course we're evil. Everyone knows that. We do all sorts of evil things all the time like sending truckloads of money to needy nations. We inundate them with free medicines and doctors to work in the hospitals that we build. In a most evil manner we build power plants and provide them with drinking water and food. I'm getting sick of all the evil things we're doing around the world. I think we should stop doing the evil things I've mentioned and spend the money for projects right here in AMERICA!
