Believes in Government involvment in the press, and was a member of this leftist spin machine: The National Security Network (NSN) is a progressive, non-profit foreign policy organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. that focuses on international relations, global affairs and national security. According to its mission statement, the National Security Network aims to \"build a strong progressive national security and counter conservative spin.\" Its founder, Rand Beers, was a Bush Administration counter-terrorism expert and is the former National Security Adviser to the John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004. Rand Beers resigned from NSN in 2009 to serve as Counselor to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano[1]. Among other things, the National Security Network acts as a resource for media outlets, releasing frequent opinion papers on a wide variety of foreign policy issues and engaging in rapid responses to current events. It also hosts the liberal global affairs blog Democracy Arsenal [1] Contents [hide] 1 History and Mission 2 Projects 3 The NSN Community 4 Local Chapters 5 Rand Beers Controversy 6 References 7 External links [edit] History and Mission The National Security Network was founded in 2006 by counter-terrorism expert and two-decade White House veteran Rand Beers. Beers led the Department of Homeland Security review team for Barack Obama's transition.[2] He resigned from NSN in 2009 to serve as Counselor to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano[3]. NSN\u2019s mission is to develop pragmatic and principled progressive national security policies for a new era. The organization believes in building upon the greatest legacies of American foreign policy through combining a strong and flexible military with shrewd diplomacy; the strategic and effective use of alliances; and above all, an unwavering commitment to America\u2019s basic values.[4] [edit] Projects NSN works with a large network of experts to identify, develop, and communicate progressive national security policy solutions, focusing on the current issues of our time. NSN\u2019s products include policy briefs, developed by NSN\u2019s Policy Basics Project; the pre-eminent Democracy Arsenal blog; and the War Room, NSN\u2019s rapid response operation. In partnership with the US in the World project of Demos (U.S. think tank), NSN is deeply involved with the Who Owns Security project, which seeks to determine how the American public currently views the parties on national security; why the public holds those attitudes and feelings; and where they do or don\u2019t connect with specific national security issues. NSN experts are frequently invited to speak on a variety of foreign policy issues at events nationwide. [edit] The NSN Community The National Security Network distributes its message to elected officials, political candidates, the media, national security experts, community leaders, and non-governmental organizations.

Believes in Government involvment in the press, and was a member of this leftist spin machine: The National Security Network (NSN) is a progressive, non-profit foreign policy organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. that focuses on international relations, global affairs and national security. According to its mission statement, the National Security Network aims to \"build a strong progressive national security and counter conservative spin.\" Its founder, Rand Beers, was a Bush Administration counter-terrorism expert and is the former National Security Adviser to the John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004. Rand Beers resigned from NSN in 2009 to serve as Counselor to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano[1]. Among other things, the National Security Network acts as a resource for media outlets, releasing frequent opinion papers on a wide variety of foreign policy issues and engaging in rapid responses to current events. It also hosts the liberal global affairs blog Democracy Arsenal [1] Contents [hide] 1 History and Mission 2 Projects 3 The NSN Community 4 Local Chapters 5 Rand Beers Controversy 6 References 7 External links [edit] History and Mission The National Security Network was founded in 2006 by counter-terrorism expert and two-decade White House veteran Rand Beers. Beers led the Department of Homeland Security review team for Barack Obama's transition.[2] He resigned from NSN in 2009 to serve as Counselor to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano[3]. NSN\u2019s mission is to develop pragmatic and principled progressive national security policies for a new era. The organization believes in building upon the greatest legacies of American foreign policy through combining a strong and flexible military with shrewd diplomacy; the strategic and effective use of alliances; and above all, an unwavering commitment to America\u2019s basic values.[4] [edit] Projects NSN works with a large network of experts to identify, develop, and communicate progressive national security policy solutions, focusing on the current issues of our time. NSN\u2019s products include policy briefs, developed by NSN\u2019s Policy Basics Project; the pre-eminent Democracy Arsenal blog; and the War Room, NSN\u2019s rapid response operation. In partnership with the US in the World project of Demos (U.S. think tank), NSN is deeply involved with the Who Owns Security project, which seeks to determine how the American public currently views the parties on national security; why the public holds those attitudes and feelings; and where they do or don\u2019t connect with specific national security issues. NSN experts are frequently invited to speak on a variety of foreign policy issues at events nationwide.
