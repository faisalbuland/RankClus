Some of the disadvantaed and unemployed decided they'd rather have the money than go see Leno. They put their tickets up on E-Bay. An incensed Leno put the Kaibosh on it. \"How dare those ungrateful unemployed folks derive any real benefit from my benefit show.\" When faced with the fact that some of the \"poor\" thought they needed money more than a joke or two, Leno's ego overruled and unmasked his altruistic gesture. It's always like this with the left and liberals. It's all feelings and perception and never anything substantial.",

It's not a joke. He gave out free tickets to the unemployed and then stopped their sale on E-Bay. Getting a free ticket because you're down and out isn't exacttly the same as a free ticket because someone appreciates you. If I had no money or job and could get 20 bucks for a ticket to see a guy I can see every night on TV anyway? His ego got in the y of his altruism.
