But the 'conventional wisdom' that governs such things, as in the AIDS virus, seems to be that the sooner we all get it, the easier it will be to deal with. Biden's right. Travelling sick or with the sick, like it has always been, is the best, read only, way to spread an infectious disease. To-day's aircraft just make that transmission faster, and easier. To-day's air transportation is a potential disease vector. This message has been edited. Last edited by: popsiq, Fri 01 May 2009 06:59 AM",
