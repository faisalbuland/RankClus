A perusal through Obama's current Wikipedia entry finds a heavily guarded, mostly glowing biography about the U.S. president. Some of Obama's most controversial past affiliations, including with Rev. Jeremiah Wright and former Weathermen terrorist Bill Ayers, are not once mentioned, even though those associations received much news media attention and served as dominant themes during the presidential elections last year. Also completely lacking is any mention of the well-publicized concerns surrounding Obama's eligibility to serve as commander-in-chief. Where's the proof Barack Obama was born in the U.S. or that he fulfills the \"natural-born American\" clause in the Constitution? If you still want to see it, join more than 300,000 others and sign up now! Indeed, multiple times, Wikipedia users who wrote about the eligibility issues had their entries deleted almost immediately and were banned from re-posting any material on the website for three days. In one example, Wikipedia user \"Jerusalem21\" added the following to Obama's page: \"There have been some doubts about whether Obama was born in the U.S. after the politician refused to release to the public a carbon copy of his birth certificate and amid claims from his relatives he may have been born in Kenya. Numerous lawsuits have been filed petitioning Obama to release his birth certificate, but most suits have been thrown out by the courts.\" As is required on the online encyclopedia, that entry was backed up by third-party media articles, citing the Chicago Tribune and WorldNetDaily.com The entry was posted on Feb. 24, at 6:16 p.m. EST. Just three minutes later, the entry was removed by a Wikipedia administrator, claiming the posting violated the websites rules against \"fringe\" material.",

See if gb2's conspiracies are on wiki. I read President Bushs wiki entry and theres no mention of 9/11 conspiracies or the like. The sentance pulled out about critics doesnt reflect the overall section that covers his service at all. As a matter of fact you could have pulled out either of these bolded statements which are in direct opposition to any internet theories about President Bush's service: May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard.[23] After training, he was assigned to duty in Houston, flying Convair F-102s out of Ellington Air Force Base.[24] Critics allege that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing, citing his selection as a pilot and his irregular attendance.[25] In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[26] In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the Alabama Air National Guard, having moved to Memphis to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount. In October 1973, Bush was discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to inactive duty in the Air Force Reserve. He was discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974, at the end of his six-year service obligation.[2",

John Hemenway is a World War II veteran, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy (class of 1951) and a Rhodes Scholar. He served in the Foreign Service in the former Soviet Union and in Germany as Chief of the Berlin section. Mr. Obama's lawyers are now threatening my 84-year-old father-in-law, through Judge Robertson, with penalties of legal fees for pursuing the truth about Mr. Obama's birth. This threat of financial sanctions is meant to silence all of us who remain unsatisfied with equivocations by the Obama camp about his legal qualifications to become President, and to punish us for pursuing our Constitutionally-guaranteed right to redress. The Obama campaign, with questions about his birth in Kenya to his Kenyan father (a British citizen), and his years in Indonesia where he was known as Barry Soetoro (taking the surname of his stepfather), was not nearly as forthcoming as the McCain campaign. What was posted in support of Mr. Obama's eligibility was not a birth certificate, but something that resembles a \"Certification of Live Birth\" or COLB, which, even if authentic, does not prove \"natural born\" U.S. citizenship. In Hawaii, a Certification of Live Birth is issued within a year of a child's birth to those who register a birth overseas or one that takes place outside of a hospital. What is most intriguing (and of course, elevated the eligibility controversy) is that it was largely fueled by a political ally of Hillary Clinton, now Obama's Secretary of State. This also begs the question of whether Mr. Obama provided Mrs. Clinton a Cabinet post in part to make this issue go away. Phillip Berg, a Democrat who served as Deputy Attorney General in Pennsylvania, filed suit to demand that Mr. Obama produce documents to prove his eligibility. It's hard for Obama fans to claim this is part of a vast right-wing conspiracy when it was an obvious attempt by the Clinton camp to derail on technical grounds, the Obama express train to the White House. Why would a sitting President, now that the campaign has ended, not turn over the documents to end the controversy? If those who believe he's hiding something are wrong, would they acknowledge that it is in his political interest to disprove the \"conspiracy theorists,\" as Judge Robertson refers to them? Logic tells anyone looking at this objectively that it is nonsensical for President Obama to retain three law firms and to expend heavy costs of legal fees to hide records (some estimates are upwards of $1 million), unless there is something worth hiding from the American people. Embarrassingly, Members of Congress have offered up \"SNOPES\" and other flawed websites by way of background information to constituents troubled by the refusal by President Barack Obama to disclose any vital records which would prove his eligibility to be President. During the campaign, SNOPES alleged that Obama could obtain a security clearance. Having been interviewed numerous times by investigators for colleagues and co-workers seeking security clearances or periodic updates for existing clearances, Mr. Obama had numerous \"red flags\" in his background which would preclude the privilege of holding a clearance and access to classified government information \u2013 including his affiliation with known \"subversive\" individuals and organizations such as Weather Underground/unrepentant domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, Frank Marshall Davis (CPUSA), and PLO official Rashid Khalidi (at a time that the PLO was an officially designated terrorist organization) and Obama's admitted use of a hard drug \u2013 cocaine. SNOPES is discredited as a result of these pro-Obama, misleading assertions. (Running for high elective office obviates the requirement to undergo security clearance scrutiny since the clearance is automatically granted by virtue of the position attained.) In addition to the indefensible references to SNOPES, it is embarrassing that the staff of some sitting Members of Congress (we will hope the Members didn't actually vet this correspondence and that these responses were simply emails handled by low-level legislative aides) failed to do their homework and included in letters to constituents such incorrect information as stating that Mr. Obama's birth certificate was posted showing he was born in Hawaii. The issue of the location of his birth remains in dispute, especially since Obama's paternal Grandmother and others have asserted that he was born in Kenya. Given this level of general incompetency and sloppiness within the Congress, is it any surprise that a sitting Judge (U.S. District Court Judge John Robertson, a Clinton appointee) would follow suit, and imply that the critical legal, Constitutional issue of whether Mr. Obama is eligible to be President, has already been determined by Twittering and blogging? The intellectual sloppiness and disregard for the requirements of the Constitution appear to be pouring over into U.S. courtrooms as well. Sen. John McCain, born to American parents at a U.S. military base, in contrast, was investigated for his birth in the Panama Canal Zone and to quell the dispute, produced his birth records. The Senate voted unanimously (in a nonbinding resolution) in April 2008 to declare that McCain was indeed, an eligible candidate. A senior official of the McCain campaign showed a reporter a copy of the senator's birth certificate issued by Canal Zone health authorities. We are, first and foremost, a nation of law where laws are supposed to apply equitably to all Americans. Mr. Obama is not above the law. When I am required to produce my valid birth certificate in order to obtain a copy of my daughter's birth records from the Commonwealth of Virginia, then I expect at least the same standard of proof to be provided by a candidate for the highest elective office in the land. This is not a political issue \u2013 it is a legal issue and one of paramount national importance. Some question the wisdom of \"undoing\" an election if Obama's doubters are proven right. My father-in-law has lived through a World War, an actual impeachment and a President who was forced to resign under threat of impeachment \u2013 the nation survived, without chaos. The greatest danger to our freedom is disrespect for the Constitution and a President, who by his failure to provide evidence of his eligibility for the Presidency, evidently doesn't believe the rules should apply to him.",

The sentance pulled out about critics doesnt reflect the overall section that covers his service at all. As a matter of fact you could have pulled out either of these bolded statements which are in direct opposition to any internet theories about President Bush's service: May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard.[23] After training, he was assigned to duty in Houston, flying Convair F-102s out of Ellington Air Force Base.[24] Critics allege that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing, citing his selection as a pilot and his irregular attendance.[25] In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[26] In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the Alabama Air National Guard, having moved to Memphis to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount. In October 1973, Bush was discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to inactive duty in the Air Force Reserve. He was discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974, at the end of his six-year service obligation.[2 If you read Mr. Bush's official record you will see that there are gaps that do not PROVE that the alligations of irregular attendance are false. As for Mr. Bush getting slot because of political influence, and remember given his families power the influence may not have been overt or deliberate, the FACT that Mr. Bush seems to have been jumped over others for a slot in the guard and for the training gives at least the APPEARANCE of favoritism. The difference between this and Mr. Obama's citizen status is that there is no reasonable doubt since the state has verified his birth status. Also the few times I saw the posts or copies of the posts before they were removed they did NOT have any qualification to them that STATED Mr Obama was not qualified for office there was not statements such as \"some critics allege he is not qualified because of <some facts given here>\". [sign language ] The point is an allegatio0n of Dad's influence is mentioned in the wiki on gb2. An allegation. And No Proof. The same is not on Obamas. The group that question his citizenship wanted to see an actual copy of the B-cert not some computer printoff [/ sign language ]",

There was NO special treatment for Mr. Obama and No special attack on Mr. Bush. The claim that Mr. Obama is not qualifed has been disproven, the claim that political influence got Mr Bush his slot, got him permission to skip training to help with a political campaign, kept him from getting in major trouble for not taking his flight physical (which meant his training was wasted), and allowed him to skip more training days than he should have been allowed has NOT been disproven. In FACT looking at Mr. Bush's service record shows that at best he got better treatment (the unit slot in the first place and the pilot training slot) than usual and got away with more stuff than usual.",
