The news has the right to report on it with whichever perspective it wants. And so on. Why? Because they're private individuals. The GOVERNMENT and the LAW, however, must grant ALL people the same rights, freedoms, and protections. So, were Miss CA and Miss RI treated the same way? Legally, yes, and that's the only issue. In fact, this wasn't an issue of law whatsoever, so the law didn't even get involved. This was all a matter of private business and private citizens' opinions. If Miss CA were to apply for a job and were to be denied the job because of her religion, then that would be discrimination, and the law would step in. So, what's your problem? Under the law, she was treated with all the same protections as everyone else. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Whirled_Peas, Thu 14 May 2009 12:36 PM",

Donald Trump had the right to keep or fire Miss CA because his pageant is a privately-funded enterprise. Perez Hilton (the useless gossipy little bimbo that he is) has the right to have a hissy fit. The news has the right to report on it with whichever perspective it wants. And so on. Why? Because they're private individuals. The GOVERNMENT and the LAW, however, must grant ALL people the same rights, freedoms, and protections. So, were Miss CA and Miss RI treated the same way? Legally, yes, and that's the only issue. In fact, this wasn't an issue of law whatsoever, so the law didn't even get involved. This was all a matter of private business and private citizens' opinions. If Miss CA were to apply for a job and were to be denied the job because of her religion, then that would be discrimination, and the law would step in. So, what's your problem? Under the law, she was treated with all the same protections as everyone else. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Whirled_Peas, Thu 14 May 2009 12:36 PM",
