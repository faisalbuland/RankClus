(Indeed, the Bush administration itself insisted just last year that the U.S. the right to criminally prosecute foreign officials for ordering acts of torture even in the absence of an accusation that any of the victims were American). As Hilzoy argues, however, the primary obligation for these prosecutions lies with the country whose officials authorized the war crimes -- the United States: It is a requirement of law, the law that the Constitution requires Obama, as President, to faithfully execute. He should not outsource his Constitutional obligations to Spain. That the U.S. has the legal obligation under the U.S. Constitution, our own laws and international treaties to commence criminal investigations is simply undeniable. That is just a fact. Yet it's hard to overstate how far away we are from fulfilling our legal obligations to impose accountability on our own torturers and war criminals. The barriers to these prosecutions are numerous, but one of the principal obstacles is that CIA Director Leon Panetta has been emphatically demanding that there be no investigations of any government officials whose conduct was declared legal by DOJ lawyers (i.e., the very individuals the Spanish are now investigating for war crimes). And it's not surprising that Panetta has taken this position given that at least two of his top deputies at the CIA are among those implicated, to one degree or another, in the torture regime, as John Sifton detailed earlier this month at The Daily Beast: The New York Times reported that Leon Panetta, the current CIA director, has taken the position that \u201cno one who took actions based on legal guidance from the Department of Justice at the time should be investigated, let alone punished.\u201d Yet a number of CIA officials implicated in the torture program not only remain at the highest levels of the agency, but are also advising Panetta. Panetta\u2019s attempt to suppress the issue is making Bush\u2019s policy into the Obama administration\u2019s dirty laundry.\" From Glenn Greenwald's blog on Salon.com We are going to find out if we still have a country or not.

The barriers to these prosecutions are numerous, but one of the principal obstacles is that CIA Director Leon Panetta has been emphatically demanding that there be no investigations of any government officials whose conduct was declared legal by DOJ lawyers (i.e., the very individuals the Spanish are now investigating for war crimes). And it's not surprising that Panetta has taken this position given that at least two of his top deputies at the CIA are among those implicated, to one degree or another, in the torture regime, as John Sifton detailed earlier this month at The Daily Beast: The New York Times reported that Leon Panetta, the current CIA director, has taken the position that \u201cno one who took actions based on legal guidance from the Department of Justice at the time should be investigated, let alone punished.\u201d Yet a number of CIA officials implicated in the torture program not only remain at the highest levels of the agency, but are also advising Panetta.

As Hilzoy argues, however, the primary obligation for these prosecutions lies with the country whose officials authorized the war crimes -- the United States: It is a requirement of law, the law that the Constitution requires Obama, as President, to faithfully execute. He should not outsource his Constitutional obligations to Spain. That the U.S. has the legal obligation under the U.S. Constitution, our own laws and international treaties to commence criminal investigations is simply undeniable. That is just a fact. Yet it's hard to overstate how far away we are from fulfilling our legal obligations to impose accountability on our own torturers and war criminals. The barriers to these prosecutions are numerous, but one of the principal obstacles is that CIA Director Leon Panetta has been emphatically demanding that there be no investigations of any government officials whose conduct was declared legal by DOJ lawyers (i.e., the very individuals the Spanish are now investigating for war crimes). And it's not surprising that Panetta has taken this position given that at least two of his top deputies at the CIA are among those implicated, to one degree or another, in the torture regime, as John Sifton detailed earlier this month at The Daily Beast: The New York Times reported that Leon Panetta, the current CIA director, has taken the position that \u201cno one who took actions based on legal guidance from the Department of Justice at the time should be investigated, let alone punished.\u201d Yet a number of CIA officials implicated in the torture program not only remain at the highest levels of the agency, but are also advising Panetta.

The barriers to these prosecutions are numerous, but one of the principal obstacles is that CIA Director Leon Panetta has been emphatically demanding that there be no investigations of any government officials whose conduct was declared legal by DOJ lawyers (i.e., the very individuals the Spanish are now investigating for war crimes). And it's not surprising that Panetta has taken this position given that at least two of his top deputies at the CIA are among those implicated, to one degree or another, in the torture regime, as John Sifton detailed earlier this month at The Daily Beast: The New York Times reported that Leon Panetta, the current CIA director, has taken the position that \u201cno one who took actions based on legal guidance from the Department of Justice at the time should be investigated, let alone punished.\u201d Yet a number of CIA officials implicated in the torture program not only remain at the highest levels of the agency, but are also advising Panetta. Panetta\u2019s attempt to suppress the issue is making Bush\u2019s policy into the Obama administration\u2019s dirty laundry.\" From Glenn Greenwald's blog on Salon.com We are going to find out if we still have a country or not.

The barriers to these prosecutions are numerous, but one of the principal obstacles is that CIA Director Leon Panetta has been emphatically demanding that there be no investigations of any government officials whose conduct was declared legal by DOJ lawyers (i.e., the very individuals the Spanish are now investigating for war crimes). And it's not surprising that Panetta has taken this position given that at least two of his top deputies at the CIA are among those implicated, to one degree or another, in the torture regime, as John Sifton detailed earlier this month at The Daily Beast: The New York Times reported that Leon Panetta, the current CIA director, has taken the position that \u201cno one who took actions based on legal guidance from the Department of Justice at the time should be investigated, let alone punished.\u201d Yet a number of CIA officials implicated in the torture program not only remain at the highest levels of the agency, but are also advising Panetta.

The barriers to these prosecutions are numerous, but one of the principal obstacles is that CIA Director Leon Panetta has been emphatically demanding that there be no investigations of any government officials whose conduct was declared legal by DOJ lawyers (i.e., the very individuals the Spanish are now investigating for war crimes). And it's not surprising that Panetta has taken this position given that at least two of his top deputies at the CIA are among those implicated, to one degree or another, in the torture regime, as John Sifton detailed earlier this month at The Daily Beast: The New York Times reported that Leon Panetta, the current CIA director, has taken the position that \u201cno one who took actions based on legal guidance from the Department of Justice at the time should be investigated, let alone punished.\u201d Yet a number of CIA officials implicated in the torture program not only remain at the highest levels of the agency, but are also advising Panetta.

Sometimes when you are convinced you are right, you have to be willing to be the only one standing in a room full of naysayers. I agree with you in terms of the precedents that could be set. I do not necessarily agree with you that the Bush doctrine regarding Iraq was the \"right thing\". Afghanistan...yes, Iraq, how was that the right thing? The only justification for going to war is \"clear and present danger\", which part of that did Iraq fill? Bare in mind...a clear and present danger to a nation that could wipe all life from the earth 40 times over.",
