Buck up son and break open that wallet of yours and let us know which illegal you gave your job to. Wow...if an immigrant from a third world country stole your job.. LOL....maybe YOU should go to Mexico... I just love it when people say that....\"A dumb immigrant stole my job.\"....lol No one has ever proved immigrants have \"stolen\" any OPPORTUNITY from American citizens...and they never will. The fact they are here ILLEGALLY is the Problem. No one here has anything against immigrants. So? We do not have the resources to enforce that law. Its like welfare recipients who roll around in escalades, not enough people to investigate their actions. Its madness.....but at the end of the day immigrants are not responsible for a single damn thing wrong with America..... It just boggles my mind how anyone seriously blames people with no education for every and any problem here in the states....Its crazy. Besides being here illegally I think many of us object to the diversion of social and economic resources to the illegals. There is a strong perception that the illegals are getting a free ride on everything from education to health care while those footing the bill are heading towards bankruptcy.",

Shall we start to quote Mein Kampf?? People with your viewpoint should bear the brunt of the cost of Illegals, lets have one go take YOUR job and whatever money you have in savings should go to paying their medical bills, no problem right? Bet you really don't think that way Irrrrwin when it's you that has to bear the burden. Don't give us that; you don't mind paying either, I don't beleive it.
