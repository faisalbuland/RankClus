The Kepler spacecraft is scheduled to blast into space on top of a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida just before 11 p.m. ET. \"This is a historical mission. It's not just a science mission,\" NASA Associate Administrator Ed Weiler said during a pre-launch news conference. \"It really attacks some very basic human questions that have been part of our genetic code since that first man or woman looked up in the sky and asked the question: Are we alone?\" Kepler contains a special telescope that will stare at 100,000 stars in the Cygnus-Lyra region of the Milky Way for more than three years as it trails Earth's orbit around the Sun. The spacecraft will look for tiny dips in a star's brightness, which can mean an orbiting planet is passing in front of it -- an event called a transit. Are we alone? \"We won't find E.T., but we might find E.T.'s home,\" said William Borucki, science principal investigator for the Kepler mission. About 330 \"exoplanets\" -- those circling sun-like stars outside the solar system -- have been discovered since the first was confirmed in 1995.
