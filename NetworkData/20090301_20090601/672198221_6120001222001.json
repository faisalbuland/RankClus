We as Americans are supposed to be better than this. What a lot of people are doing is \"disappearing\" the past. How many times on this subject have people on this forum said, \"Show me where it is illegal to torture!\" As if we hadn't had war crimes trials for the Japanese or the Germans (not that they waterboarded). It is as if Stalinism had replaced the American Spirit. It is as if people just want to not think at all. \"Bush is strong, Cheney is strong. That is all I need to know.\" Well, Stalin was strong too, and that is why a lot of Russians still revere him. They don't have the examples of our patriot fathers to illumine their path. What Sam Adams said applies to them: If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude than the animated contest of freedom, go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen!\u201d And there are a LOT of people like that on this forum. Walt",

Walt It's funny that unless something is specifically named as being torture (and NOTHING actually is specifically named) then if we say it's not torture, therefore it isn't. How about the \"Bastinado?\" That's where you tie someone down and whack the soles of their feet. Done properly it leaves no marks. So if the Bush administration used it, and said thjis isn't torture, then by definition it isn't? Ray has his head in the sand on this one. He obviously believes in \"the power of the word.\" Someone said it ain't torture, therefore by definition it can't be torture. Which of couse means that everyone convicted in American Courts should have been pardoned by the President. Dave",

Yes, and for the Office of Legal Counsel in the Executive Branch of our government to okay torture to get confessions throws them back to the Spanish Inquisition, because in this country, torture has always been a no-go.
