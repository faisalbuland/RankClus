My mortgage company requires that I have liability and windstorm. Windstorm alone, with a $6,000 deductible, costs me $2,500 per year above the libility. Yes, my present home insurance cost me $5,350 per year, $445 per month. I have not made a hurricane damage claim or any other type claim in the past 30 years.
