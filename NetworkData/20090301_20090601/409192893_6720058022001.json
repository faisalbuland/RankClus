Article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 prohibits torture of prisoners and Article 32 of the Fourth Geneva Convention similarly protects civilian detainees. The Red Cross' demand for prosecution echoes the call from Ramsey Clark and the IndictBushNow movement: \"Indiscriminate killing of civilians, summary execution, arbitrary seizures of people and property, secret unlimited detention and torture have been authorized and widely practiced.\" We have extraordinary momentum on our side right now and we must seize the moment to make indictment and prosecution a reality. We will be taking out newspaper ads in Europe and in the United States. Please consider taking a moment right now to make a donation to this new movement for the indictment of Bush.

Coming from the Red Cross, this presents a major obstacle to those who would seek to block prosecution or suggest that the conduct carried out by Bush officials and the CIA could be considered lawful by any means.

After all aside from the international law having been broken, Our constitution once again has been violated. What part of the Constitution was violated? When you violate an international treaty you violate our constitution in this case. International Treaty? What part of this treaty was violated and what does that have to do with our Constitution? Article-6 sec-G States that all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land. So in violating an international treaty or agreement the U.S. are signators of, We violate the constitution. Torture is defined in the Geneva convention treaty, and the nuremberg agreements and if our president approved of these methods he violeted the constitution in our name and it was an impeachable offense. Those that carried out those orders are not exempt from prosecution. That was determined at the neuremberg trials when german soldiers claimed they were only following orders. So its really all about the constitution and has nothing to do with the terrorists who I couldnt care less about what they did to them.
