(Sorry you have to excuse my English , it \u2018s seems very clumsy . I leanred myself actually . ) there are hatred actually , but it is taking to far in China . Every race has his tear and laughter in History . It as if seems that the Chinese could not let go of the history . Partly it is since there are tragic things happened in the world war . Partly because the government . Like elsewhere in China , the part not being ruled by commies . Like macau , HK ,and so on . There is no such Japan hating sentiment . I believe the commie government should bare the burden of encouraging such racial hatred . Also I was once under the influence of that Japanese are all psychopath and very crazy killer . If some one tells me that Japanese in nice and so on , maybe I\u2019ll suspect this guy is from planet delusional . Until my uncles family went to Japan for holiday he told me that Japanese people are hospitable and friendly . It really throw me into total confusion . WTF , Japanese is good guys ?? you are CHinese they didnt do those kinda of things ? Until myself visited Japan , and impressed by her awe-inspiring refinement and cleaness .That I have let go of ill-feeling about Japan . And from the internet or many other sources which I known , that depiction of Japanese people is not correct . at least there are many exaggeration by paint a people with opinated brush . But that does not make Japanese a saint , surely , Japanese as a people has vice too just like anybody . I tell you a real story , I am honest about this one . I had posted many essay on internet , non of them has anything to with Japan hating . Instead I have posted many essay of introducing Japanese to Chinese , something like analysis of Japanese temperament , and so on , and many others like detect the soul of Chinese , what makes German people so special , and so on . There is a Japanese made contact to me via internet fashion , he ask me to shove up my azz , or die . His intention is clear , it is better letting Chinese live in a jungle savage condition rather than enlighten people . Actually , from my examnation , Chinese is not inherently azzhole although many of them when they grow up , they turn into arrant azzhole , but when you exam the 4 year old or 5 year old Chinese kid alone with the children of other races . You do not find too much difference , My conclusion is that , Chinese is not born azzhole , at least not in the fashion they genetically carries aszhole DNA . In fact , there is no inherent azzhole in the world , it is their culture that eroded their soul . each man \u2018s personality is shaped by environment or his destiny . no one is born to be an azzhole. That Japanese azzhole is funny , he did a lots of behind scences things , his motive is very clear. Like story in an ancient history . We are a advanced nation , our neibourgh , is an primitive tribe , they are backward yet they have the potential . Their hope is the wise old man live among them who will guide them to enlightment . But , if we , we do not touch anybody, except that we eradicated all their wise old man among them , we will manage to keep them permently in the dark . What ever the case , it is wise let them survive in a condition of jungle savage than modern and civilized manner . I think you get what I mean . I am not telling you a lie man , it did happened to me . And this guy he want to further his case by claim sending threat letter in the future . Maybe some threatening words with bullets knives all that . This azzhole actually thinks I said too much on internet and that is not good for his dreams . Right now , I live in Melbourne City in Australia , this Azzhole also lives here and works in SBS as a subtitler , we have a multi-national television station here , it is called SBS . When he send his threat letter , I will scan it and post here . ( maybe he just another cowards only bark but does not byte ) , if he ever going to send one , I will post here to let you guys see . Maybe bring one to the Japanese embassy as well not to mention the police station . So the Japanese after all is not that ( good ) , at least not all the Japanese are that ( good) . There are azzholes from Japan too , just like many of them in China . Yeah , I was receiving death threat from Japanese personally and yet I do no really hate them ,",
