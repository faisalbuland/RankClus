Prepared by Chosen, 18echo, seebee, oneriotone and semper fi Marbleheaders Northwest *This pamphlet is freely distributable in its current configuration with proper attribution. Of course we are in dire straits, this is something we all need no lecture of. So this proposition is a set of tangible Liberty agitations and steps to be taken as a whole or in modified pieces to achieve our goals. The first step is small scale organization. 1. Create Liberty meetings. Get a group of friends together and not only discuss Liberty and specific issues, create a to-do list. The idea here is to build camaraderie. This is important and will distinguish your protests from the run of the mill empty sign wavings. You will come to depend on your brothers and sisters when things get heated. Consider advocating a uniformed message. Keep the meeting flowing and not too long. The end of the Liberty meetings should leave folks wanting for another. Avoid partisanship and denounce both parties equally. At this meeting establish a quick contact system for all attendees, this would be an email alert system, twitter etc. The meeting organizer should have access to all available technologies and be proficient in their usage, so as to facilitate any means of communication to any Liberty meeting attendee. At these meeting is where the protests will be formed. The folks who attend will compromise the core of the protesters who may show up at phase 2. Keep protest or action goals very small and tangible, do not have lofty non-practical goals. For example, a goal could be to canvass a parking lot at some government offices with a flyer. Tangible goal, means of achieving goal, action and MOST importantly after action meeting. This is important because the Liberty meeting coordinator must obtain information as to what worked, what didn't and why. Efficiency of message and its DELIVERY is paramount. This also allows for participants to give their experiences. The Liberty meeting coordinator must allow for all the participants to share their concerns, ideas and experiences. At this after action meeting speak briefly of the nest Liberty meeting only. Contact those on the contact list and speak of the achievements (of course if you spray painted a picture of Sam Adams on the head of the DNC/GOP's Lexus, you may wish to keep this quiet). The idea is to get others involved and active. Keep these actions constant and small. People will participate more and more as news of the achievements catches on. Do not worry about the quality or amount of news coverage, it doesn't matter, you are not going to get a fair shake regardless of what you do. The media is part of the oligarchy, expecting praise or fair reporting will result in disappointment. It would be like expecting the Soviet run TV stations to honor the Budapest resistance after Soviet occupation of Hungary, won't happen. Consider creating a blog (unassociated) with your Liberty group that reports on Liberty activities. Technical requirements... Liberty Meeting Location. Meet on private land or property if at all possible. This will afford you the direct capability of protection and ability to thwart disrupters or pro-authoritarian protesters. You should know that there are professional, paid individuals who do nothing but disrupt organizations and cause dismay. If you are on private land you can easily and justly have them removed, they will not be able to say \"I have a right to be here,\" because you have a right to remove them if need be. If you cannot meet on private land, meet in rented space or something equivalent where you can still exercise private rights. Disruption really won't be a problem most of the time, not until you become effective. If you chose to do an action, which is better than a protest, consider using it to thematically lead up to a protest. If you chose to do a protest... As for how to organize the protest the Brendan Steinhauser list is best: 1. Pick a location, date and time in your town. I\u2019d suggest main street at an intersection with lots of traffic. 2. Tell your friends, family, co-workers and everyone else you know about the protest. Build an rsvp email list so that you can provide quick updates if something changes. You should also create a facebook group so that the group can communicate with one another. 3. Make 5-10 signs with legible slogans that send a clear message to the public and the media. Write in BIG LETTERS. 4. Call your local talk radio hosts and ask them to announce the location, date and time on the air for a few days leading up to the protest. Send a letter to the editor of your local newspaper announcing the protest. Email the bloggers in your area and ask them to post a notice about the protest. 5. Write a press release and email, mail and fax copies to the local tv stations, radio stations and newspapers. Call the reporters that cover local events or politics and leave messages on their voice mail. 6. On the day of your protest, show up with your group, be loud, visible, happy and engage the public. Wave your signs, make lots of noise and move around to get attention. If reporters interview you, give them some good sound bytes for their stories. Stay on message and keep your answers short and coherent. 7. Bring sign-in sheets to capture the names, emails and phone numbers of everyone who attends the protest and/or says that they support what you are doing. You will then have a big list of people that can plan the next, much bigger and louder, event. Also bring handouts with one page of quick facts about why you are protesting in the first place. 8. Add your pictures, video and an after-action report to your facebook group, and send this stuff to the bloggers and reporters that you originally contacted. Ask them to post the photos, story and video. 9. Thank everyone who attended via email and phone, and set up a meeting to plan your next event. Now you have a list of people in your community that can help make the next protest huge. Encourage everyone to commit to bring at least one friend to the next protest. 10. Organize a carpool and go find a friend in your neighboring town or county and help them organize a protest there. You and your people are now veterans and should be able to keep the momentum going around your area. 11. PREPARE RETORTS to all possible anti-protestor quips. Positions these retort specialists around your protest evenly. Suggestions are that you ensure that the protest is non-partisan. Have signs that speak to linking Bush and Obama in the same camp. If the GOP takes possession of the protests, as they are trying to do since they have completely failed as a party, you will ultimately fail and be lumped into the category of Republicans. Be very careful, as I know folks who are still in the GOP, they survived the Conservative amnesty purges, who state that the remaining GOP wants the protests to ultimately fail, but to step in when they do and offer the participants a means of continuing the \"struggle\" with them. Be overt about this, you have to. You will find the attacking the GOP wll awaken the masses of disaffected folks who feel betrayed by them, especially TRUE conservatives. You will also gain the help of independent populists. Whatever message you come up with at the Liberty meeting stick with it, make sure folks participate and they are heard. Consider being very, very specific with the protests, broad protests get watered down. Direct and covert action is always superior. Create a buzz. \"Who keeps spray painting a template of Samuel Adams, with the words Join or Die on buildings and on public property?\" The best thing you could ever hope for is having police look for the vandals. Beware the freeper/rino naysayer. There are a ton of leftpublicans who will try and destroy your protest. Do whatever you need to do to prevent this. Anything, because they are scum, haters of Liberty and democrats in elephants clothing. They will present themselves as moral \"middle of the road\" paladins, in reality this simply do not want you to succeed. They actually like the path the country is taking, they just wished McCain, or someone like this, was the steersman. Remember protests without covert actions are useless. The covert actions will actually make the protests stronger and more impactful. For those who do not like seeing a mock up of an IRS man hanging from a rope in their town square (see Sons of Liberty 1770's for examples) this will make the message of the protests successful. Make it your goal to make a small Liberty group in the next two weeks. Numbers don't matter. As a methodology, do not be too labored down by symbology and group name. The most effective method is to create a group do some actions/protests, then disband and reform under a different title (same message). Do not elect leadership, just have an organizer. Be very clear, small and tangible in your goals. Weed out the authoritarians and anarchists at your Liberty meetings. You can broadly advertise them or use word of mouth, it is up to you. Be willing to walk away from the group if need be and form another one (with the same like minded folks if need be), just do not dismantle if you have not taken an action or protest or two under you belts. Subversion of tyranny is ecstasy. Oooorahh. This message has been edited. Last edited by: <NEMESIS1960>, Mon 06 April 2009 02:35 PM",
