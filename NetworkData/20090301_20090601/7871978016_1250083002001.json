Part of Japan's entire reasoning in the Pacific War was that they were racially superior. It isn't taught in schools today, but they considered themselves to be more highly evolved (which is the root of all modern genocide) and therefore less succeptible to the faults of others such as body odor (I'm not making this up). The Chinese have a racial superiority complex and it is sure to come to the fore when we fight them. If we don't stop hating ourselves then we are giving them a helping hand. Also considering that they are atheists, it would stand to reason that they have a sincere NEED to prove themselves the masters of the world, and will kill as many people as necessary to make the point. A good comparison is the Alamo: There were actually a few ethnic Mexicans who fought alongside the rest of the Anglo defenders. Santa Anna put entire villages of people to the sword on the way to San Antonio as a measure of his revenge. The Chinese Generals have promised to do the same with the 'corrupted' Chinese (and other races) that live in America. They either realize what will happen to them and help or we should throw them outside the gate, but I will waste no time trying to reason with people who would invite their own destruction. Part of standing up means throwing off the burden of white guilt that the Chinese certainly know of and will exploit, just as the Soviets did.",

Kim Jong Un speaks English, likes basketball \u2014 and is said to look and act just like his father. (...) Kim Jong Il has allowed no opposition, raising concerns about a power struggle if he dies suddenly without naming a successor. The eccentric leader has three known sons by two women. The oldest, Kim Jong Nam, was long considered his favorite \u2014 until he tried to sneak into Japan using a fake Dominican passport and visit Tokyo's Disney resort in 2001. The middle son, Kim Jong Chol, apparently has never been a favorite as a possible leader. Kim Jong Il's former sushi chef says in a 2003 memoir that the leader considers his second son \"girlish.\" But talk about the youngest son has been growing. On Sunday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Kim Jong Un was assigned to a low-level post at the defense commission, the top government body, several days before his father was reappointed as the commission's chairman on April 9. That reappointment marked the first major public appearance for the \"Dear Leader\" after his reported stroke. He was gaunter, grayer. (...) Little is known about Kim Jong Un. The former sushi chef, Kenji Fujimoto, says in his memoir that the son looks and acts just like his father. The teen studied at the International School of Bern in Switzerland, a short walk from the North Korean embassy, where classes are taught in English and many students come from diplomatic families. A recent article in the French-speaking weekly L'Hebdo described Kim Jong Un as a shy student enrolled under the name of Chol Pak, who enjoyed team sports like basketball, went skiing with friends on Fridays and admired Michael Jordan and Jean-Claude Van Damme. (...) Kim Jong Il believes his youngest son has \"charismatic leadership\" like him, said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the security think tank Sejong Institute. Cheong said Kim Jong Il's health problems would speed up his naming an heir. But Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, disagreed, saying Kim Jong Il is believed to be focusing more on consolidating his support base rather than appointing his successor, which would quickly erode his power and \"worsen his health condition.\" (...)",
