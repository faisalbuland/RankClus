However, He said it was because of being dehydrated or something with too much protein. I was away for a week and that whole time he was working out and consuming alcohol. I believe him that he didn't abuse any drugs due to the fact that he was prior service and desperately wants to get back in. My father on the other hand who was in the Navy for fifteen years says that he was definitely doing drugs because my fiance use to abuse cocaine when I met him a little more than two years ago. He quit when we started dating and has been clean ever since. Please tell me that there are ways to fail a drug test other than using drugs or consuming poppy seeds. Thank You.",
