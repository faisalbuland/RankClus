You have to focus with a certain intention on your humanoid interior until you find that side. It's reported to give a tremendous feeling. Compare it to a human being, who has a lot of simian DNA. A human may have almost 99 % DNA of that of a chimpansee. As a result his body has a lot of hair, not to mention a host of other characterial traits. He should not behave accordingly. The same goes for a reptilian, who is more than the small amount of DNA that comes from a reptilian animal.",
