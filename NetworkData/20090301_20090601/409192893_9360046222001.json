Let me play \"Devil's Advocate\": In the period immediately preceding the American Civil War (and during that War), a segment of American society read, from the King James translation of the Bible, Genesis, Chapter 9, verses 18-27: quote: [18] And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. [19] These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. [20] And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: [21] And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. [22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. [23] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. [24] And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. [25] And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. [26] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. [27] God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. Various Godly, Christian ministers whose churchmembers came from this segment of society, residing primarily in the Southern States, interpreted and taught from their pulpits that Blacks were the decendants of Ham and Canaan and therefore their slavery to Whites (the decendants of Japeth and Shem) was sanctioned by God. These ministers and their churches split from their fellow Baptists and became the Southern Baptist Convention. So, some Godly, Christian people will take the position that God abandoned the United States when it ended Black slavery, in defiance of what they believe is God's will. In my opinion as a Christian and as an American, I believe God has no greater concern or lesser concern about the government of the United States than God has about the governments of Kenya, Bolivia, Uzbekistan or the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In His eyes, everyone born on this Earth is equal, regardless of which nation they were accidentaly born into.",

It's the fact that they don't expand on that vague \"Creator\" talk that is interesting.

Let me play \"Devil's Advocate\": In the period immediately preceding the American Civil War (and during that War), a segment of American society read, from the King James translation of the Bible, Genesis, Chapter 9, verses 18-27: quote: [18] And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. [19] These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. [20] And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: [21] And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. [22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. [23] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. [24] And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. [25] And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. [26] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. [27] God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. Various Godly, Christian ministers whose churchmembers came from this segment of society, residing primarily in the Southern States, interpreted and taught from their pulpits that Blacks were the decendants of Ham and Canaan and therefore their slavery to Whites (the decendants of Japeth and Shem) was sanctioned by God. These ministers and their churches split from their fellow Baptists and became the Southern Baptist Convention. So, some Godly, Christian people will take the position that God abandoned the United States when it ended Black slavery, in defiance of what they believe is God's will. In my opinion as a Christian and as an American, I believe God has no greater concern or lesser concern about the government of the United States than God has about the governments of Kenya, Bolivia, Uzbekistan or the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

These ministers and their churches split from their fellow Baptists and became the Southern Baptist Convention. So, some Godly, Christian people will take the position that God abandoned the United States when it ended Black slavery, in defiance of what they believe is God's will. In my opinion as a Christian and as an American, I believe God has no greater concern or lesser concern about the government of the United States than God has about the governments of Kenya, Bolivia, Uzbekistan or the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In His eyes, everyone born on this Earth is equal, regardless of which nation they were accidentaly born into. This I think is slightly off of my thought process. I know what the bible says and I know that slavery is defended/evil in the bible. My thinking mainly stems from Pres Lincoln. He basically was the one who caused a civil war over the thinking that slavery is evil. He did not start the war for this I understand but his thinking was always aligned that way so it seems from what I can read about him (reading HIS words). He then took refuge in his heart that God would be on the Unions side to see us through to victory. Meanwhile many many members in congress were speaking of entering into talks with the South along with sections of the media. So Lincoln kept his strength in conviction because of God. The Creator being used in the Declaration is using what the term meant in 1776. The Creator was God to the vast majority of Congressmen who wrote/signed that document and the constitution. So. If no belief in God in Government, Abe would very possibly not been able to pursue the war as determinedly as he did.",

For the most part, our Founders were not overly religious individuals. One need only read their letters, their writings to ascertain this simple fact. They were intelligent enough to realize invoking a belief in a deity was required under the conditions that existed at the time of our Founding. Regardless of whether they did, or not was not the guiding principle that led to our Revolution.

Amazingly, we are critical of other nations that envoke religious doctrine as part of their political process. We denounce many countries for allowing religion to influence their destiny, and in fact, we feel obligated to change such a system simply because we are arrogant enough to believe our religious doctrine, the Christian doctrine is somehow dominant to other religious doctrine. History is littered with failed nations that relied on religious doctrine as their political guiding principles. America is no different, and the majority of American's are questioning the wisdom of allowing religious doctrine, no matter the religion to dictate political realities. S/F Gordon",

For the most part, our Founders were not overly religious individuals. One need only read their letters, their writings to ascertain this simple fact. They were intelligent enough to realize invoking a belief in a deity was required under the conditions that existed at the time of our Founding. Regardless of whether they did, or not was not the guiding principle that led to our Revolution.

Does it mean that the Founding Fathers asked God for wisdom, or that God truly did bless America, or does it mean something else? My own thought is that there are dozens of societies and countries which have existed for a much longer time than America, many have prospered too. Often times the majority of the people in these countries are not Christian or don't have the same level of religious fervor as we do. This is the first successful country started where mankind chose his own rule of government. Other countries as you call successful have been ruled by soooo many types of government from dictators, kings, warlords, to peaceful benefactors who have the ultimate say on and on. They were/are successful in their own right but this country is ruled by the people (republic). We do not have a dictator cutting off our heads if we dis-agree. We do not have kids turning in parents on a mass scale to the government. We are people who vote our office holders in or out. We are successful because of our type of government AND its' people. Our Government was formed from existing laws from many countries and religion. So I just reflect on the circumstances Lincoln had to face without God in the mix. I cannot see us getting rid of slavery without it. Not saying it couldn\u2019t happen but it would take a lot longer. You need to get some more education about things outside the US. Here are a few examples * in 930AD in Iceland a constitution creating a form of democracy was created. The Icelandic Althing is the world's oldest practicing legislative assembly. Last I checked 930AD was BEFORE the US was established * Then there were governments such as that of the Iroquois league (est. before 1600AD) which was a MAJOR source for how the US government was organized. * If you take into account how the vote was originally restricted in the US then Athens is also an example of elected representative government and it was a few years before the US was established as well. I'd dispute that Athens was a representative government in the modern sense, they only really elected officials (and even then all but the strategoi (generals) were elected by lot) and a sort of simple executive (also a lottery). Policy decisions were for the most part made by the citizenry as a whole at regular meetings - they pretty much had referenda on everything.",
