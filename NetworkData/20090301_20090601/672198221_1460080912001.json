I have never understood why people want to punish people because they make more. Well I only make 50K so I should only have a 15% tax (7,500 in taxes) 42,500 still in money. You don't lose any money, but your willing to take someone who makes 100K pay 35k in taxes. They went to college and got there Masters or PHDs.

I worked hard to get where I am at to include living paycheck to paycheck, making minimum wage in menial BS positions, food stamps, etc. I pay a lot in taxes and work, on average, 55+ hours a week.

I have never understood why people want to punish people because they make more. Well I only make 50K so I should only have a 15% tax (7,500 in taxes) 42,500 still in money. You don't lose any money, but your willing to take someone who makes 100K pay 35k in taxes. They went to college and got there Masters or PHDs.

The Republican Plan as Conservative commentator David Brooks says, \"Is a joke.\" And indeed it is. First off, what IS a tax credit for the average American? If they didn't pay any taxes at all, they couldn't afford the premiums. Second point, taxes are being cut to 95 percent of Americans, and the tax structure for the wealthy is simply going back to pre-Bush days.

I also do believe that under this new administration we are going to borrow too much and it isn't going to help. Here's a question for you; if we give a substantial tax cut for the middle-class and a huge tax cut tax cut for the wealthy, how do we fund government? All this does is make the rich richer, nothing new there. As to health care, I saw nothing about universal health care, you can quite worring. What I saw as \"incentives\" to assist the uninsured to buy health insurance. If it is similar to their earlier proposal of a $6,000. tax credit for healthcare IMHO it won't work. Show me an insurance company that will provide descent healthcare coverage to a family of four for $500 / month. Don't give a huge tax to the wealthy. Make is a proportional tax. The more you make the more you pay in taxes. How does it make the rich wealthier? It says tax-cuts for the working class families and small businesses. Didn't see big business or wealthy in there. Here is the universal health care on page 2 on the right: \"Instead of accelerating the demise of our nation\u2019s large entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and creating new unsustainable entitlements, Republicans seek to provide universal access to affordable health care and to address our entitlements\u2019 trillion dollar unfunded liabilities with common-sense reforms that ensure our children and grandchildren can secure future benefits.\" It provides universal access to affordable health care. I guess that is a good thing so everyone can have it, but don't like UNIVERSAL. Just affordable health care would work for me. I don't know about 500 a month for a family, but my wife and I have our own health insurance provided by our work. She has hers and I have mine. Cheap. The tax rate for those earning more than $100,000/year would be 25%. The current rate is aprox 35%...that's a 10 point tax cut for the rich. Its not universal healthcare if you still have to buy it (ie. unemployed, underemployed). There is nothing in the solutions that says 100,000 would be 25%. So if your making 100,000 your actually only getting 75K versus 35% where your only getting 65K. That doesn't seem fair. I still like a proportional tax. I have never understood why people want to punish people because they make more. Well I only make 50K so I should only have a 15% tax (7,500 in taxes) 42,500 still in money. You don't lose any money, but your willing to take someone who makes 100K pay 35k in taxes. They went to college and got there Masters or PHDs. I'm sure they aren't paid off, but why give them a chance to pay it off or give them a chance to live the lifestyle they have earned. A proportional tax would solve your worries. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

I pay a toll on many of the highways. Nor can I \"write these off\" as a buisness expense. Without this infrastructure these companies would plain and simple, be out of buisness. Now in todays world, a modern infrastructure, a modern rail system is a necessity for a country like ours - So, if we want to stay a First World country - Who exactely is going to pay for the above? Me? You want to raise tolls, gasoline taxes, mass transit fees to the point where my disposable income creeps down to zero?

Right now the US is second in corporate tax rate (by 0.5% less than Japan, IIRC). Airlines and air freight companies pay landing fees. Ships pay port tax. Seems to me the companies are already paying what you suggest.", 
        "reply": " I pay a MUCH higher proportion of my disposable income for road taxes then do these corporations. I pay a tax everytime I gas up. I pay a toll on many of the highways. Nor can I \"write these off\" as a buisness expense. Without this infrastructure these companies would plain and simple, be out of buisness. Now in todays world, a modern infrastructure, a modern rail system is a necessity for a country like ours - So, if we want to stay a First World country - Who exactely is going to pay for the above? Me? You want to raise tolls, gasoline taxes, mass transit fees to the point where my disposable income creeps down to zero? Back when Adam Smith, the Father of Capitalism, wrote the \"Wealth of Nations\" he pointed these contradictions out, and called taxing the Middle Income Middle Class (99 percent of those who post on this board) \"criminal.\" He said this for the obvious reason that Old Doc and others stated - The wealthy reap most of the benefits and should pay most of the cost. It's still criminal. Dave",

I don't hear anyone whining about Reagan, Eisenhower or Nixon having been a socialist even though they taxed the wealthiest at a higher rate than the supposedly socialist Obama? Why's that? Oh yeah, they were Republicans. And, the truth is Obama's plan cuts taxes for 95% of working Americans. Further, it closes huge tax loopholes for oil companies, hedge funds and corporations that ship jobs overseas so that we can invest in the priorities that will get our economy back on track. What do Republicans say to this? Boo, hiss. We only care about the wealthiest. GOP = Grand OBSTRUCTIONIST Party.",
