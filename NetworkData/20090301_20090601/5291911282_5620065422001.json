Join my Dollar Challenge! it\u2019s so Simple\u2026 1) Click on my link [\"\"\"\"\"url=http://pages.teamintraining.org/los/wildtri09/btoomey]http://pages.teamintraining.org/los/wildtri09/btoomey[/url] 2) donate one dollar ($1) to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. 3) Pass it on to all of your friends and challenge them to do the same. Ask them to keep passing it on after they donate. 4) See that with just $1.00 we can all make a difference, save lives and find a cure. Here\u2019s how it works: $1.00 x my 100 friends (yes I have 100 friends--ha ha) = $100 Now, if my 100 friends have 100 friends each that would be\u2026.$10,000 for a total $10,100\u2026and it keeps getting passed on and on and on! See how this can work to wipe out cancer! Please Please Please Please help me! If you are like me I am looking at this math problem and thinking how can it be this easy\u2026. Did I do the math wrong? I did go to school and I don't love math... But the numbers are right and we can all make a difference! I'll be competing in a triathlon to support all of those who have had to fight the \"C Word\" aka cancer. I don't know about you, but I've had too many friends affected by cancer and I just stood by not knowing what I could really do to help. For some reason, I decided 2009 was the year that I was going to step up. I guess when things like the economy and depressing news started invading my life everyday, I decided it was going to be up to us regular people to take control. Believe it or not, collectively we can make a difference. Anyway, thank you for your support! Sorry, no hot links allowed here. MD This message has been edited.
