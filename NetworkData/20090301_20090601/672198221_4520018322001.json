Anyway, I think she did not help her mother, she should just be humble, hush up and stay off the tv as should her ex. Sarah doesn't need her help. Bristol is a teenager who thought she fell in love and let the nasty happen with a little POS. She was a naive, innocent girl before she made the god awful mistake you people condemn her for. What a sinner! Cast the girl into hell and get it over with. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Only a bunch of pathetic excuses for adults with nothing better to do, would talk crap about a young girl. Nice job. Leave her alone for god sakes. She is doing the right thing by trying to be a mother to her child. Of course it is hard for her to care for a newborn and deal with the left's vicious hatred at the same time. Thank God she has her family. Why don't you all get off your high horses and talk about something worthwhile. well... how is it that he is a \"POS\"? and what is \"nasty\" about sex? he, like she, were thrust into the public eye and paraded across the media like some sort of annomaly. he is no diffrent than any TEENAGED boy. was he supposed to marry her? be a daddy? i think he has a great responsability, since the child is his too, but a lifetime of anger, and harsh feelings between those two would have made the raising of the baby secondary to their spite for each other. after that whole press thing, they are BOTH shy and shell shocked. it is no surprise to me that he ran, and ran as fast as his legs could carry him. and better he ran now, that whan the child was old enough to remember. i think you judge the boy harshly.(because that is what he is proving to be) Maybe he'll man up and take responsability, or Maybe he'll remain hidden. time will tell. tis is not a \"leftist\" thing. it is a \"stupid\" thing thatis being discussed This message has been edited.
