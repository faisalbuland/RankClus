As we all know the auto industry has faultered quite a bite and has taken it's toll on my company. In fact, I tried to hang on as long as I could but I had to shut the company down. Because we struggled for such a long time I couldn't afford to pay into unemployment. Now that has me on the brink of homelessness. My question is, is there any compensation or benefits for situations like this or am I sol? Please, any advice is highly appreciated.",
