I don't sleep well anymore, plus we got all these animals to take care of. So, I am going to shampoo the carpet and re-arrange the furniture, lol. Anyway, back to the thread,,,,, Dennis said he might carry his gas mask with him to fly out there. I told him, he just might go to jail too for wearing it. Then he said, he will get a small mask at walmart, the kind painters wear. I hope he doesn't get sick though.",

Several hours in an aluminum tube breathing recycled air that has already been breathed by everyone else on the plane ... EW! And I'm going back to DC for a TDY in mid-May, so I'm sort of stuck, too. Back in the days of SARS, I did a fair amount of international traveling, and always had to fill out a questionnaire about health status upon landing. I don't know how successful it was, since it was easy to lie and who would know? but SARS never became the pandemic some predicted. Even so, SOME illness WILL become pandemic sooner or later.",
