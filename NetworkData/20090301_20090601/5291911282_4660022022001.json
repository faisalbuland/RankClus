He's got a dirty old cap that says \"Vietnam Vet\" with a picture of a Huey on it. On his jacket is the Black Horse patch of the 11th ACR. \"Aw hell no.\" I thought. No Blackhorse brother's gonna ride the bus on my watch. So I turned around and pulled up to the bus stop. \"Hey, Blackhorse!\" He looked up a bit surprised. \"Yeah?\" \"You need a ride?\" About this time he noticed the Blackhorse sticker on my back window. \"Thanks, but I'm going to Fullerton.\" He said. \"Get in, that's where I'm going too.\" I lied. I drove him all the way home. It's the least I could do. Born '44, Vietnam '65, '68, '70 Staff Sergeant Joe Vela told me a little about himself on the way home. Sixty-five years old and he was still finishing concrete for a living. Construction times are tough. Truck broke down, he was riding the bus to work and back home to his trailer. He was proud of the fact he'd been the first Mexican to play on the Huntington Beach All Star basketball team. About our service in the 11th Cav he said, \"Teach them young guys. You old sarge's is all they got.\" He shook my hand about six times. I told him I was honered to make his aquaintance. Gave him my number, he gave me his. We're set to have a beer down at the Corner Pocket when I get back from the stan.",

In 1945 he'd led a platoon of five M5 Stuart light tanks across the Ludendorf Bridge at Remagen Germany on the day they took it, and finally crossed the Rhine. You can't even value exposure to experience like that. It's priceless and he deigned to relate his story to me. Just some obscure nobody.

I know not all the guys with the signs that say help a vet are vets but he just might be and I always give a few bucks How about doing this instead of handing out money without any knowledge of this person or their past. Offer to take the individual to the federal bldg. or a Veterans Service Officer at some Military related service organization to obtain a copy of their DD-214 and sign up for some services, then to the nearest VA hospital to get signed up for some kind of medical care. After that take them to the canteen and fill them up with all they can eat. Get their phone number/address so you can follow up and get them the care they really need, because if you don't follow up then your efforts are all for naught. Interesting to note if you do this enough, you will find more people confessing that they were never in the military that it was a desperate attempt to connive money from unsuspecting and sympathetic Vets. Helping Veterans in need of help is more than just giving a handout. If that Vet is distressed and depressed then your just feeding the monster inside that Vet. He may just go and drink himself into a stupor because he had the money in his pocket and was feeling good about a short encounter. He may feel even more depressed because he got a handout and has had to suppress his pride to survive. If you follow through with that Vet and make sure their getting the help they need then that is something to really be proud of. These short encounters are great and do help a few Vets in Dire Straits, but the majority of those Vets need the follow-up kind of friend that will make sure they make it to the appointments and fill out the paperwork and send it back in. I love to hear the stories of these encounters and feel good for the people who feel some achievement with their short encounter. It sure makes us feel good to know that we have helped another Vet and I don't want to take that away from anyone. About five or six years ago I found a Vet that was at the end literally sitting in a bus stop hoping that some bus driver would let him on for free and take him the last mile up the steep hill to the Portland Oregon VA Hospital. I paid his fare, We spoke on the bus about his unit, which was the 196th Light Infantry Brigade. I was choked at this point because it was my own Brothers unit in Vietnam. I took him into the Emergency room and said some key phrases and the man was \"in like flint\". They took him into the wards and I followed up two days later with a visit to the ward. What followed was a heartfelt thank you from a Vet. I followed up again later when I met him in the main lobby of the hospital and he told me about how good everything was going for him. The truth is there are Vets on the streets and in the woods who have decided that they no longer want to be \"on the grid\" and they wander aimlessly from city/forest to city/forest. Occasionally they find good work and then move on. Sadly there are going to be more Vets on the streets because of the Recent wars and conflicts. SO will you just give them a few dollars once in awhile when you see them or will you say \"Hey Brother let me help you\" and care enough to follow through and make sure they get help they need. No disrespect intended towards anyone in this thread. It's more of a heartfelt attempt to help people realize that helping Vets is more than just a handout.

He's got a dirty old cap that says \"Vietnam Vet\" with a picture of a Huey on it. On his jacket is the Black Horse patch of the 11th ACR. \"Aw hell no.\" I thought. No Blackhorse brother's gonna ride the bus on my watch. So I turned around and pulled up to the bus stop. \"Hey, Blackhorse!\" He looked up a bit surprised. \"Yeah?\" \"You need a ride?\" About this time he noticed the Blackhorse sticker on my back window. \"Thanks, but I'm going to Fullerton.\" He said. \"Get in, that's where I'm going too.\" I lied. I drove him all the way home. It's the least I could do. Born '44, Vietnam '65, '68, '70 Staff Sergeant Joe Vela told me a little about himself on the way home. Sixty-five years old and he was still finishing concrete for a living. Construction times are tough. Truck broke down, he was riding the bus to work and back home to his trailer. He was proud of the fact he'd been the first Mexican to play on the Huntington Beach All Star basketball team. About our service in the 11th Cav he said, \"Teach them young guys. You old sarge's is all they got.\" He shook my hand about six times. I told him I was honered to make his aquaintance. Gave him my number, he gave me his.

        "reply": "So I'm driving south on Magnolia blvd in Anaheim today. I look to my right and across the street is an old guy, sitting in a bus stop with a tool bag waiting for the bus. He's got a dirty old cap that says \"Vietnam Vet\" with a picture of a Huey on it. On his jacket is the Black Horse patch of the 11th ACR. \"Aw hell no.\" I thought. No Blackhorse brother's gonna ride the bus on my watch.

I know not all the guys with the signs that say help a vet are vets but he just might be and I always give a few bucks How about doing this instead of handing out money without any knowledge of this person or their past. Offer to take the individual to the federal bldg. or a Veterans Service Officer at some Military related service organization to obtain a copy of their DD-214 and sign up for some services, then to the nearest VA hospital to get signed up for some kind of medical care. After that take them to the canteen and fill them up with all they can eat. Get their phone number/address so you can follow up and get them the care they really need, because if you don't follow up then your efforts are all for naught. Interesting to note if you do this enough, you will find more people confessing that they were never in the military that it was a desperate attempt to connive money from unsuspecting and sympathetic Vets. Helping Veterans in need of help is more than just giving a handout. If that Vet is distressed and depressed then your just feeding the monster inside that Vet. He may just go and drink himself into a stupor because he had the money in his pocket and was feeling good about a short encounter. He may feel even more depressed because he got a handout and has had to suppress his pride to survive. If you follow through with that Vet and make sure their getting the help they need then that is something to really be proud of. These short encounters are great and do help a few Vets in Dire Straits, but the majority of those Vets need the follow-up kind of friend that will make sure they make it to the appointments and fill out the paperwork and send it back in. I love to hear the stories of these encounters and feel good for the people who feel some achievement with their short encounter. It sure makes us feel good to know that we have helped another Vet and I don't want to take that away from anyone. About five or six years ago I found a Vet that was at the end literally sitting in a bus stop hoping that some bus driver would let him on for free and take him the last mile up the steep hill to the Portland Oregon VA Hospital. I paid his fare, We spoke on the bus about his unit, which was the 196th Light Infantry Brigade. I was choked at this point because it was my own Brothers unit in Vietnam. I took him into the Emergency room and said some key phrases and the man was \"in like flint\". They took him into the wards and I followed up two days later with a visit to the ward. What followed was a heartfelt thank you from a Vet. I followed up again later when I met him in the main lobby of the hospital and he told me about how good everything was going for him. The truth is there are Vets on the streets and in the woods who have decided that they no longer want to be \"on the grid\" and they wander aimlessly from city/forest to city/forest. Occasionally they find good work and then move on. Sadly there are going to be more Vets on the streets because of the Recent wars and conflicts. SO will you just give them a few dollars once in awhile when you see them or will you say \"Hey Brother let me help you\" and care enough to follow through and make sure they get help they need. No disrespect intended towards anyone in this thread. It's more of a heartfelt attempt to help people realize that helping Vets is more than just a handout.
