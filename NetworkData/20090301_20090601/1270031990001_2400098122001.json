Putnam has been the pastor at the Pentecostals of Sheboygan County since 2006. Putnam got into trouble after he came into the police department with a loaded Glock handgun. It happened after he was brought into the police station for questioning about a suicidal parishioner. Putnam wore full body armor to the interview and brought the handgun. Police say Putnam told officers he was authorized to wear the body armor and carry the gun because of his job as Chaplain for the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Department. The District Attorney charged Putnam with carrying a concealed weapon for that incident. The Sheboygan County Sheriff's Department confirms that Putnam is their Chaplain, and that he was given body armor for when he rides along with deputies. But they tell us he is not allowed to carry a gun. Putnam now faces up to nine months behind bars. This isn't the first time Putnam has been in trouble. Last month he received a municipal citation for allowing a parishioner to shoot a bow and arrow inside the church during a sermon. Parishioners say he's just misunderstood. \"I think people who want to know Pastor John Putnam should come and talk to John Putnam, before they form an opinion about him,\" parishioner Terry Koch said. Putnam's attorney said he is: \"A well respected member of the community\" and \"there are facts and circumstances that have not been heard in the case.\" Putnam continues to preach while out on bail. He was ordered not to possess any weapons. 'http://www.620wtmj.com/news/local/43499117.html",

        "content": "Well, Bill, Pastor Crackpot certainly didn't have to put much time into his sermon preparation! He is so unltra-Fundamentalist he can't stand other Christians. He is a prime example of why there will never be a Christian consensus. As far as the \"group\" therapy session, I think Oprah may be more successful? I've been in such meetings/churches and it is hard sometimes to tell just exactly is going on. I had them descend on me, too! Annoying! At first I thought the first young man may have a hangover and was puking on the floor (that I have seen!) and receiving a Pentecostal massage for good measure. But it happens a lot in the USA in thousands of little and big churches across the country. Why they video it all is odd. Freedom of religion = proliferation of weird cults.
