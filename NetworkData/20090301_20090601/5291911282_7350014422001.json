No where. I have no money to start my own life, and no disipline to keep me motivated. I went out on mimorial day weekend with a few of my girls, and a few guys they knew. One of them was a Ex Army Ranger, and at the age of 24 has done more then me in his life. And I find that really hard to do. He didn't talk much about he had done over seas but he did talk about how it was the most amazing thing he could of ever done. The other guy I didnt know was also in the army, I am unsure of his rank. He told me about some of his adventures. He even was stop lost, and he still said it was worth going into. I really want to join the army and see where my life of adventure could go from there. But I have a problem, no money or education. I was told by my recruiter, a long time ago when I was going to join to get of probation, that I must have at least a GED. Every GED class costs pretty close to 200 dollars a time taking the test.

Please if anyone can give me some good advice it will be greatly appreciated! Turning your life around can be done in the Military. I've seen kids do it. I've seen kids go off the deep end there, too. You've got to bring some self-discipline to the table - a quality you don't seem to have in any quantity. Get some. Set some goals and achieve them. The first would be GROW UP!! The second would be FINISH HIGH SCHOOL!! The third would be PROPERLY FINISH YOUR PROBATION!! Then go to your recruiter, if you've got the spine, and sign up for combat arms... Then stay with it through thick and thin and make something worthwhile of yourself, like the Young Men you met. Time for teenage childhood to end!! From what he's posted and his current bearing, I don't think he'd ever be ready for Military Service GW. Combat Arms? No way. I was a Draftee and ran across many Zero's in the 60's and 70's. This be one. IMO. Got money for everything but \"VETERANS\" Same old story!",

No where. I have no money to start my own life, and no disipline to keep me motivated. I went out on mimorial day weekend with a few of my girls, and a few guys they knew. One of them was a Ex Army Ranger, and at the age of 24 has done more then me in his life. And I find that really hard to do. He didn't talk much about he had done over seas but he did talk about how it was the most amazing thing he could of ever done. The other guy I didnt know was also in the army, I am unsure of his rank. He told me about some of his adventures. He even was stop lost, and he still said it was worth going into. I really want to join the army and see where my life of adventure could go from there. But I have a problem, no money or education. I was told by my recruiter, a long time ago when I was going to join to get of probation, that I must have at least a GED. Every GED class costs pretty close to 200 dollars a time taking the test. What Should I do? What can I do? What life should I chose? Please if anyone can give me some good advice it will be greatly appreciated! contact me at personal contact number are not authorized. Thank you. Hell, party 'til you drop. We'll remember you well.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by 18264929: I have a bit of a pickel. Torn between life styles of the compleat oppisite nature. On one hand I have no education what so ever. I got kicked out of high school my Sr. year with few credits to graduate. When I got kicked out of high school I got put on probation for 4 years. I did nothing but work full time to pay my probation and fines off. When I got off of the probation after the four years I moved to St. Croix U.S.V.I. Sence then I have been doing nothing but partying and living life moving all over America. Now I am stuck back in Michigan with no money to my name, but still living the lifestyle of a rockstar. Here it is really hard for me to get motivated and do anything because I can not find work, and I have no drivers license. For any normal person this would be a dead end wall, where you couldnt do anything because you have no money. But I have been such well connected her in MI the bars I get into free, drinks are bought for me by the bar tenders and the girls that beg me to come and hang out with them. I am surounded by beautiful women that want to party with me and pay for me all the time. Sounds like a dream come true I know. But on the other hand, I know where this path will get me in the end.
