They just ran the whole company into a place and we took tests for like two days. Because I enlisted, rather than being drafted, I had already taken a similar test. Some scores improved some didn't. Because everyone else was pretty much draftees, they probably didn't have much motivation to do well. I wanted to do as well as possible, because I had enlisted \"Armor\" and didn't want that to change. The deal about \"West Point\" was a bit of a shocker. I did have one year of college on an athletic scholarship, but it was anything but stellar, either academically or athletically. That's one of the reasons I decided to enlist. At that point, college wasn't for me. I was getting in too many fights and doing poorly in class. Army during Viet Nam seemed a more natural chose. But I'm still totally puzzled what all these strange acronyms and scores mean - - Wandering and Wondering",

Curiosity killed the wolf too You actually did quite well on your ASVAB. I did not have to retake the test in Basic... To this day I do not know why they retest you anyway. So for being the only kid in my Company NOT retaking the ASVAB... I got KP. LOL! You never win in the Army. My \"lowest\" individual score was 117. Highest was in the 140s. Most hovered about 130 or so. I do know that I was in the 97th percentile group. My mother STILL keeps commenting on that... after 34 years. LOL! Bought was right... I was an Airborne geek in Dress Greens... I was also offered West Point Prep. School (not Westpoint itself). And did not take it... Wonder if I should have taken the offer??? Ancient history now. They just ran the whole company into a place and we took tests for like two days. Because I enlisted, rather than being drafted, I had already taken a similar test. Some scores improved some didn't. Because everyone else was pretty much draftees, they probably didn't have much motivation to do well. I wanted to do as well as possible, because I had enlisted \"Armor\" and didn't want that to change. The deal about \"West Point\" was a bit of a shocker. I did have one year of college on an athletic scholarship, but it was anything but stellar, either academically or athletically. That's one of the reasons I decided to enlist. At that point, college wasn't for me. I was getting in too many fights and doing poorly in class. Army during Viet Nam seemed a more natural chose. But I'm still totally puzzled what all these strange acronyms and scores mean - -",
