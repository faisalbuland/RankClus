By Thomas Harding, Defence Correspondent Last Updated: 1:41PM GMT 26 Mar 2009 A force of 700 troops from 42 Commando along with Danish and Afghan troops swooped on the Taliban base of Marjah in a helicopter air assault that took three waves to offload the men. With Marjah a main base for processing opium and training forces, the enemy put up a fierce fight as the commandos swept through a network of mud brick compounds. Fighting was at very close quarters with troops using pistols, machine guns and in one instance a \u00a349,000 Javelin rocket to take out the enemy. They were also supported by Dutch F16 jets, British Apache attack helicopters and American Cobra helicopter gunships. Only two commandos were injured during Operation Blue Sword compared to an estimated 200 to 300 Taliban wounded. It is believed that the enemy dead included a Mullah regarded as a \u201chigh value target\u201d by the military. The Taliban were said to have been so determined to hold onto the stronghold that reinforcements were called for from the Pakistan border 160 miles away. (...) \u201cMarjah has long been a region that the insurgents claimed as their heartland, a place they felt secure and where they could gather, equip and train their forces,\u201d the MoD said in a statement. \u201cIt was also where they moved and stored weapons and explosives, and where the links between the insurgents and narcotics trade have been at their strongest.\u201d The Marines also discovered an arsenal of weapons and ten Improvised Explosive Devices which were disarmed. ++http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5054491/Taliban-lose-130-in-three-day-battle-with-Marines.html One good story deserves another, for those who may be interested: \"Royal Marine saves unit in spite of bullet to the head\" thread of military.com",
