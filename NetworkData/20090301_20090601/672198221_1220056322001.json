Citizens that are opposed to be seen by a sat must have something to hide (criminal activity?) How would you accomplish that? I would love to see how you would put an imaging satellites in orbit so they would have constant coverage of the entire US border. Also how many people would you have to have analyzing the images to actually find illegal immigrants or illegal activity. Also what would the point be since data is certain to be old by the time it has been taken and actually looked at to figure out what is in the pictures. I am sure it would be okay, since anybody that objects has to be a criminal. Nevermind the 4th Amendment it can't be that important, after all it is just the Constitution.",
