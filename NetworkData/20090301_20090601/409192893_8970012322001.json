This is the biggest governmental lie in the history of America. Hoover was a \"progressive\" (as today's socialists, also known as \"Democrats,\" have taken to calling themselves). ***Hoover strong-armed corporate executives into raising wages at a time when wages needed to adjust downward in the free market in order to minimize unemployment. He devoted 13% of the federal budget to a failed \"stimulus\" program of pork-barrel spending and imposed some of the biggest tax increases in history to fund it all. He was a protectionist who signed the notorious Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased the average tariff rate to nearly 60 percent and spawned a worldwide trade war that shrunk world trade by two-thirds in three years. He cartelized the agricultural industry with \"farm boards\" that began the insane practice of paying farmers for not growing crops or raising livestock.

And it is just one of numerous financial regulatory agencies (the SEC, Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, FDIC, and numerous state regulators also exist). In a Fed publication entitled \"The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions,\" it is explained that \"The Federal Reserve has supervisory and regulatory authority over a wide range of financial institutions and activities.\" That's the understatement of the century. Among the Fed's functions are the regulation of: Bank holding companies State-chartered banks Foreign branches of member banks Edge and agreement corporations US state-licensed branches, agencies, and representative offices of foreign banks Nonbanking activities of foreign banks National banks (with the Comptroller of the Currency) Savings banks (with the Office of Thrift Supervision) Nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies Thrift holding companies Financial reporting Accounting policies of banks Business \"continuity\" in case of an economic emergency Consumer-protection laws Securities dealings of banks Information technology used by banks Foreign investments of banks Foreign lending by banks Branch banking Bank mergers and acquisitions Who may own a bank Capital \"adequacy standards\" Extensions of credit for the purchase of securities Equal-opportunity lending Mortgage disclosure information Reserve requirements Electronic-funds transfers Interbank liabilities Community Reinvestment Act subprime lending requirements All international banking operations Consumer leasing Privacy of consumer financial information Payments on demand deposits \"Fair credit\" reporting Transactions between member banks and their affiliates Truth in lending Truth in savings That's a pretty comprehensive list, the result of 96 years of bureaucratic empire building by Fed bureaucrats. It gives the lie to the notion that there has been \"too little regulation\" of financial markets.

Most of them made their money by providing valuable \u2014 if not revolutionary \u2014 goods and services to the masses at lower and lower prices for decades at a time. John D. Rockefeller, for example, caused the price of refined petroleum to drop from 30 cents per gallon in 1869 to 8 cents in 1885, and continued to drop his prices for many years thereafter. James J. Hill built the most efficient and profitable transcontinental railroad without a dime's worth of government subsidy. In return for their remarkable free-market success the government prosecuted both of these men, kangaroo court style, under the protectionist \"antitrust\" laws. The real \"robbers\" were politically connected businessmen like Leland Stanford, a former California governor and senator, who succeeded in getting laws passed that granted his company a monopoly in the California railroad business ***Higher worker productivity, fueled mostly by capital investment by entrepreneurs and private investors, also made it less necessary for families to force their children to work. Child labor was on the wane for decades before government got around to regulating or outlawing it. And when it did so it was to protect unionized labor from competition, not to protect children from harsh working conditions. The purpose of government is for those who run it to plunder those who do not. Throughout history, governments have used violence, intimidation, coercion, and mass murder to enforce this system. But governments' first line of \"defense\" is always a blizzard of lies \u2014 about its own alleged benevolence, altruism, heroism, and greatness, along with equally big lies about the \"evils\" of the civil society, especially the free market.",
