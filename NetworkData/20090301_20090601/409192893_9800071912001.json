To support that: From unionleader.com Speaking of his $3.6 trillion budget, President Obama asserted on Tuesday, \"This budget is inseparable from this recovery. It is what lays the foundation for a secure and lasting prosperity.\" The first sentence is an impossibility. The second is a non sequitur. First, the President would have us believe that only his budget can pull the economy out of recession. If it is not passed, there can be no recovery. That is the meaning of \"inseparable.\" Does anyone on earth, even the President, actually believe that? The President then claims that his budget creates immediate economic recovery by expanding government control over some sectors of the economy -- namely health care, education and energy -- in the future. Yet his own budget projections show full economic recovery by the end of this year -- long before his planned cap-and-trade regime, health care overhaul and increased education subsidies take effect. We don't need Republicans to point out that the President is being dishonest. His own budget does the job. According to the President, the American people have only two options: the colossal expansion of Washington power he proposes or economic stagnation.",
