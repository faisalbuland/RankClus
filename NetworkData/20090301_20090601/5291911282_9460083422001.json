Now that I'm going to Panama regularly, I'd like to get re-certified and check out what Panama and other places have to offer. The biggest difference is that in the NAUI Openwater I course, a student is taught basic dive rescue(bringing a diver simulating unconciousness to the surface, and initiate rescue breathing) while in the PADI system of diver training that particular exercise is not taught until the Rescue Diver Course....NAUI courses also have a bigger emphasis on snorkeling skills at the surface....Also; during the NAUI divemaster course, a Divemaster candidate is required to do an 880 yd. snorkel with mask, fins, bcd(no tank) and weightbelt in 18 min...The PADI DM course requires an DM candidate to snorkel 800 yds in mask, snorkel, and fins, NO TIME LIMIT..... If you were NAUI certified, it is not necessary to re-certify....You certification should be on file and your card easily replaced just contact NAUI HQ (they are located in Tampa, I believe)...I would highly recommend a refresher course...They are taught at pretty much any dive shop..Regardless of Certification Agency....Hope that helps brah, now dust off the gear AND GO GET WET!!!!!

I had active Open Water, Wreck and Cave Diving certs...I let them lapse from living in the dry Arizona desert these last couple of decades and never diving once during that time. Now that I'm going to Panama regularly, I'd like to get re-certified and check out what Panama and other places have to offer.", 
        "reply": " The biggest difference is that in the NAUI Openwater I course, a student is taught basic dive rescue(bringing a diver simulating unconciousness to the surface, and initiate rescue breathing) while in the PADI system of diver training that particular exercise is not taught until the Rescue Diver Course....NAUI courses also have a bigger emphasis on snorkeling skills at the surface....Also; during the NAUI divemaster course, a Divemaster candidate is required to do an 880 yd. snorkel with mask, fins, bcd(no tank) and weightbelt in 18 min...The PADI DM course requires an DM candidate to snorkel 800 yds in mask, snorkel, and fins, NO TIME LIMIT..... If you were NAUI certified, it is not necessary to re-certify....You certification should be on file and your card easily replaced just contact NAUI HQ (they are located in Tampa, I believe)...I would highly recommend a refresher course...They are taught at pretty much any dive shop..Regardless of Certification Agency....Hope that helps brah, now dust off the gear AND GO GET WET!!!!! There is another distinction..(some dive instructor humor for you) NAUI= Not Another Underwater Idiot PADI= Pay And Dive Immediately Duane A.

The moray eels living below the kelp beds off the point at about 60 feet didn't mind the cold water at all. They were looking for food in the diver's game bags---abalones, etc.",

If you were NAUI certified, it is not necessary to re-certify....You certification should be on file and your card easily replaced just contact NAUI HQ (they are located in Tampa, I believe)...I would highly recommend a refresher course...They are taught at pretty much any dive shop..Regardless of Certification Agency....Hope that helps brah, now dust off the gear AND GO GET WET!!!!!
