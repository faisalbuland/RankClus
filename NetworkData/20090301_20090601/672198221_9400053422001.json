So where do we go from here or what do we do to the Koreans? do we bomb them back to the stone age? or do we impose economical sanctions on them like in Cuba?.have you seen the life of the north koreans locals?....look, none of these things are going to work in these political climates, nor do we have the (WILL POWER) to start another war, America nor the rest of the world for that matter want to go to war against anybody, the north koreans made their move when they knew the world was (NOT) in the mood for more war of any calible. Now, we are waiting for the north koreans to act responsible with this new power they have unleased....JUST REMEMBER, BECAREFULL OF WHAT YOU ASK FOR...BECAUSE YOU JUST MAY GET IT.....and now that you have it...you're playing with the big boys, Good Luck!!!",
