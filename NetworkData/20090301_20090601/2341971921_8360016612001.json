Yet, when Barack Obama in his inaugural address reached out to Muslims by saying \"to the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect,\" his formulation was needlessly defensive and apologetic. Is it \"new\" to acknowledge Muslim interests and show respect to the Muslim world? Obama doesn't just think so, he said so again to millions in his al-Arabiya interview, insisting on the need to \"restore\" the \"same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago.\" Astonishing. In these most recent 20 years -- the alleged winter of our disrespect of the Islamic world -- America did not just respect Muslims, it bled for them. It engaged in five military campaigns, every one of which involved -- and resulted in -- the liberation of a Muslim people: Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq. The two Balkan interventions -- as well as the failed 1992-93 Somalia intervention to feed starving African Muslims (43 Americans were killed) -- were humanitarian exercises of the highest order, there being no significant U.S. strategic interest at stake. In these 20 years, this nation has done more for suffering and oppressed Muslims than any nation, Muslim or non-Muslim, anywhere on Earth. Why are we apologizing? And what of that happy U.S.-Muslim relationship that Obama imagines existed \"as recently as 20 or 30 years ago\" that he has now come to restore? Thirty years ago, 1979, saw the greatest U.S.-Muslim rupture in our 233-year history: Iran's radical Islamic revolution, the seizure of the U.S. Embassy, the 14 months of America held hostage. Which came just a few years after the Arab oil embargo that sent the United States into a long and punishing recession. Which, in turn, was preceded by the kidnapping and cold-blooded execution by Arab terrorists of the U.S. ambassador in Sudan and his charg\u00e9 d'affaires. This is to say nothing of the Marine barracks massacre of 1983, and the innumerable attacks on U.S. embassies and installations around the world during what Obama now characterizes as the halcyon days of U.S.-Islamic relations. Look. If Barack Obama wants to say, as he said to al-Arabiya, I have Muslim roots, Muslim family members, have lived in a Muslim country -- implying a special affinity that uniquely positions him to establish good relations -- that's fine. But it is both false and deeply injurious to this country to draw a historical line dividing America under Obama from a benighted past when Islam was supposedly disrespected and demonized. As in Obama's grand admonition: \"We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.\" Have \"we\" been doing that, smearing Islam because of a small minority? George W. Bush went to the Islamic Center in Washington six days after the Sept. 11 attacks, when the fires of Ground Zero were still smoldering, to declare \"Islam is peace,\" to extend fellowship and friendship to Muslims, to insist that Americans treat them with respect and generosity of spirit. And America listened. In these seven years since Sept. 11 -- seven years during which thousands of Muslims rioted all over the world (resulting in the death of more than 100) to avenge a bunch of cartoons -- there's not been a single anti-Muslim riot in the United States to avenge the massacre of 3,000 innocents. On the contrary. In its aftermath, we elected our first Muslim member of Congress and our first president of Muslim parentage. \"My job,\" says Obama, \"is to communicate to the American people that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live better lives.\" That's his job? Do the American people think otherwise? Does he think he is bravely breaking new ground? George Bush, Condoleezza Rice and countless other leaders offered myriad expressions of that same universalist sentiment. Every president has the right to portray himself as ushering in a new era of this or that. Obama wants to pursue new ties with Muslim nations, drawing on his own identity and associations. Good. But when his self-inflation as redeemer of U.S.-Muslim relations leads him to suggest that pre-Obama America was disrespectful or insensitive or uncaring of Muslims, he is engaging not just in fiction but in gratuitous disparagement of the country he is now privileged to lead. Iran has already responded to the Obama overture. In perfect tune with Obama's defensiveness, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared that better relations might be possible -- after America apologized for 60 years of crimes against Iran. Note the 60 years. The mullahs are as mystified by Obama's pre-1979 (or 1989) good old days as I am.",

Sad to say, our hands aren't that clean, and sixty odd years ago, we were right in the thick of things regarding oil-based imperialism. To understand just how ****ed off the Iranians are, you need to review the results of the following actions by the CIA and State Department: We also supported Iraq during the deadly Iran-Iraq war. Iran suffered half a million killed, 1 million casualties in a country of 63 million. In other words one in three men of military age during the conflict were either killed or wounded. Those types of casualties won't be forgotten for a couple of generations. When you add it all up, you have one heck of a reason for their government to dislike, distrust and discredit anything the US does or takes interest in, including our steadfast support of Israel (whom they don't even recognize as a country). I'm not saying they are these events and references are completely accurate. Whether they are or not is really immaterial. The important thing to remember it that their government plays up these events in their propaganda, media and schools. The Iranian public opinion of the US intentions and motivations are consequently somewhat jaded, no matter what our current president says or does. In short, we are and have been considered the enemy of this regime. In many ways, we've earned that title, for good or ill. Overcoming that will take a great deal more that handshakes and promises of peace initiatives. Thrust - the battles of Tours and Lepanto should never be confused as 'the march of Islam.' Neither should they be lumped together in any discussion of relative history. They are completely unrelated. The first, despite the claims of the Franks, was little more than a raid accross the Pyranees. It never was an attempt at conquest. Lepanto was engineered by an entirely different culture, that of the Ottoman Turks. That they were a Muslim country was incidental to both their political and military goals and endeavors. Besides, the real 'defeat' occured some six years before the naval battle, when the Knights of Malta resisted a siege by the Sultan (1565). Once the Holy League was formed based upon that victory, the battle of Lepanto and the subsequent decline of the Ottoman Navy was virtually a foregone conclusion. One of the curiosities of that battle was once it was fought, BOTH sides lost the Mediterranean. The Ottomans never threatened in the same manner even though they rebuilt their navy (too many specialists lost), Venice was all but bankrupt and never again was able to field a navy of any size, Spain was destined to throw their full focus north to the Neatherlands in an unwinnable war and compound their folly with a disasterous naval campaign (The Armada of 1588), and the Papal States begain a slow decline, being trapped both politically and economically int he growing conflict between Spain and France. In short, there were no 'victors' from Lepanto. Absolutely none of the participants were able to recover from the losses or to garner any appreciable advantage from the victory. About all that could be said is that coastal raiding of Christian lands changed from an organized state occupation of the Ottomans to a disorganized commercial occupation of the pirates of the Babary States (which incidentally continued for another two hundred years until the Napoleanic Wars put a stop to it).

That is the same argument that Islamic scholars use but I disagree with it entirely. They were on the march in force in Western Europe in the same manner as they had been elsewhere in the world. That they were defeated in decisive battle and retreated across the Pyrenees should illustrate the importance and realism of decisive battle against an overextended force. It proved true enough for the Islamic armies themselves at Yarmuk. Also important to understanding why the battle of France is so important is because Islamic law dictates that they have permanent dominion over anything that they have ever conquered.

        "content": "You use the word \"They\" to denote two very different cultures separated by nearly 700 years and joined by only the most tenuous link of a common religion (which, after 700 years was a very different animal indeed). It just doesn't work that way. The 8th century Moors and Berber tribesmen of North Africa had an entirely different and distinctive culture from that of the 14th-15th Century Turkish tribes of Central Asia and Anatolia. They neither coordinated nor joined in any manner, other than a very loose collaboration much later in their existence. Even then the link was less substantial than the Ottoman Empire had with ostensibly Christian nations; that of France and Venice for instance. It is an ironic point of fact that the diplomatic and military alliance between the Ottomans and pre-Bourbon France was a far more substantial and real threat to the other \"Christian\" nations of the Mediterranean than that of the Barbary States. Besides, if they were indeed linked as you imply you would think that the Morisco insurrection that the Spanish fought just prior to Lepanto would have been sponsored or even acknowledged by the Ottomans. It wasn't. The Ottomans neither cared nor bothered with any support of their co-religionists in Spain. Ironically, this was stated by the man who ought to know best: Don Juan of Austria, who led both the Hapsburg fight against the Moriscos and was the Holy League's commander at Lepanto. I never said Lepanto wasn't decisive, only that the conditions for success for the Ottomans were incredibly steep. By rights, Ali Pasha should have never fought the encounter, as a tactical withdrawal would have been much better than the strategic defeat they suffered. I seriously doubt if Piale Pasha (his more experienced predecessor) would have made the same mistake. My only point was that for such a overwhelming victory by the Holy League, the spoils weren't all that much. As 'decisive' and dramatic as it seemed at the time, it was in fact only a very marginal victory for each member of the alliance. As the league dissolved almost as soon as the victory was achieved, the result must be viewed in that light. Actually, the first time the Ottomans under Suleiman were decisively 'beaten' was in 1565 at the Siege of Malta. Had the knight's fortresses fallen, it would have meant the Holy League would have lost before it was even formed. As it was, the loss of the cream of the Janissary Corps meant that the next six years were relatively free from any sailing of the Ottoman fleet, even though the fleet itself was still operational. It was after all an amphibious force rather than an exclusively naval fleet. REFERENCE: This amphibious nature of Galley warfare is best described by John Guilmartins' excellent book \"Gunpowder and Galleys\" (I suggest an inter-library loan - the cheapest version I've found was around $90 used on Amazon). Incidentally, the Ottoman's biggest 'setback' in the West might have been the Pyrrhic victory at Mohacs in 1526. What had started as political pressure to exclude Hapsburg influence in the Hungarian succession ended in the unwanted death of the young king (who drowned in the retreat), thereby ensuring the worst case scenario for the Ottomans - a continuous war with the Hapsburg Empire rather than a submissive border state of a cowed but ostensibly independent Hungary. For all their threats and attempts at Vienna, the city was just too far operationally for a pre-Napoleonic army, however well organized the Janissary Corps was at the time. The round trip march time from Adrianople to Vienna meant an inadequate time for reduction of the Viennese fortifications by available siege guns of the time before the onset of fall/winter closed the passes through the Balkans. Surprise was impossible (largely due to the excellent spy network of the Knights of St. John), and an Army of the size needed to take the city was impossible to supply in the field throughout the winter. All in all, the Ottoman threat to Vienna was real, but the war itself was an unwise endeavor that was UNWANTED by the Sultan Suleiman at the time. Taking Vienna was virtually impossible for the Ottomans to accomplish in all but the most favorable conditions. Neither the siege of 1529 (begun too late in the season) nor that of 1683 (begun a year late giving the Viennese 15 months to coordinate a relieving force) were conducted under anything close to favorable conditions. Want to know the real reason behind the decline of the Ottomans? Incredibly, it was due to the singular influence of an obscure Circassian slave girl named 'the laughing one' by her captors. She ended life as the most influential woman of the time, both in real power at the time and the lasting influence as her son's Regent. Without her, the Ottomans were all but unstoppable. After her rise, they never really threatened again. Her actions over the succession of her son is the source of the internal conflict that culminated in the Ottoman Empire becoming the 'Sick Man of Europe' so soon after being the 'Scourge of God'. Look up the name 'Roxelanna.' Fascinating story. Her rise to power may be commemorated by a significant change in the rules for the game of chess. The original Persian game had a queen, but it was just as weak and immobile as the King. After her death, the modern game of chess with the nearly all-powerful queen became popular in Europe.

Had the knight's fortresses fallen, it would have meant the Holy League would have lost before it was even formed. As it was, the loss of the cream of the Janissary Corps meant that the next six years were relatively free from any sailing of the Ottoman fleet, even though the fleet itself was still operational. It was after all an amphibious force rather than an exclusively naval fleet. REFERENCE: This amphibious nature of Galley warfare is best described by John Guilmartins' excellent book \"Gunpowder and Galleys\" (I suggest an inter-library loan - the cheapest version I've found was around $90 used on Amazon). Incidentally, the Ottoman's biggest 'setback' in the West might have been the Pyrrhic victory at Mohacs in 1526. What had started as political pressure to exclude Hapsburg influence in the Hungarian succession ended in the unwanted death of the young king (who drowned in the retreat), thereby ensuring the worst case scenario for the Ottomans - a continuous war with the Hapsburg Empire rather than a submissive border state of a cowed but ostensibly independent Hungary. For all their threats and attempts at Vienna, the city was just too far operationally for a pre-Napoleonic army, however well organized the Janissary Corps was at the time. The round trip march time from Adrianople to Vienna meant an inadequate time for reduction of the Viennese fortifications by available siege guns of the time before the onset of fall/winter closed the passes through the Balkans. Surprise was impossible (largely due to the excellent spy network of the Knights of St. John), and an Army of the size needed to take the city was impossible to supply in the field throughout the winter. All in all, the Ottoman threat to Vienna was real, but the war itself was an unwise endeavor that was UNWANTED by the Sultan Suleiman at the time. Taking Vienna was virtually impossible for the Ottomans to accomplish in all but the most favorable conditions. Neither the siege of 1529 (begun too late in the season) nor that of 1683 (begun a year late giving the Viennese 15 months to coordinate a relieving force) were conducted under anything close to favorable conditions. Want to know the real reason behind the decline of the Ottomans? Incredibly, it was due to the singular influence of an obscure Circassian slave girl named 'the laughing one' by her captors. She ended life as the most influential woman of the time, both in real power at the time and the lasting influence as her son's Regent. Without her, the Ottomans were all but unstoppable. After her rise, they never really threatened again. Her actions over the succession of her son is the source of the internal conflict that culminated in the Ottoman Empire becoming the 'Sick Man of Europe' so soon after being the 'Scourge of God'. Look up the name 'Roxelanna.' Fascinating story. Her rise to power may be commemorated by a significant change in the rules for the game of chess. The original Persian game had a queen, but it was just as weak and immobile as the King. After her death, the modern game of chess with the nearly all-powerful queen became popular in Europe.

        "content": "France?!! You must be joking. The Ottomans had no better ally than pre-Bourbon, Bourbon and Revolutionary France. That's nearly 300 years of staunch support against the likes of Genoa, Venice, and especially Spain (actually Aragon, but including Castille after the 1490s). Hell, Josephine's (Nappy's first wife) best friend from childhood became the mother of the Sultan! They were friends at a convent in Martinique enroute to France when it was waylaid by pirates. Josephine's family was wealthy enough to ransom her, but not her cousin who eventually was purchased in Constantinople for the Sultan's seraglio. She eventually became a favorite and was known as the Sultana Valida. They regularly traded correspondence and had amazing influence on their husbands. If you want a champion of Christianity against Islam, look no further than Aragon and Castille. The reconquista took nearly 600 years. Even afterwards, Spain waged war against the Moors, the Berbers and the Turks. The greatest contingent of vessels at Lepanto flew the Spanish flag (there was not a single French ship, I might add). From the begining of the Moorish conquest, through the Crusades, the Renaissance and up to the Thirty Year's War (1618-1638), Spain's greatest military deployments were against the followers of Islam. However, that being said, to equate all co-religionists is to miss the most significant motivations and reasons for conflict. For instance, do you equate Irish Catholics with Spanish, French and Italian Catholics? How about Protestants? Are they all the same too? Is a German Lutheran prince from say 1628 motivated by the same influences that a Lutheran King from Sweden, even if they fight on the same side in a war? It's utter nonsense to pretend that is so, as both have significant cultural differences and economic interests. Failing to understand those differences leads one down a difficult path when reading history, as events like the Thirty Years War fail to make any sense. It wasn't just a matter of faith, and neither were the 'battles against Islam' throughout history. If you fail to address all factors, you will badly misinterpret the significance of events and thereby lose whatever understanding that can be gained by a thorough investigation of the subject matter.

His line came from the house of Anjou, he spoke the language, practiced the customs, worshipped the same, and spent most of his life in France. That he was the King of England only shows how dominant France was. quote: They never gave a rat about us and our cause. Neither did Napoleon, the Bourbon kings who followed him, Napoleon III nor any other French government up to and including the present day. I disagree. Napoleon III was nothing if not a man of ideals. He may have failed in the long run, but his actions were those of a statesman who wanted to take part in the affairs of the world and to support the rights of man. His interest in building the Suez canal were not merely to empower France, as they would obviously make Britain that much stronger. He put his hand out like a gentleman only to be treated with condescention time and time again. He actually wrote a book called \"The end of Pauperism\" where he explained how he planned to improve the lot of the common people. We now know that this is hardly ever effective, but it illustrates what kind of man he was. That was far more than his hypocritical critics, such as Victor Hugo, ever did. Certainly Napoleon III had more vision than the fat, lazy Karl Marx ever did.....even though Napoleon had a country to run and Marx was too busy getting sloshed, write ****ty atheist philosophy, and letting his kids at home starve to death. Napoleon III sent us more aid in our struggle against tyranny than any other country, and would have lent us the full might of his army and navy had the British not curtailed him. The Third Republic was right to side with the Czar if only because the new German Empire was twice as strong as France and very willing to use its strength to emphasize the point. I don't know where Nicholas II should carry on in sharing the onus of his predecessors. He was merely ineffectual. It doesn't belie the fact that France had given aid to all who resisted Russia before the end of the Second Empire. I would also add that the Third Republic should indeed be distinguished from all others. It was a radical creature - one which spied on its own officers and recorded how many times they attended Mass. Even Petain was called up on this when he was a young officer. I fear it is the same direction our country is going in now..... quote: Thrust, i must agree with Sullivan. Richelieu aid to protestants was Realpolitik. He as a matter of fact started the \"raison d'etat\"=\"state reasoning\". I have yet to see an article that uses \"ideological reasoning\" rather than the Realpolitik explanation. As far as i know all historians view Cardinal's decision through Realpolitik lenses and not ideological ones. I think it is most obviously as you say. However, Richelieu was a product of his culture, and that was one that know when to lay ideology aside FOR the sake of politics. Had it not been for the terrible French Civil War in the 16th century, the nature of the country may not have been the same. As it happened, France was the first country to move towards what we now call \"freedom of religion,\" because the pain that the country had gone through. That actually should go back to the Cathar Inquisition and even Joan of Arc, since they were the morning star of the reformation. quote: So, you don't have to look too far into the past to find very valid reasons for the people of the Middle East to hate us. You may see TODAY that we are supporting our \"allys\" who are murdering and starving and robbing these people, and only lightly \"expressing concern\". I think that we have been largely blinded by events relating to our relations with the Islamic world and have been unable to distinguish between our true foes and those who are not. I will say that I can't respect Arafat any more than I do any demagogue that rides on a wave of populism. At the same time, how much more terrible he seemed to be in league with the side that blew up our Marine Barracks in 1983. In those circumstances (and coming on the heel of the Iranian Revolution), it was easy to write him off and excuse what Israel (and its allies) had done in Lebanon. So Israel started to get a pass from us in the 1980's. We had been moving towards them since the 1967 war, but it really took off in the 80's. It was in the 80's that the Republican party started to change in character, and by the time of HW Bush, it was the creature that has led us poorly over these past several years. I think that the further we get away from our own roots, the more confused we will be in our foreign policy. The unilateral support for Israel (in its aggressive stature, not its mere existence) is a symptom of America's ills.",

Their nobles may have spoken the language, but their neither the French crown nor the Normans themselves up to and including Richard Coeur-de-Lion thought of themselves as 'French' for several centuries. It wasn't really until the end of the Hundred Year's War (1453) that the province of Normandy was considered part of France by any stretch of the imagination.",
