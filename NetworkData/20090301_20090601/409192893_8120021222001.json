The fact is Obama's budgets increase outlays by $1 trillion over the 600 billion Bush had already increased. Beyond that if you play Obama's numbers out to 2012, which I'll grant you is a lot like wishing on a star, he has proposed my spending over that timke frame then the entire history of this country.

I would guess that you whined while Reagan, Bush I and Bush II put on the $10 plus trillion? Or are you new to this? Keep making excuses for your incompetent mesiah. You do realize you just compared money spent by 3 previous presidents and all of their combined time in office as opposed to BO and the mere hundred days he has been the president? It is just so comical to watch you good folks whine about the debt. Especially when the largest socialist program added in decades was the republican sponsered Medicare Part D which along with Medicare together will add a trillion dollars a year in the coming years.
