        "content": "The time for partisan bickering just ended. This is as serious as a heart attack. Obama is going to spend so much money, which he intends to get from China via the sale of government backed bonds, that the Chinese apparently don't think he'll be able to make good on them. So President Obama gave the Chinese eminent domain rights to American land and businesses as collateral -- i.e., if we don't pay, they now own America. The written agreement was brought to Beijing by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and was formalized and agreed-to during her recent trip to China. This means that in the event the US Government defaults on its financial obligations to China, the Communist Government of China would be permitted to physically take -- inside the USA -- land, buildings, factories, perhaps even entire cities -- to satisfy the financial obligations of the US government. Put simply, Obama has now actually mortgaged the physical land and property of all citizens and businesses in the United States. He has given to a foreign power, their Constitutional power to \"take\" all of our property, as actual collateral for continued Chinese funding of US deficit spending and the continued carrying of US national debt. This is an unimaginable betrayal of every man, woman and child in the USA. Here is one of the bond agreements! Google any town or city/county with Cede & Co.! It is the basic agreement they all use. ~ Thanks Calpernia ~ George Soros and Quantum Partners. Cede & Co. is under: - SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC. in Delaware - Quantum Industrial Partners LDC in Cayman Islands - QIH Management Investor, L.P. in Delaware - QIH Management, Inc. in Delaware - Stanley F. Druckenmiller - Duquesne Capital Management, L.L.C. in Pennsylvania Update: I'm getting a lot of questions about this story. So what's available is this report and this report -- they're usually pretty reliable -- in the meantime, no major outlet has yet released or referenced this report. I don't know if I'd take this to the bank just yet. There's 194 references to \"Obama Grants Eminent Domain Rights to China\" on the Internet at 1800 Eastern. Red County has a report that points to the Examiner as the source. The Examiner names the Patriot Room and LiveLeak as its sources. LiveLeak deadends. The LiveLeak report has no source. Patriot Room attributes the report to the Hal Turner Show -- \"Honest talk in a time of universal deceit.\" The Hal Turner Show Blog, in a February 26, 2009 entry, entitled, \"FEDS GRANT EMINENT DOMAIN AS COLLATERAL TO CHINA FOR U.S. DEBTS!,\" contains this statement in the second paragraph: \"On February 11, Bloomberg Business News reported that China was seeking \"guarantees\" for its US Government debt (Story Here), and it now appears they got it. Well placed senior sources at the US Embassy in Beijing CONFIRM the formal written agreement was delivered by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her recent trip to China.\" The third paragraph draws a conclusion: \"This means that in the event the US Government defaults on its financial obligations to China, the Communist Government of China would be permitted to physically take -- inside the USA -- land, buildings, factories, perhaps even entire cities - to satisfy the financial obligations of the US government.\" It appears Turner draws his conclusion from this statement in the Bloomberg report: He Zhicheng, an economist at Agricultural Bank of China, the nation\u2019s third-largest lender by assets, \"In talks with Clinton, China will ask for a guarantee that the U.S. will support the dollar\u2019s exchange rate and make sure China\u2019s dollar-denominated assets are safe,\" said He in Beijing. \"That would be one of the prerequisites for more purchases.\" Bloomberg Business News report that China was seeking \"guarantees\" for its US Government debt -- probably true. As Bloomberg reports: \"China\u2019s loss of more than $5 billion from investing $10.5 billion of its reserves in New York-based Blackstone Group LP, Morgan Stanley and TPG Inc. since mid-2007 may increase its demand for the relative safety of Treasuries.\" said Zhang Ming, secretary general of the international finance research center at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. \"The government will be a net buyer of Treasuries in the short term because there\u2019s no sign they have changed their strategy.\" So, in the negotiations, China made it clear they were shaky about the deal and they wanted guarantees. Those guarantees would come in the form of Treasuries -- bonds. So, China will hold a lot of American bonds. Hillary Clinton dutifully went on Chinese television and urged China to keep buying U.S. treasury bonds. \"It's a good investment, it's a safe investment,\" she gushed. \"Our economies are so intertwined. The Chinese know that in order to start exporting again to its biggest market, the United States has to take some drastic measures with the stimulus package. We have to incur more debt. The Chinese recognize our interconnection\" So, the question becomes -- what is in the agreement? And, buried way, way down in the US - China agreement is there boilerplate that contains a standard bond agreement with language that would give China, or whomever/whatever, access to the eminent domain process?
