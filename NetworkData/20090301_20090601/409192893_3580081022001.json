Bush held the Saudi monarch's hand and kissed his cheek. But hand holding by men is a common gesture of friendship, not subservience, in Arab culture, as is kissing of the cheek. And yes, Dick Cheney was awarded a medal by the Saudi monarch, and lowered his head so that medal could be draped from his neck on a ribbon. And receiving an honor is not the same as an immediate unreciprocated bow upon meeting a monarch for the first time. There is no question that an unreciprocated bow is a gesture of subservience. Bowing is a very serious matter in many cultures. I have counseled hundreds of Western executives on the intricacies of bowing when dealing with Japanese business executives, stressing that an unreciprocated bow is a rude gesture of dominance. The body language is clear and unmistakable in all cultures. Abe Greenwald of Commentary understands the symbolism: Among Muslim democrats and human rights advocates, utter dejection that the \"leader of the Free World\" has offered himself as a \"subject\" of the Saudi monarch; among Islamists, bliss over America's seeming prostration before Salafist Islam; among international bad actors, assurance that America poses no threat; and among our allies, depression about the new systemic instability of the most dependable superpower in history. The old saying that one picture is worth a thousand words is actually amplified when it comes to cross-cultural communication. I have little doubt that the Muslim world's media will not be as circumspect as their American mainstream colleagues in displaying the demi-prostration of the American leader carrying the name Hussein to the guardian of Islam's holiest cities. Until evidence is produced that Barack Obama habitually bows and bends his knew before others, I will have to assume that he meant this gesture to carry meaning. It is simply amazing to me that our media will not even present this image to the American public. If you don't agree with that, IMO, you are not a patriotic American. These are my opinions. Yours may differ.",

I have counseled hundreds of Western executives on the intricacies of bowing when dealing with Japanese business executives, stressing that an unreciprocated bow is a rude gesture of dominance. The body language is clear and unmistakable in all cultures. Abe Greenwald of Commentary understands the symbolism: Among Muslim democrats and human rights advocates, utter dejection that the \"leader of the Free World\" has offered himself as a \"subject\" of the Saudi monarch; among Islamists, bliss over America's seeming prostration before Salafist Islam; among international bad actors, assurance that America poses no threat; and among our allies, depression about the new systemic instability of the most dependable superpower in history. The old saying that one picture is worth a thousand words is actually amplified when it comes to cross-cultural communication. I have little doubt that the Muslim world's media will not be as circumspect as their American mainstream colleagues in displaying the demi-prostration of the American leader carrying the name Hussein to the guardian of Islam's holiest cities. Until evidence is produced that Barack Obama habitually bows and bends his knew before others, I will have to assume that he meant this gesture to carry meaning. It is simply amazing to me that our media will not even present this image to the American public. If you don't agree with that, IMO, you are not a patriotic American. These are my opinions. Yours may differ.",
