The Nam was a different kind of war. I guess you had to be there to fully understand. If you weren't then trying to explain is useless. We never asked for a special day, we just wanted the recognition due us for our efforts. We are finally starting to get it riding on the backs of today's warriors. Are we special? No!, just different. Ever been spit on lady?",

Never, EVER depend upon someone else to provide evidence of your claim. Send it yourself. Even if that someone else does send it, and you do to, it's better for the adjudicator to have two copies than none. And, that includes the VA. Even though his health records are computerized and they're supposed to be provided, don't assume they will be. That adjudicator has no obligation to find evidence for your claim, so go down to records release at your local VA and get copies and send them in.
