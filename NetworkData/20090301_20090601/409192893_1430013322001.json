There is no \"notion\" because she never said she knew nothing. Why don't you read what she said instead of parroting what has been said to get the eyes off what is really important. More sleight of hand. \"We were not, I repeat, we were not told that waterboarding or any of these other interrogation methods were used. What they did tell us was they had some legislative counsel opinions ... And if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\" Nancy Pelosi SOURCE: Real Clear Politics 3 weeks ago Did you not watch her speech this morning where she denied it yet again only this time reacted in the typical democratic way of blaming others. quote: Excerpt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused CIA officials Thursday of misleading her in 2002 about the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning and has been described by critics as torture. Pelosi reiterated an earlier claim that she was briefed on such techniques only once -- in September 2002 -- and that she was told at the time that the techniques were not being used. A former senior intelligence official said Thursday it is \"inconceivable\" that the CIA briefers would not have talked about interrogation methods that had already been used. \"I can't prove it,\" the official said, but added, \"The whole point [of the briefings] was to make sure they [lawmakers] understood what we were doing.\" The official asked to comment anonymously so he could speak more candidly. The official said it is important to put this all into the context of the time -- less than a year after the 9/11 attacks.

And if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\" Nancy Pelosi SOURCE: Real Clear Politics 3 weeks ago Did you not watch her speech this morning where she denied it yet again only this time reacted in the typical democratic way of blaming others. quote: Excerpt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused CIA officials Thursday of misleading her in 2002 about the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning and has been described by critics as torture. Pelosi reiterated an earlier claim that she was briefed on such techniques only once -- in September 2002 -- and that she was told at the time that the techniques were not being used. A former senior intelligence official said Thursday it is \"inconceivable\" that the CIA briefers would not have talked about interrogation methods that had already been used. \"I can't prove it,\" the official said, but added, \"The whole point [of the briefings] was to make sure they [lawmakers] understood what we were doing.\" The official asked to comment anonymously so he could speak more candidly.

Pelosi reiterated an earlier claim that she was briefed on such techniques only once -- in September 2002 -- and that she was told at the time that the techniques were not being used. A former senior intelligence official said Thursday it is \"inconceivable\" that the CIA briefers would not have talked about interrogation methods that had already been used. \"I can't prove it,\" the official said, but added, \"The whole point [of the briefings] was to make sure they [lawmakers] understood what we were doing.\" The official asked to comment anonymously so he could speak more candidly. The official said it is important to put this all into the context of the time -- less than a year after the 9/11 attacks. Back then, everyone was in the same boat trying to figure out what to do,\" the official said. \"The executive branch, the Hill, DOJ [Department of Justice], the White House were trying to figure out what to do so this would not happen again.\" Pelosi said the briefing she received from the CIA was incomplete and inaccurate, and she called on the CIA to release a full transcript of it.
