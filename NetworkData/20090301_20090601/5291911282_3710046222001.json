I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d read the captions \u2013 hey, I\u2019m taking the time to type \u2018em out, eh? LOL! It was a GREAT weekend, and we caught a mess of fish (and a few turtles). We used worms and shrimp, but the cats were nailing the worms more than the shrimp. Then we cast net for minnows and locked into the bass, with me catching three of them all between 2 and 3 pounds. These are small ponds in the middle of Arlington, TX, where they are building a huge subdivision of houses. For now, they are still open for public fishing. Many beers died in the making of this pictorial. I thought my buddy John would, too, but he lived, lol. First pond we went to \u2013 no luck there. That\u2019s my buddy John John\u2019s dog, Sophie (the mutt) Scenery of pond #1 After no luck there, we hit this here pond It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening.

Man, trash is one of those things that really pizzes me off! I never go out with a buttload of extra trash bags to pick up from the other slobs (and there was a LOT of trash right there). Damn kids. We threw the turtles back, as we did the biggest and smallest fish. Leave the biggest to breed and the smallest to grow up for next trip. All the Carp went back, too, obviously. We caught about 50 all total, not including John's Carp that he accidentally netted cast netting for minnows, lol. We kept 3 Bass, 1 Crappie, and about 8 Channel cats. Everything else was released without injury. And Gar are freshwater fish, but because of their needle teeth they are rarely caught. Guys that actually fish FOR them (they are GREAT fighters!) usually use a minnow-type spinnerbait that they wrap in crochet yarn to snag around their teeth; their mouths are solid bone, so hooks won't catch them, which is why I was so surprised to snag the one I did. I had a hangover for two days, LOL. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

We used worms and shrimp, but the cats were nailing the worms more than the shrimp. Then we cast net for minnows and locked into the bass, with me catching three of them all between 2 and 3 pounds.

Man, trash is one of those things that really pizzes me off! I never go out with a buttload of extra trash bags to pick up from the other slobs (and there was a LOT of trash right there). Damn kids. We threw the turtles back, as we did the biggest and smallest fish. Leave the biggest to breed and the smallest to grow up for next trip. All the Carp went back, too, obviously. We caught about 50 all total, not including John's Carp that he accidentally netted cast netting for minnows, lol. We kept 3 Bass, 1 Crappie, and about 8 Channel cats. Everything else was released without injury. And Gar are freshwater fish, but because of their needle teeth they are rarely caught. Guys that actually fish FOR them (they are GREAT fighters!) usually use a minnow-type spinnerbait that they wrap in crochet yarn to snag around their teeth; their mouths are solid bone, so hooks won't catch them, which is why I was so surprised to snag the one I did.

We used worms and shrimp, but the cats were nailing the worms more than the shrimp. Then we cast net for minnows and locked into the bass, with me catching three of them all between 2 and 3 pounds.

We threw the turtles back, as we did the biggest and smallest fish. Leave the biggest to breed and the smallest to grow up for next trip. All the Carp went back, too, obviously. We caught about 50 all total, not including John's Carp that he accidentally netted cast netting for minnows, lol. We kept 3 Bass, 1 Crappie, and about 8 Channel cats.

Guys that actually fish FOR them (they are GREAT fighters!) usually use a minnow-type spinnerbait that they wrap in crochet yarn to snag around their teeth; their mouths are solid bone, so hooks won't catch them, which is why I was so surprised to snag the one I did.

Caught a 38\" 25 pounder and it is in the freezer (or what is left of it). Darn thing beat the crap outta me! Good day. All fish landed were above 28\" minimum and ranged from 33\" to 40\" and 19 to 28 pounds. Ah, yes; that time of year I will hold a service for the dead beer tomorrow night",
