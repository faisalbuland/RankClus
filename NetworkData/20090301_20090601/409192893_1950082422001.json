Well I do remember writing a piece about Government being a Diamond, not a Rectangle, with Congress at the top, the Presidency and the Supreme Court on the two sides and the People, with their Vote and 2nd Amendment Rights at the bottom. Each of these was supposed to be a \"Check and Balance\" system of Powers and Authorities to keep the other from becoming a Tyranny... CONGRESS passes laws, amends the Constitution, declares War, and has Control over the Money (Taxes) to create and pay for Military, etc etc - - That is a lot of POWER!! The PRESIDENCY can Set Foreign Policy, Wage War with Control of the Military, and Veto Congress - That is a lot of POWER!! The SUPREME COURT can Veto both the President and Congress by declaring actions and laws UNCONSTITUTIONAL, but such a declaration in meaningless unless backed by Congress's cooperation of laws and money, or the President's ability to apply military and legal FORCE - Still, that is a lot of POWER!! The PEOPLE can vote in good people who will not misuse the above POWERS, but if Tyranny still results, an ARMED POPULATION (2nd Amendment) can rise up and put down the Tyranny by Force, Invoking the Introductory Paragraphs of the DECLARATION of INDEPENDENCE!! - That is a lot of POWER!! The worst danger comes from the possibility that the top three parts of the Diamond become so closely nit in one political agenda that they no longer \"Check and Balance\" each other... In other words, the gravest danger to this Country is that the White House, The Senate, The House of Representatives, and the Supreme Court become so aligned with the AGENDA of one Political Party that they virtually become a \"rubber stamp\" for each other. At that point, they would become a Tyrannical Oligarchy, or even a Dictatorship, if all the ideas come from the White House, and everyone else simply sustain those ideas - - I said we were fast approaching that, as the Senate moved closer to a \"non-filibuster\" condition as \"turn-coat\" Arlen Specter switched sides. Now, with the liberal selection of Sotomayor, someone who said before a camera the Federal Appeals Courts \"Make policy\", for Supreme Court - we could be rapidly approaching the Oligarchy... By the way Courts are NEVER to make policy!! They are to judge what is lawful and not lawful... Policy is to be put forward by the President, and established one way or another by debate and passage as law in Congress!! NO ONE can debate any Court action. No ONE can vote for, or vote OUT Federal Judges once they are in place - for LIFE!!

        "content": "Sums it up The Supreme Court high hurdles contest By Michelle Malkin \u2022 May 27, 2009 09:33 AM Able to leap tall life obstacles in a single bound! Not all \u201ccompelling personal stories\u201d are equal by Michelle Malkin <edit> Since when did securing a Supreme Court seat become a high hurdles contest? The White House and Democrats have turned Second Circuit judge Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s nomination into a personal Olympics event. Pay no attention to her jurisprudence. She grew up in a Bronx public housing project. She was diagnosed with childhood diabetes at 8. Her father died a year later. And oh, by the way, did you hear that she was poor? It\u2019s a \u201ccompelling personal story,\u201d as we heard 20,956 times on Tuesday. Sotomayor\u2019s a \u201creal\u201d person. Why, she even read Nancy Drew as a young girl, President Obama told us. She\u2019s \u201cfaced down barriers, overcome the odds and lived out the American dream that brought her parents here so long ago,\u201d Obama said. If Sotomayor were auditioning to be Oprah Winfrey\u2019s fill-in host, I\u2019d understand the over-the-top hyping of her life narrative. But isn\u2019t anybody on Sotomayor\u2019s side the least bit embarrassed by all this liberal condescension? Republicans are not allowed to mention Sotomayor\u2019s ethnicity lest they be branded bigots, but every Democrat on cable television harped on her multicultural \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cobstacle\u201d-climbing. President Obama made sure to roll his r\u2019s when noting that her parents came from Puerrrrto Rrrrico. New York Sen. Schumer stated outright: \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue that a Latino sit on the United States Supreme Court.\u201d Color-coded tokenism dominated the headlines, with blaring references to Sotomayor as the high court\u2019s potential \u201cfirst Hispanic.\u201d (Not true.) Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill \u2013 one of the leading Democrats tasked with guiding Sotomayor through the nomination process \u2014 carried the \u201ccompelling personal story\u201d talking points to the tokenist extreme in an interview on Fox News: \u201cIf you look at what this woman has been through, and the obstacles that she has had to overcome, I think she does have a richly, uniquely American experience that makes her incredibly qualified to pass judgment on some of the most important cases in our country,\u201d McCaskill asserted. \u201cOvercoming incredible odds and I think that is new to the courts. There have been a lot of privileged people that have landed on the Supreme Court. The fact that she has lived the life of the common American, trying to grow up in public housing, reaching for scholarships, reaching for the courtroom as a courtroom prosecutor, all of those things will make her a better and wiser judge. And I don\u2019t think that is identity politics. I think that is the American experience.\u201d Clever. Challenging Sotomayor\u2019s credentials and extreme views on race and the law is not merely anti-Hispanic. It\u2019s anti-American! More significantly, Sen. McCaskill waved the high-hurdle card after being asked to defend Sotomayor\u2019s infamous statement at a 2001 University of California at Berkeley speech asserting brown-skin moral authority: \u201cI would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u2019t lived that life.\u201d McCaskill actually denied that Sotomayor had make the remarks, then argued the words were taken out of context. You want context? It\u2019s even worse than that soundbite. As National Journal legal analyst Stuart Taylor reported, \u201cSotomayor also referred to the cardinal duty of judges to be impartial as a mere \u2018aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others.\u2019 And she suggested that \u2018inherent physiological or cultural differences\u2019 may help explain why \u2018our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.\u2019\u201d The full speech was reprinted in something called the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal. \u201cLa Raza\u201d is Spanish for \u201cThe Race.\u201d Imagine if a white male Republican court nominee had published in a law review called \u201cThe Race.\u201d The selective elevation of hardship-as-primary qualification demeans the entire judiciary. If personal turmoil makes one \u201cincredibly qualified to pass judgment on some of the most important cases in our country,\u201d let\u2019s put reality-show couple Jon and Kate Gosselin on the bench. Millions of viewers tune in to watch their \u201ccompelling personal story\u201d of life with eight children on television. It\u2019s a \u201crichly, uniquely American experience\u201d of facing obstacles and overcoming the odds. Get them robes and gavels, stat. McCaskill\u2019s assertion that \u201covercoming incredible odds\u201d is \u201cnew to the courts\u201d is ridiculous. Is she arguing that Thurgood Marshall, Felix Frankfurter, and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor faced lower hurdles than Sotomayor? And how about Clarence Thomas, a descendant of slaves, grew up in abject poverty in the South without a father. The object lesson, of course, is that not all compelling personal stories are equal. Thomas\u2019s crime, of course, was embracing the wrong ideology. So his incredible set of odds and obstacles don\u2019t count in left-wing eyes. Democrats are eager to celebrate diversity, you see, as long as the diversely-pigmented pledge allegiance to the Left for life.

Get off your horse, tie it up at the post and admit that none of them are worth a shi* and quit being a party hack.",
