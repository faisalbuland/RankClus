John Conyers, with Reverend Al Sharpton and indicted former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick of Detroit. Here's the latest from the cesspool once known as Detroit. Keep it classy, racist Democrats. Detroit News reported: Nowhere is Michigan's brain drain on greater display than in the Detroit City Council chambers. My hopes for Detroit's future faded as I watched the tape of last Tuesday's council meeting, the one that considered the Cobo Center expansion deal. It was a tragic circus, a festival of ignorance that confirmed the No. 1 obstacle to Detroit's progress is the bargain basement leaders that city voters elect. The black nationalism that is now the dominant ideology of the council was on proud display, both at the table and in the audience. Speakers advocating for the deal were taunted by the crowd and cut short by Council President Monica Conyers, who presided over the hearing like an angry bulldog; whites were advised by the citizens to, \"Go home.\" Opponents were allowed to rant and ramble on uninterrupted about \"those people\" who want to steal Detroit's assets and profit from the city's labors. A pitiful Teamster official who practically crawled to the table on his knees expressing profuse respect for this disrespectful body was battered by both the crowd and the council. When he dared suggest that an improved Cobo Center would create more good-paying jobs for union workers, Conyers reminded him, \"Those workers look like you; they don't look like me.\" Desperate, he invoked President Barack Obama's message of unity and was angrily warned, \"Don't yousay his name here.\" Juxtapose the place and the faces and imagine a white Livonia City Council treating a black union representative with such overt racial hostility. The Justice Department would swoop down like a hawk, and the Rev. Al Sharpton would clog Five Mile Road with protesters.",

I sympathize with my black friends who at this time are suffering from some embarrassment over this discriminating city council. Detroit needs leaders who are interested in leading the people into the future and not the past. It's a shame that this kind of thing can be allowed to happen when the current President shares a heritage with people who would wreck his plan for a racially unified and prosperous AMERICA.

I was still in school but worked at a store in Hackensack, NJ. that sold, among other things, guns. We were told to remove all guns and ammo and be prepared to close. Yeah right, we laid in a big supply of food and whatever else we needed. Than we loaded up all of the biggest nastiest weapons we had and made them easily reachable. Fortunately the riots didn't come to Hackensack. There was a nearby city by the name of Patterson, NJ. Patterson was very much like Detroit. When the rioters started massing, the mayor was ready. He had the entire police department heavy armed as was he. He stood in the middle of the street and said that they would make no effort at any riot control. His people would simply shoot and shoot to kill. The last thing he said was that he would be the one to fire the first shot. Guess what?

When he dared suggest that an improved Cobo Center would create more good-paying jobs for union workers, Conyers reminded him, \"Those workers look like you; they don't look like me.\" Desperate, he invoked President Barack Obama's message of unity and was angrily warned, \"Don't yousay his name here.\" Juxtapose the place and the faces and imagine a white Livonia City Council treating a black union representative with such overt racial hostility.

A pitiful Teamster official who practically crawled to the table on his knees expressing profuse respect for this disrespectful body was battered by both the crowd and the council. When he dared suggest that an improved Cobo Center would create more good-paying jobs for union workers, Conyers reminded him, \"Those workers look like you; they don't look like me.\" Desperate, he invoked President Barack Obama's message of unity and was angrily warned, \"Don't yousay his name here.\" Juxtapose the place and the faces and imagine a white Livonia City Council treating a black union representative with such overt racial hostility. The Justice Department would swoop down like a hawk, and the Rev. Al Sharpton would clog Five Mile Road with protesters.",

However, I must say that it infuriates me to know that white-against-black racism would be prosecuted, but black-against-white racism is ignored by the legal system. The simple fact is that the color of your skin, whatever color it may be, does not make you immune from being a racist azzhole.",

How honestly you've earned what you have is of NO importance whatsoever. Socialism cares not about that. Its goal is \"Robbin' the 'hood\". plain and simple. Take from those who work and give to those who won't work. Punish success and hard work with 'legalized' theft. That's a recipe for our future, huh? Just read the Communist Manifesto, and see what is being planned for us from the top down. Think I'm joking? Check it out. It will shock you with each incremental step, now being implemented by a devious Democrat(and some Judas Republicans) near you. You've been warned. All one has to do is look back on the legislation over the last 30 years or so; Chuck Schumer and Boxer, Feinstein, Kennedy's and numerous traitorous others' vehemently anti-gun votes; the Brady Bill, The now-defunct Clinton Gun Ban, Eric Holder's illegal, blatantly unconstitutional stance on guns (violates his Oath of Office), Obama's anti-gun stance, the patently unfair \"Fairness Doctrine\", the central banking system(Federal Reserve) and the mess its created; I can go on and on. Check the historic records and do the math---you'll see. Government wants to dictate how and what we drive, what we eat, and how we earn and spend our money, and it wants us to gladly pay the huge costs of this unaccountable and ever larger monstrosity Obama & Co have injected monetary steroids into repeatedly, giving America a figurative \"middle finger\" and lying to us all the while. How stupid do these folks think we are? It's only a matter of time. This is NOT \"Change we can believe in\" or \"Change we need\".",
