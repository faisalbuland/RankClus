Our miliatry procurment officials are led around by the nose by aircraft manufacturers. And they've been know to take a bribe or two. Stop with the new toys. First off, Boeing says the modified F-15 is aimed at foreign markets, not USAF needs. What does the Osprey have to do with fighters? B-1 is approaching 25 years old. Design goes back another 10-15. B-2 is not far behind and there are only 20 of them. Look at acft F-35 and F-22 are to replace. That will give you an indication of need. Research new Chinese, Russian, and even DPRK fighters. The advantage we once held is not so clear cut anymore. US force have not had to fight under a hostile sky for over 60 years. Do you prefer to return to that if a major conflict should happen along? Too many people think of high-tech weapons as toys. They are not. The weapons are meant to keep the advantage with us. It is interesting that the same \"toy\" mentality was applied to the F-15, F-16, B-1, B-2, B-52, M-1, AH-64, etc. All of which are performing missions as we speak.",
