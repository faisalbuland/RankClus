It is still the best, the finest, and the most powerful and respected Naval Surface Force in the world. Regardless of who is president, our US Navy will NEVER take a back seat to any other. The LCS program has gone WAY over budget. These issues are well-documented; no need to repeat them here. And the contracts were suspended by the Navy under the Bush Administration, which -- IMO -- was a wise move. Anybody want to do their own research on what has plagued the USS SAN ANTONIO? Their issues are legion, and began -- again! -- during the Bush Adminsitration, though I can assure you GWB was in no way responsible. But is just one ship! Only ONE in the world's best Navy. And yet you all spool up over it... It chaps my hide to read crap like, \"U.S. sea power today is \"on a bad glide slope.\" And nothing burns me up more than people who believe it! Couldn't agree more. I find it funny that people want to talk about LPD-17 or the LCS, but do not even consider the success of the DDG-51, new SSN (USS Virginia)class, or any other program that is going well. Scrap LCS and go with a new multi-purpose frigate for the mission.",
