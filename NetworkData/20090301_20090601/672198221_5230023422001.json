As a Registered Nurse, yes even Trauma (E.R./Flight Nurse) I know that CT and CT only can yield these results. MRI with metal is a no no. Although OPEN MRI is now available, it is more bulky and expensive. These brave soldiers died for their country yet continue to help their brethren. Aside from the Technical aspects of the article, it is also touching. I shed tears shed for our fallen. As a gal..i say tears, but the guys often say eye sweat. I understand that. Once again..Thanks.
