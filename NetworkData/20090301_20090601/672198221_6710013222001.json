Maybe it's just me but doesn't it seem par for the course for a repub to make another asinine association that makes no sense at all. Rep. Joe Barton likens BCS football to 'communism' Texas Rep. Joe Barton likened college football's Bowl Championship Series to \"communism\" Friday, even as he made the case that the system is what it is because of money. In his opening remarks during a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's commerce, trade and consumer protection subcommittee, Barton \u2014 the panel's ranking Republican \u2014 recalled the hearing he held on the same matter several years ago. \"That time, I had hoped through a spirit of volunteerism, the BCS would decide to go to a playoff system,\" he said. \"That hasn't happened yet. It is interesting that people of good will \u2014 I think everybody on whatever side of the issue is a person of good will \u2014 keeps trying to tinker with the current system.\" \"It's like communism, you can't fix it.\" Friday's hearing was the latest chapter in a long-running debate on the equitability \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of the Division I college football post season. That debate was supposed to have been quelled when the BCS system was instituted 11 years. Currently, 11 college conferences participate in D1 football. But of those, only six are guaranteed spots in the four BCS games at the conclusion of the year. Notre Dame, which is unaffiliated with any conference, still receives $1.4 million from the BCS annually, and can participate in a BCS bowl if it is rated high enough in the BCS ranking system. Schools from leagues such as the Mountain West Conference, the Western Athletic Conference and the Mid-American Conference have to fight their way into the four prestige games. They share in significantly less of the BCS cash and have less of an opportunity to challenge for the national championship. Witnesses at Friday's hearing included BCS coordinator John Swofford and Alamo Bowl President Derrick Fox \u2014 who defended the current system \u2014 and Mountain West Conference Commissioner Craig Thompson and Boise State Athletic Director Gene Bleymaier, who advocated a change. While acknowledging that no mechanism will ever be perfect, without controversy or ambiguity, Swofford defended the BCS on capitalistic grounds. http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/21989.html http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztWDefIlFw",

For instance, every dollar they receive from us for, say, construction of some facility, frees up a dollar for them to use buying their way into the BCS. So, since every tax dollar is allocated by Congress, I guess they do have a right to explore how it's spent and where it goes.",
