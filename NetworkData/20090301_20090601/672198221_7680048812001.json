This is different from what Mr. Bush (or his staff) was accused of doing, which was selecting INDIVIDUALS that seemed to always ask \"soft\" questions and never picking individuals that had asked any \"hard\" questions in the past.",

In fact, there is no way the internet would have ever emerged without Al Gore. Nice critical thinking you just implemented.",

And even bigger issue is that during the newpaper \"consolidation\" period most of the newspaper ended up with a LOT of debt. Groups borrowed money to buy the paper and then other groups borrowed even more money to buy them again, etc. Many of the \"failing\" newspapers would be profitable if they did not have to pay the interest much less the principle on the loans used to churn ownership. IMO the ONLY people that usually profit from most mergers and acquistions are the lawyers, the Wall street brokers and the banks. This message has been edited.
