I'm not going to look it up to find out**> Subject: PLEASE REPLY ASAP To: __________ @yahoo.com Date: Saturday, April 18, 2009, 5:52 AM Dear Friend My name is Sgt. Amy Robinson. I am an American soldier with Swiss background, serving in the military with the army 3rd infantry division. With a very desperate need for assistance, I have summed up courage to contact you. I found your contact particulars in an address journal. I am seeking your kind assistance to move the sum of ($3.2 million u.s. dollars)three million, two hundred united states dollars to you, as far as I can be assured that my share will be safe in your care until I complete my service here, this is no stolen money, and there are no danger involved. I am presently in a hospital recovering from injuries sustained in a suicide bomb attack. Source of money: Some money in various currencies was discovered in barrels at a farmhouse near one of Saddam's old palaces in Tikrit-Iraq during a rescue operation, and it was agreed by staff Sgt Kenneth buff and I that some part of this money be shared among both of us before informing anybody about it since both of us saw the money first. This was quite an illegal thing to do, but I tell you what? No compensation can make up for the risk we have taken with our lives in this hellhole. Of which my brother in-law was killed by a road side bomb last week. Please view website for confirmation; ....http://www.voanews.com/burmese/archive/2003-04/a-2003-04-20-1-1.cfm.... The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a British contact working here and his office enjoy some immunity, I was able to move the money to a security company in bangkok thailand as a diplomatic baggage. They are now waiting for us to provide the name of beneficiary who they will transfer the funds to. The reason i want you to claim the funds on my behalf is that as a soldier, i cannot present a concrete evidence on how i made such a big amount of money down here. Besides the US Government is trying their best to keep their eyes on soldiers here inorder to effect a high level of discipline among us.The moment i am sure that you are willing to assist me, i will give you the information of the security company and the security code of the baggage.I want you to tell me how much you will take from this money for the assistance you will give to me. One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this matter with anybody, should you have reasons to reject this offer, please and please destroy this message as any leakage of this information will be too bad for us soldiers here in Iraq. I do not know how long we will remain here, and i have been shot, wounded and survived two suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other reasons i will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help, i honestly want this matter to be resolved immediately, please contact me as soon aspossible, my only way of communication is email. Yours in Service.
