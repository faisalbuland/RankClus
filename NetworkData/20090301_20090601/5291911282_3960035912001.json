I'm hoping many of you would like to input some advice or other wise words for my next article. The article will be about joining any branch of the military directly after high school. I am currently a senior and have enlisted in the Army myself. This was a huge decision for me and I know many of my classmates are considering the same. I would like opinions on all sides of this topic, the good and the bad. Such as- the education and skills you receive in the military are invaluable when you join the civilian work force. Or- high school students cannot reasonably make the decision to join the military at their age. Because this is an article please include military branch, rank, full name. If you would not like your name used, I would still like to use your branch and rank. But please let me know if you want anything withheld. Thank you in advance for all of your responses. Beth",

It's not the norm, most folks serve before they've finished college, and a lot who do join after college go the officer route. But my Platoon had five or six guys with full four year degrees, and two or three with Master's. Military intelligence is a weird part of the Army though. I went to college first because my parents warned me that if you put it off, life tends to take off - ie, you end up married, with kids, and not a lot of time to use up GI Bill benefits before they expire. That's what happened to them. I enlisted because the Army agreed to pay all my Federal student loans back, and because I honestly don't think I'm good leadership material. I can organize things very well, but I'm not overly confident in directing people around, especially back when I joined up at the age of 21! SO basically, I recommend that people take a year or two of courses or training before enlisting, if they can afford it. It gives you some maturity and life experience, ESPECIALLY useful for young women (you'll hear every line in the book from young GIs, girls, it helps to be a year or two older so you've heard some of it before you show up in a line unit!) Plus, you won't have to worry about being underage while everyone else is out drinking. But that's just one argument, you could argue the other way, that the MILITARY grants you all the maturity and life experience you could ask for, plus you can take courses while serving. Plus, I think the new GI Bill gives you 15 years to use up benefits. If you do enlist out of high school, take courses while you are on Active Duty using tuition assistance. You don't need a four-year degree to make it in the world. But you do need some kind of a marketable trade or skill. That's a fact. (Indeed, an experienced plumber or electrician will make more money than an English major, ask my poor younger brother!)",

Her two daughters are now in the military (active duty AF and CG reserve \u2013 both of them in training right now). But both of them waited until they finished college. I would suggest seriously that you seek the input of your parents and favorite teachers and your minister, if you have one.

I remained in the Navy until 6 April 2007 when I was medically discharged. Two overseas deployments, Navy nuke, and a proud submariner. The Navy worked wonders for me. It made me develope a higher sense of purpose, and instilled more self discipline into me. It let me see parts of the world I would never have been able to otherwise, I made friends that I would and did trust with my life. But here is the stone cold reality. There are many reasons people join the service. Some reasons will serve you better than others. In bootcamp, the CO had a speach he gave that really hit home. Captain O.W. Wright as I recall his name, but some of us called him \"Captain America\" after seeing his pictures. He had a medal rack that could have passed as a menu at a candy store. What he said and asked us was a much more powerful story however. During the Captains Call, he asked a series of questions to be answered by a showing of hands. Things like, \"Who joined the navy to get an education?\" Followed by the other great recruiting slogans of times gone by, like \"See the world\". He had what seemed like a dozen of these, then he asked this question, \"Who joined the navy to go to war and serve their country\", there was only about a dozen hands up out of well over a thousand raw recruits. He looked around, and looked somewhat disappointed. He then gave a short speach about the job of the navy, from showing the flag to shelling a beach, you name it, he mentioned it. Then at the end of it, he said, \"That is now your job, you joined the navy to fight, I'll ask again, who joined the navy to go to war?\" Every hand was up. It was a very moving experience. If someone joins for the enlistment bonus, or the college credit, or any other reason than to serve, the experience of the military is much lessened, and even bitter. One day, the money will be gone, the uniforms will no longer fit, the medals will tarnish. But the results of honorable service remain bright for years to come. I will give the example of my grandfather. He joined the Navy on 4 Dec 1941, three days later, on his birthday, the US entered into world war 2, and he reported to Pensacola for flight training. When he passed away a year and a half ago, he had suffered numerous strokes, and his body was essentially on autopilot for the last three years of his life. His mind would come and go, but I could show him a picture of his plane, his crew, and other relatives that served, and he could remember them all, he told me who they where, what they did, and where each picture was taken, his voice clear and sharp, yet on almost any other subject, he could barely speak, and could not ever remember the day before. The last thing he told me still brings tears to my eyes, he said, \"You did good\" while holding a picture of me in my dress blues from the day a got back from my first deployment. If it hadn't been for the navy, I would never have served my country, I would not have been as close to my grandfather, and I would not have the pride of a job well done to the best of my ability. That is what service is about. Everything else is just a bonus, the college fund, the signing bonus, the education, everything...but the job itself is the true reward of service. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

It's not the norm, most folks serve before they've finished college, and a lot who do join after college go the officer route. But my Platoon had five or six guys with full four year degrees, and two or three with Master's. Military intelligence is a weird part of the Army though. I went to college first because my parents warned me that if you put it off, life tends to take off - ie, you end up married, with kids, and not a lot of time to use up GI Bill benefits before they expire. That's what happened to them. I enlisted because the Army agreed to pay all my Federal student loans back, and because I honestly don't think I'm good leadership material. I can organize things very well, but I'm not overly confident in directing people around, especially back when I joined up at the age of 21! SO basically, I recommend that people take a year or two of courses or training before enlisting, if they can afford it. It gives you some maturity and life experience, ESPECIALLY useful for young women (you'll hear every line in the book from young GIs, girls, it helps to be a year or two older so you've heard some of it before you show up in a line unit!) Plus, you won't have to worry about being underage while everyone else is out drinking. But that's just one argument, you could argue the other way, that the MILITARY grants you all the maturity and life experience you could ask for, plus you can take courses while serving. Plus, I think the new GI Bill gives you 15 years to use up benefits. If you do enlist out of high school, take courses while you are on Active Duty using tuition assistance. You don't need a four-year degree to make it in the world. But you do need some kind of a marketable trade or skill. That's a fact.

Only the self-motivated and tough need apply. Those who wouldn't carry their own load made it bad for everyone, and deserved to have their butts kicked every time they complained or whined. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, because not everyone has the spine and selflessness to measure up. But if they do, they'll grow up fast - - I went in at 18 going on 19.

I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, because not everyone has the spine and selflessness to measure up. But if they do, they'll grow up fast - - I went in at 18 going on 19. I came out 23 going on 45... By the way, I spent the next 30+ years trying to pass on what I'd learned to kids just like you, as a High School English/U S History teacher - - This message has been edited.

One guy I know from my graduating class enlisted upon my recommendation. As far as I know the program no longer exists because of funding. As it was also supposed to include a $2000 bonus to the recommending enlisted member. Because of timing I missed out on the money, but made good on the \"promotion\" (for lack of a better term). I don't think the program will put you above an E-3. And thank you Ruanne for the post.",

It provided a much needed kick in the stern sheets to get me out of mommy/daddy high school crap mode and into the real world. I got to meet a lot of different people and find good in almost all of them. Even first class 455holes provide a valuable learning experience. Kids, OK, young adults these days seem to want to be at home with mommy/daddy school buddies until they're 40 or so years of age. They expect the world to be delivered, gift-wrapped, last Tuesday. The military will introduce them to a reality which is far more universal than whatever they've encountered before. People are good and bad but you can learn to tell the difference. Some places suck more than others but if you learn patience you will get through almost everything unpleasant, getting through the rest requires good buddies to watch your back and expert marksmanship.

        "content": "I signed the dotted line, 23 Oct 2001, and commenced DEP while in high school. One 27 June 2002, I arrived at Great Lakes, Ill for Basic. I remained in the Navy until 6 April 2007 when I was medically discharged. Two overseas deployments, Navy nuke, and a proud submariner. The Navy worked wonders for me. It made me develope a higher sense of purpose, and instilled more self discipline into me. It let me see parts of the world I would never have been able to otherwise, I made friends that I would and did trust with my life. But here is the stone cold reality. There are many reasons people join the service. Some reasons will serve you better than others. In bootcamp, the CO had a speach he gave that really hit home. Captain O.W. Wright as I recall his name, but some of us called him \"Captain America\" after seeing his pictures. He had a medal rack that could have passed as a menu at a candy store. What he said and asked us was a much more powerful story however. During the Captains Call, he asked a series of questions to be answered by a showing of hands. Things like, \"Who joined the navy to get an education?\" Followed by the other great recruiting slogans of times gone by, like \"See the world\". He had what seemed like a dozen of these, then he asked this question, \"Who joined the navy to go to war and serve their country\", there was only about a dozen hands up out of well over a thousand raw recruits. He looked around, and looked somewhat disappointed. He then gave a short speach about the job of the navy, from showing the flag to shelling a beach, you name it, he mentioned it. Then at the end of it, he said, \"That is now your job, you joined the navy to fight, I'll ask again, who joined the navy to go to war?\" Every hand was up. It was a very moving experience. If someone joins for the enlistment bonus, or the college credit, or any other reason than to serve, the experience of the military is much lessened, and even bitter. One day, the money will be gone, the uniforms will no longer fit, the medals will tarnish. But the results of honorable service remain bright for years to come. I will give the example of my grandfather. He joined the Navy on 4 Dec 1941, three days later, on his birthday, the US entered into world war 2, and he reported to Pensacola for flight training. When he passed away a year and a half ago, he had suffered numerous strokes, and his body was essentially on autopilot for the last three years of his life. His mind would come and go, but I could show him a picture of his plane, his crew, and other relatives that served, and he could remember them all, he told me who they where, what they did, and where each picture was taken, his voice clear and sharp, yet on almost any other subject, he could barely speak, and could not ever remember the day before. The last thing he told me still brings tears to my eyes, he said, \"You did good\" while holding a picture of me in my dress blues from the day a got back from my first deployment. If it hadn't been for the navy, I would never have served my country, I would not have been as close to my grandfather, and I would not have the pride of a job well done to the best of my ability. That is what service is about. Everything else is just a bonus, the college fund, the signing bonus, the education, everything...but the job itself is the true reward of service. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",
