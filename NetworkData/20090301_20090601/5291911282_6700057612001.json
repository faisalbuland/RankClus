Jeff Huber has been a regular columnist at Military.com for at least two years (look under the opinion section on this site). I was asking if anyone knew why his recent columns are not on this site, while his archive still is, but he now appears to now writing weekly for Antiwar.com. As a supporter of the military, I appreciate dissident points of view. It is too easy for people to blindly support politicians who care little for our fighting men and women. I hope Huber continues to appear on this site.",
