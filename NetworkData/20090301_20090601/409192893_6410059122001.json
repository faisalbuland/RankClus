Obama bows to a king and offers some apologies for some past American screw ups and you condemn his entire presidency after 100 days? When he starts a couple of wars and falls asleep at the wheel of national security, we\u2019ll talk. Do you view Bush as successful? After all, he presided over the biggest intelligence failure in American history resulting in 3000 Americans being killed in the twin towers, sent us to war after phantom WMD's, failed to finish Afghanistan, destroyed America's reputation by torturing prisoners, denying them due process and generally being a ******bag. Who knows how many moderate Muslims became extremist as a result of his administration. Don't forget he destroyed our economy, told the terrorist to \"bring it on\". Cripes, the list goes on and on of less than desirable \"records\" to have associated with ones administration. I can't imagine the feeling one must have knowing they voted for that inept dude and all the death and destruction that came with him. Tough to sleep at night???",
