I am sure that the military wants their statistics to read that way. They have not spoken to my friends who are divorced and separated due to PTSD and the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. My husband is an officer stationed in Afghanistan on his third tour. He handed me a legal separation two weeks before he left. He came home with horrible signs of PTSD after his second tour in Iraq. Many of his friends and I begged him to get help. But he kept saying the docs didn't know what they were talking about and he would be ok. Well he is not. We have been toghether for 23 years married for 21. A solid and healthy marriage until the war. My best friend, our best friends, married for 24 years all military, he retired had horrible PTSD and left one day never to return. We have at least 20 couples that we can think of right now. Married over 20 years, some recently retired or at the retirement point. Strong healthy military families. Now all seperated or divorced. Lives ruined. The military spouses were all the ones to leave...all from this hateful awful war and no one getting treatment. The stats are wrong. You are all kidding yourselves if you think they aren't. PTSD shows up sometimes unnoticed and grabs the soul. Those are the stories you all aren't hearing about. The Army needs to track recent retirees or those who are no longer in service that have been to this war. I would bet the numbers are a lot higher. I have been a familiy support group leader, a commander's wife, an OWC president. I have been a part of the FSG groups and done a lot of work with them. They can try and help the military spouses....but the soldier with the PTSD has to want the help. There is no reasoning with them. The laws need to change so that all soldiers redeploying go through a year of mandatory psychotherapy. The six hours that they are given the first week of redeployment doesn't work. I saw the signs, my parents are both psychologists, but there is nothing we can do as spouses unless the military gets its act together and takes care of the problem that they know that they have...and quite frankly I think they want to cover it up and sweep it all under the rug. I have been at this way too long and know there are some large pieces missing in this puzzle.",

I found this on the Fort Lewis webpage, and discovered that it's the standard poster for the Family Covenant program for the whole Army: I see a bunch of cute white babies. I see the no women in uniform. The only adult male not standing in uniform must be about 80 years old. I see only one black person, who is standing in the back looking morose, with no obvious family member accompanying him unless his baby is albino and his Caucasian wife simply isn't obviously standing next to him. So, all the good wives and children of this program are white, the only black guy is single, and the soldiers are all men. And they say stereotypes are dead. I'm usually not PC, but really, this was so freakin' obvious that it's kinda disturbing. Anyway, as for the divorce rate... *shakes head* Sad. Really sad.",
