Unlike other NATO countries, Canada has no policy on humanitarian immigration for local staff -- but that's about to change. Afghans who have been severely injured working with the Canadian military, or who can prove they face threats, will be eligible for fast-track entry. (...) The new program will be open to anyone with 12 months' service to the Canadian mission, medical and security checks, and a recommendation letter from a senior soldier or diplomat. (...) \"But in particular circumstances where we feel that a person's safety will be jeopardized by staying in the country, the door will be open to Canada. ... \"I think Canadians would be proud to help provide refuge to those who have helped our forces, aid personnel and diplomats.\" Kenney said he expects hundreds of Afghan employees to benefit from the program, along with their immediate families. Insurgents have gone to gruesome lengths to make an example of locals who work with NATO. In one case, several interpreters' bodies were strung up in a public square and left to rot there for weeks as a lesson to anyone else thinking of helping the foreigners. Government officials say the program is inspired by similar ones in the United States, Britain, Australia and Denmark. Officials say they would receive many of the same services as refugees: income support for 12 months, health benefits and help preparing a CV and finding work. (...)",

What will a Pashtun tribal fighter do here if he doesn't 'fit' into the Afghan community? Think they'd stretch legion membership to accommodate their 'service'?
