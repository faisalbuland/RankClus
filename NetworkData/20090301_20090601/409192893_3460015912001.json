First lady Michelle Obama breaks ground for the White House Kitchen Garden with the help of local students The students from nearby Bancroft Elementary School will help grow fifty-five kinds of vegetables, herbs and berries. They will plant organic seedlings in a few weeks. The White House will provide organic fertilizer for the garden. Crops will include lettuce, spinach, broccoli, peas, onions and berries. Missus Obama said two beehives will provide honey. The whole Obama family, including the president, will pull weeds in the garden. The total cost of the seedlings and fertilizer is two hundred dollars. \"http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/2009-03-30-voa3.cfm\" It is pesticide free too! How awesome is that?",
