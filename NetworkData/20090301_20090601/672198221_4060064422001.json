Sgt. Maj. Bob Haverback of Headquarters Company, 2nd Squadron, 106th Cavalry, said the Kewanee Guardsman\u2019s family was notified at 3 p.m. Tuesday and that the name is being withheld until the families of all four soldiers have been contacted. Even though the soldier\u2019s name has been generally circulated in Kewanee, Haverback said the Army has a policy of not announcing the names of casualties until at least 24 hours after the family has been notified to give them some privacy. \u201cWe feel they need some time to themselves, but if they wish to make an announcement, it\u2019s up to them,\u201d said Haverback. However, the MySpace page of 25-year-old Schuyler Patch, who began his second tour in October, has a number of messages of sympathy posted by friends. Patch was a graduate of Wethersfield High School and was serving as a gunner with the guard unit. In addition, messages of sympathy are posted in his hometown, such as a sign at the Shell gas station at Main and Prospect streets that lists Patch\u2019s name. Haverback said two of the four casualties were members of the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team made up entirely of Illinois Army National Guardsmen sent to Afghanistan to mentor Afghan police and Army personnel and provide force protection. He said this is the seventh casualty the 33rd BCT has sustained since beginning the mission last year. Aaron Carlson of Annawan, a member of the Galva National Guard unit also serving in Afghanistan, was seriously injured when a suicide car bomb detonated near his post on Jan. 17. He is now receiving treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s been a mild winter in Afghanistan, and they (the Taliban) are taking advantage of it,\u201d said Haverback. This is the first soldier from Kewanee killed in combat since the Vietnam War. http://www.ok-jordan.com",
