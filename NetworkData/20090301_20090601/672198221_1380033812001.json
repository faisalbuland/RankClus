To put it another way, the South Koreans are not terribly happy when people here start talking about defending America to the last Korean. This is a case of defending Japan and the United States and anyone in the range of the despots missiles... Personally, I think that the missile will be tracked and if it's flight path is over Japan or it appears headed towards U.S. territory or both, it may just be shot down... The DPRK is about broke, it's people are starving and may well be on it's last legs... It's major strength is it's army and it may be reaching a point of \"use it or loose it\" and this may be a deliberate provocation by the DPRK, so that they will have an excuse, in at least their minds, to use it... If it comes to another confrontation and I honestly hope not, I hope the Korean people and the American people have the will and the where with all to fight it to a final conclusion. I have not been to South Korea and only know what I read about the situation... I defer to others, who have the experience on the subject... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

Just a bunch of stupid nonsense...shoot the missle down, LOL... Uh, sure... If ya say so... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 This is a long-standing concern of the ROK, because they know they will be mostly the ones that have to live (or die) with the consequences of our actions. Seoul is only 12 miles from the DMZ. The ROK has always been cautious about reacting to DPRK provocations because of that. To put it another way, the South Koreans are not terribly happy when people here start talking about defending America to the last Korean.", 
        "reply": " This is a case of defending Japan and the United States and anyone in the range of the despots missiles... Personally, I think that the missile will be tracked and if it's flight path is over Japan or it appears headed towards U.S. territory or both, it may just be shot down... The DPRK is about broke, it's people are starving and may well be on it's last legs... It's major strength is it's army and it may be reaching a point of \"use it or loose it\" and this may be a deliberate provocation by the DPRK, so that they will have an excuse, in at least their minds, to use it... If it comes to another confrontation and I honestly hope not, I hope the Korean people and the American people have the will and the where with all to fight it to a final conclusion. I have not been to South Korea and only know what I read about the situation... I defer to others, who have the experience on the subject... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

        "reply": " Of course they are aware of that. But they are also aware that they have 48 million Korean civilians to worry about, a quarter of which are in/around Seoul. Should we decide to pack up our troops tomorrow, the Koreans will still be there. If anyone should make the call as to when & if we go to war with the DPRK, it should be them, because the ROK has far more at stake than we do.",

Just a bunch of stupid nonsense...shoot the missle down, LOL... Uh, sure... If ya say so... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 This is a long-standing concern of the ROK, because they know they will be mostly the ones that have to live (or die) with the consequences of our actions. Seoul is only 12 miles from the DMZ. The ROK has always been cautious about reacting to DPRK provocations because of that. To put it another way, the South Koreans are not terribly happy when people here start talking about defending America to the last Korean. This is a case of defending Japan and the United States and anyone in the range of the despots missiles... Personally, I think that the missile will be tracked and if it's flight path is over Japan or it appears headed towards U.S. territory or both, it may just be shot down... The DPRK is about broke, it's people are starving and may well be on it's last legs... It's major strength is it's army and it may be reaching a point of \"use it or loose it\" and this may be a deliberate provocation by the DPRK, so that they will have an excuse, in at least their minds, to use it... If it comes to another confrontation and I honestly hope not, I hope the Korean people and the American people have the will and the where with all to fight it to a final conclusion. I have not been to South Korea and only know what I read about the situation... I defer to others, who have the experience on the subject... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
