In response to your second point quote: The Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested 60 suspected illegal immigrants in a raid of a landscape company that is under contract with the county on Wednesday. According to a press release from the sheriff\u2019s office, 40 employees of H.M.I. Handyman Inc., 2646 S. 19th Ave. in Phoenix, were arrested on suspicion of identity theft and forgery and 20 for immigration violations. Sheriff Joe Arpaio said investigators were tipped off in October by a former employee of the company who alleged that many of the workers were illegal immigrants. Deputies served search warrants on the company to seize business records. The company is under contract to service several county buildings throughout the Valley. \"http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/135329\" quote: The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office raided a Scottsdale furniture business today and arrested 12 out of 20 employees, according Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
