(AP) \u2014 Republicans can reach a broader base by recasting gay marriage as an issue that could dent pocketbooks as small businesses spend more on health care and other benefits, GOP Chairman Michael Steele said Saturday. Steele said that was just an example of how the party can retool its message to appeal to young voters and minorities without sacrificing core conservative principles. Steele said he used the argument weeks ago while chatting on a flight with a college student who described herself as fiscally conservative but socially liberal on issues like gay marriage. \"Now all of a sudden I've got someone who wasn't a spouse before, that I had no responsibility for, who is now getting claimed as a spouse that I now have financial responsibility for,\" Steele told Republicans at the state convention in traditionally conservative Georgia. \"So how do I pay for that? Who pays for that? You just cost me money.\" As Steele talked about ways the party could position itself, he also poked fun at his previous pledge to give the GOP a \"hip-hop makeover.\" \"You don't have to wear your pants cut down here or the big bling,\" he said. Vermont and Iowa have legalized gay marriage in recent weeks, and a Quinnipiac University poll released in April found that 57 percent of people questioned support civil unions that provide marriage-like rights. Although 55 percent said they opposed gay marriage, the poll indicated a shift toward more acceptance. \"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hj-3T1zeVD9FsoDI8hSNGqd2Rs-QD987ERJO1\" Apparently Chairman Steele did not read this: \"http://www.forbes.com/2004/04/05/cx_al_0405gaymarriage.html\"",

Turned out they didn't need to!! It's the same old playbook from the last fifty years!! We have nothing to sell, but fear itself!! So after changing the \"Modern Liberal\" tag for 'Progressives\" get out there and sell it they did!! LUCKY US!!! Can we say......suckers!!!!!!",

As long as the GOP has such alliances with groups such as Reverend Dobson's \"Focus on the Family,\" the party will just continue to be looked upon as Bible Thumpers. Looking at such things from the other side of the isle, my best advice to the GOP would be to lose the Bibles ASAP, and to try to STOP being the party of NO.
