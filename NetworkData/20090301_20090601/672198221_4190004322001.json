Graham talking about the notebooks and other things in 2005. http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=509202 Graham: CIA was 'loose with the facts' about interrogation briefings By Nathan Crabbe Sun staff writer Published: Friday, May 15, 2009 at 4:42 p.m. Last Modified: Friday, May 15, 2009 at 4:42 p.m. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham said Friday that his detailed diaries show Democrats were told less about the interrogation of terrorists than the CIA claims. Graham said the CIA claimed he was briefed four times about extreme interrogation techniques as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said he called the head of archives at the University of Florida, where his notebooks are stored, to check if he had listed the briefings. \"We established that three out of four of these alleged briefings never took place,\" he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been under fire this week about her knowledge of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, which some have deemed torture. While the CIA has said she was fully briefed about the methods, Pelosi said she was briefed once and misled about the use of waterboarding. For his part, Graham said he doesn't recall being told about waterboarding or other extreme techniques in his briefing. He believes that \"misinformation is out there\" based on his experience. \"I think the Republican-led CIA of that era, among other things, was loose with the facts and loose with the record,\" he said. Graham, Florida governor from 1989 1979 to 1987 and U.S. senator from 1987 to 2005, is the namesake of UF's Graham Center for Public Service. He donated his notebooks to the university, but they are currently unavailable to the public. Carl Van Ness, UF historian and curator of archives and manuscripts, said the notebooks contain incredibly detailed, almost minute-by-minute, logs of Graham's activities. He said they also include nearly everything Graham put into his pockets that day. \"I've never seen anything like it as an archivist,\" he said. Van Ness said an issue with tax laws, involving whether the records are available to the public, has kept the notebooks under seal. He said he only accesses the notebooks at Graham's instruction. \"At his request, we'll break the seal,\" he said. He said one of the notebooks that Graham sought had been loaned to the former senator, but the others were in the archives. He said he couldn't comment about what they said. Graham said the CIA reported he was briefed twice in April 2002 and twice in September 2002. But he said the notebooks show he was briefed just once, on Sept. 27 of that year. http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090515/ARTICLES/905159954/1002 You say he has a bad memory, but his keeping track of his daily schedule for years would add a completely different perspective to that.

Actually Panetta IS questioning the accuracy of those documents in a letter here: This letter presents the most thorough information we have on dates, locations, and names of all Members of Congress who were briefed by the CIA on enhanced interrogation techniques. This information, however, is drawn from the past files of the CIA and represents MFRs completed at the time and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals. In the end, you and the Committee will have to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened. We can make the MFRs available at CIA for staff review. \"http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2009-05-06-reyes-eit-letter0001.pdf\" From the other letter you linked to: quote: Since the Central Intelligence Agency provided the Committee an interim list of Members briefed on April 22, Director Panetta and his staff have conducted a painstaking and thorough review of over seven years' of records The result of this effort is enclosed. It provides a straightforward account of the extent of interaction with the Congress on this issue. Think I will take the word of the man who looked through seven years of records, has nothing to gain from saying his agency didn't lie, and is a career Democrat over \"flip flopper\" Pelosi. Why are you posting the first part of the letter, when Panetta is questioning the ACCURACY of those records in the second part of the letter? He clearly states that the information is based on \"Memorandums of Records and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals.\" That means the records were recorded later, not during the actual meetings. Did you see the enclosures included with Panetta's letter? No? Well neither did I because they are classified. Nowhere in his cover letter does he \"question\" the accuracy of the letter he only states that they come from MFRs and that the committee will have to decide if it is accurate or not. If Panetta didn't know for a fact that Pelosi was there why did he release his letter to his employees and the press yesterday? Even more important is why did Pelosi then change her stance that the CIA lied once he did release his letter? She is lying, you know she is lying, but unlike Panetta, you are letting your partisanship blind you.",

Graham talking about the notebooks and other things in 2005. http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=509202 Graham: CIA was 'loose with the facts' about interrogation briefings By Nathan Crabbe Sun staff writer Published: Friday, May 15, 2009 at 4:42 p.m. Last Modified: Friday, May 15, 2009 at 4:42 p.m. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham said Friday that his detailed diaries show Democrats were told less about the interrogation of terrorists than the CIA claims. Graham said the CIA claimed he was briefed four times about extreme interrogation techniques as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said he called the head of archives at the University of Florida, where his notebooks are stored, to check if he had listed the briefings. \"We established that three out of four of these alleged briefings never took place,\" he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been under fire this week about her knowledge of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, which some have deemed torture. While the CIA has said she was fully briefed about the methods, Pelosi said she was briefed once and misled about the use of waterboarding. For his part, Graham said he doesn't recall being told about waterboarding or other extreme techniques in his briefing. He believes that \"misinformation is out there\" based on his experience. \"I think the Republican-led CIA of that era, among other things, was loose with the facts and loose with the record,\" he said. Graham, Florida governor from 1989 1979 to 1987 and U.S. senator from 1987 to 2005, is the namesake of UF's Graham Center for Public Service. He donated his notebooks to the university, but they are currently unavailable to the public. Carl Van Ness, UF historian and curator of archives and manuscripts, said the notebooks contain incredibly detailed, almost minute-by-minute, logs of Graham's activities. He said they also include nearly everything Graham put into his pockets that day. \"I've never seen anything like it as an archivist,\" he said. Van Ness said an issue with tax laws, involving whether the records are available to the public, has kept the notebooks under seal. He said he only accesses the notebooks at Graham's instruction. \"At his request, we'll break the seal,\" he said. He said one of the notebooks that Graham sought had been loaned to the former senator, but the others were in the archives. He said he couldn't comment about what they said. Graham said the CIA reported he was briefed twice in April 2002 and twice in September 2002. But he said the notebooks show he was briefed just once, on Sept. 27 of that year. http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090515/ARTICLES/905159954/1002 You say he has a bad memory, but his keeping track of his daily schedule for years would add a completely different perspective to that. Wouldn\u2019t you say? If you write everything down, where\u2019s the need to remember it? By the way, got any links to your assertion that he has a memory problem?",

Graham talking about the notebooks and other things in 2005. http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=509202 Graham: CIA was 'loose with the facts' about interrogation briefings By Nathan Crabbe Sun staff writer Published: Friday, May 15, 2009 at 4:42 p.m. Last Modified: Friday, May 15, 2009 at 4:42 p.m. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham said Friday that his detailed diaries show Democrats were told less about the interrogation of terrorists than the CIA claims. Graham said the CIA claimed he was briefed four times about extreme interrogation techniques as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said he called the head of archives at the University of Florida, where his notebooks are stored, to check if he had listed the briefings. \"We established that three out of four of these alleged briefings never took place,\" he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been under fire this week about her knowledge of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, which some have deemed torture. While the CIA has said she was fully briefed about the methods, Pelosi said she was briefed once and misled about the use of waterboarding. For his part, Graham said he doesn't recall being told about waterboarding or other extreme techniques in his briefing. He believes that \"misinformation is out there\" based on his experience. \"I think the Republican-led CIA of that era, among other things, was loose with the facts and loose with the record,\" he said. Graham, Florida governor from 1989 1979 to 1987 and U.S. senator from 1987 to 2005, is the namesake of UF's Graham Center for Public Service. He donated his notebooks to the university, but they are currently unavailable to the public. Carl Van Ness, UF historian and curator of archives and manuscripts, said the notebooks contain incredibly detailed, almost minute-by-minute, logs of Graham's activities. He said they also include nearly everything Graham put into his pockets that day. \"I've never seen anything like it as an archivist,\" he said. Van Ness said an issue with tax laws, involving whether the records are available to the public, has kept the notebooks under seal. He said he only accesses the notebooks at Graham's instruction. \"At his request, we'll break the seal,\" he said. He said one of the notebooks that Graham sought had been loaned to the former senator, but the others were in the archives. He said he couldn't comment about what they said. Graham said the CIA reported he was briefed twice in April 2002 and twice in September 2002. But he said the notebooks show he was briefed just once, on Sept. 27 of that year. http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090515/ARTICLES/905159954/1002 You say he has a bad memory, but his keeping track of his daily schedule for years would add a completely different perspective to that. Wouldn\u2019t you say? If you write everything down, where\u2019s the need to remember it? By the way, got any links to your assertion that he has a memory problem?",

Bob Graham was able to prove that the dates given in the CIA's Unclassified memos were inaccurate. Something that the CIA said was a possibility in the letter that accompanied the memos. Panetta has access to ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS from those briefings and he says his agency, THAT HE JUST TOOK OVER, is telling the truth about the briefings that happened under a Republican administration. What possible reason would the CIA Director have for lying? If his agency was wrong all he has to do is point to the previous administration. If he needs to learn how to look backwards and lay blame, I am sure there are plenty of other Dems in D.C. that are willing to teach him how to do just that. And if Pelosi isn't lying, why has her story changed five times over the past couple of weeks? Uh, no. Actually Panetta IS questioning the accuracy of those documents in a letter here: This letter presents the most thorough information we have on dates, locations, and names of all Members of Congress who were briefed by the CIA on enhanced interrogation techniques. This information, however, is drawn from the past files of the CIA and represents MFRs completed at the time and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals. In the end, you and the Committee will have to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened. We can make the MFRs available at CIA for staff review. \"http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2009-05-06-reyes-eit-letter0001.pdf\" From the other letter you linked to: quote: Since the Central Intelligence Agency provided the Committee an interim list of Members briefed on April 22, Director Panetta and his staff have conducted a painstaking and thorough review of over seven years' of records The result of this effort is enclosed. It provides a straightforward account of the extent of interaction with the Congress on this issue. Think I will take the word of the man who looked through seven years of records, has nothing to gain from saying his agency didn't lie, and is a career Democrat over \"flip flopper\" Pelosi. Why are you posting the first part of the letter, when Panetta is questioning the ACCURACY of those records in the second part of the letter? He clearly states that the information is based on \"Memorandums of Records and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals.\" That means the records were recorded later, not during the actual meetings.",

Nowhere in his cover letter does he \"question\" the accuracy of the letter he only states that they come from MFRs and that the committee will have to decide if it is accurate or not. If Panetta didn't know for a fact that Pelosi was there why did he release his letter to his employees and the press yesterday? Even more important is why did Pelosi then change her stance that the CIA lied once he did release his letter? She is lying, you know she is lying, but unlike Panetta, you are letting your partisanship blind you.",
