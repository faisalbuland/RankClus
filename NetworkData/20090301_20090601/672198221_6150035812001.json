David Bossie, a former Republican congressional aide who produced the Clinton movie and another describing then-Sen. Barack Obama as an overhyped media darling, said his films are about important moments in American politics. \"The outcome of this case will dictate how we're able to make films and educate people about them,\" he said. At issue in the case being argued before justices Tuesday is the 90-minute anti-Clinton movie and television ads Bossie wanted to air during the 2008 primaries advertising the film. Bossie's group, the conservative Citizens United, released the movie as Clinton, then a New York senator, was competing with Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. The movie is unquestionably anti-Clinton, featuring commentary from conservative pundits, some of whom specifically say Clinton was not fit to be commander in chief. One scene, which was used in an ad, has Dick Morris, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton who is now a critic of the Clintons, saying the senator is \"the closest thing we have in America to a European socialist.\" The movie was shown in eight theaters. Bossie's group wanted run ads on television in key election states during peak primary season and show the movie on cable television's video-on-demand. Federal courts said the ads would violate the McCain-Feingold law, the popular name for 2002 revisions to the nation's campaign finance laws. Judges called \"Hillary: The Movie\" a 90-minute attack ad, rulings that would require Citizens United to identify the financial backers for the ads if they were to appear on television. And the 1st amendment has gone where?... Free speech, whether we agree with it or not, is one of our most cheerished freedoms... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I believe the question is \"false pretenses.\" These guys wanted to run ad's for the movie as a non-partisan documentary in the middle of a political campaign. In fact, this movie was simply a political attack ad but without the label.

In other words, they are not challenging the right to show the movie, but the right to show is as an unbiased documentary, when it's clearly a political ad. If this was a free speech question then the Court would be deciding if the movie can be shown at all - which clearly doesn't have anything to do with the case. Dave Uh, political speech, is free speech... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Quite right. No argument from me. Both the Left and the Right run ad's attacking the policies of their opponents. But we know who the source of the movie is. These people were running an ad WITHOUT identifying that it WAS an ad. I have no problem with their ad - My problem is with their label. Dave Agreed...

The justices' review of the slashing documentary financed by longtime critics of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton could bring more than just a thumbs up or thumbs down. It may settle the question of whether the government can regulate a politically charged film as a campaign ad.
