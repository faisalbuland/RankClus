President Mahinda Rajapaksa's Government has won China's financial, military and diplomatic support - along with the confidence to brush off Western protests. [SNIP] As well as diplomatic cover, China gave Sri Lanka $1.3 billion of aid last year. The air force was given six F7 jet fighters as a gift, and the army received $50 million of Chinese ordnance in 2007. What has Sri Lanka given in return? The answer is that China has acquired a strategic ally near the crucial Indian Ocean shipping lanes along which energy supplies from the Middle East are carried. Beijing is now building a port on Sri Lanka's southern coast that could serve as a naval base. **http://www.smh.com.au/world/military-emboldened-by-beijings-embrace-20090519-be7k.html** -",
