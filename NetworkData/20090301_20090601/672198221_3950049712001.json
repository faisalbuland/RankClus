Now a key adviser seems to agree with McCain. WASHINGTON -- One of President Obama's economic advisers said Sunday that the economy is fundamentally sound, a striking reversal from the Democrat's campaign rhetoric as his administration now guides the nation's financial health amid dire conditions. Obama's Democratic allies pleaded for patience for an administration hitting the two-month mark this week, while Republicans said the White House's plans ignore small business and the immediate need to fix what ails the economy. During the fall campaign, Obama mercilessly mocked his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain, for declaring, \"The fundamentals of our economy are strong.\" Obama's team painted the veteran senator as out of touch and failing to grasp the challenges facing the country. On Sunday, economic adviser Christina Romer was asked during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" if the fundamentals of the economy were sound. \"Of course they are sound,\" she replied. \"The fundamentals are sound in the sense that the American workers are sound, we have a good capital stock, we have good technology,\" she said. \"We know that -- that temporarily we're in a mess, right? We've seen huge job loss, we've seen very large falls in GDP. So certainly in the short run we're in a -- in a bad situation.\" Just a week ago, White House Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag declared that \"fundamentally, the economy is weak.\" The seesaw message from the new administration drew sharp criticism from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who said Obama's team was exploiting the economic situation for political gain. \"They're taking advantage of a crisis in order to do things that had nothing to do with getting us into the crisis in the first place,\" McConnell said. Gee, how many lambasted McCain for saying \"the fundamentals of our economy are strong\" ? I guess they all agree with him now.",
