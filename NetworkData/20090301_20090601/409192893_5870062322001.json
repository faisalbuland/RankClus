The saddest part is that why they are making cars for Americans, immediate feedback will be given to the manufacture streamlining their learning process. Very very soon their cars will become better in quality than our own because they will be able to afford it after we show them how. If they were to be left on their own they would focus on the cheap cars to come under costs. After we show/teach them that Americans want quality cars, then they will go that route. Paying what per man-hour will afford them to have a better car for less. The last obstacle has just been removed thanks to greed/political hacking",
