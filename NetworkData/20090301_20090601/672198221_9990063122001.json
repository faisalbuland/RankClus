We spent as much as a month outside the wire and when we came back to the rear, it was like landing on another planet. Out in the bush, we had what we carried on our backs or we had nothing. We might bathe in a creek once a week or so, but only if it wasn't too dangerous. I once went a month with a bath. In the rear, though, they had showers, mess halls, PX's and, in some cases, things like swimming pools and riding stables. They often wore starched fatigues and they all had shined boots. I'm not knocking the guys who worked there because they did important jobs and did them well, but they existed in a world which we found alien and in which we often were not welcome. For instance, a young LT once denied several of us the right to enter the Freedom Hill PX in Danang because we were dirty and stank. We'd literally come directly off the choppers which brought us back from a 2 week operation out in the Que Son Mountains. He just couldn't allow us to stink up his PX and the crowd of shined and polished REMF's passing by looked at us as if we had worms coming out of our heads. (which we may have! LOL) How could it be THAT different? Well, here's my answer: It was because the rear areas were where the old-time lifers were stationed. Too old and too much rank for combat, they were assigned desk jobs and were doing just what any old lifer would do: enforce discipline which, in the Army, means looking \"strack.\" Of course, we considered it fuggin' with us, but they didn't. I've heard of troops on the FOB's in Iraq getting Article 15's for being \"out of uniform,\" or even for walking side by side with someone not in the same uniform, and similar horror stories, but that's just the way it is in the rear with the gear. The more things change, the more they stay the same! (ps: When we were denied entry at the front door of the Freedom Hill PX, we went around to the back door, but that same LT met us there again. My friend \"Tiny\" didn't much care for his attitude and, with no warning, reached out and knocked him smooth out. We decided discretion might be the better part of valor at that moment and scurried back to our holes. )",

I would have done away with the numerous SUVs and only given one or two to the unit HQs (every MAJ and above does not need their own POV when the LPCs work just fine). We did get rocketed, but I never had any misconception that I was living anywhere near as tough as the folks out in the boonies.

Ya we had that to, but of course when the president flew in they wanted all of us around just in case. Set on a line for hours pulling guard and then once again we were to durty. But we won that on due to the fact that some full bird stepped in on our part and told the Capt where to go. Its nice to be appreciated by the REMP's once in a while.",
