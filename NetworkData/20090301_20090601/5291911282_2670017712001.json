YES, get a Lawyer and HAMMER this practice. There is some major unethical wool being pulled over somebody's eyes. Did the kid screw up? Yes. Do juveniles screw up because they don't see the big picture? Yes. Should this result in a permanent black mark on the record? No! \"Note what this means. It means that if an applicant failed to show up to ship out to basic training, the military COULD order the individual to active duty. If the individual refused, the military could legally court-martial the individual, if they wanted to. Now, let's talk reality. This never happens. Never. Not a single person has been involuntarily ordered to active duty, court-martialed, or otherwise prosecuted in civilian courts for being in the DEP and refusing to ship out to boot camp in *AT LEAST* the past 27 years. Not one single person.\" Did you \"refuse\" an order to report? Why not just report for duty, and the Army can work you through GED program - - Put the responsibility back on the military by saying, \"Here I am, ready to serve.
