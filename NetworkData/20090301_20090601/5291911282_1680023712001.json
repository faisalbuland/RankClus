I know NK has been a thorn in the world's side for a long time but they're growing stronger. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",

It's a good question, but a complex one. There are many variables, not the least of which include the UN and the resolutions that afford countries the right to apply deterrents in respect to its national defense stance. North Korea needs to be nuked off the face of the planet. They are useless except as a threat. What do they contribute to this planet and its inhabitants? Anyone? Bueler? Bueler? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. They are a threat to the security of others and nothing more. What gives a man a right to punish another man's child? Nothing, right? But that doesn't mean you wouldn't stop another man's child from beating the crap out another man's child, including physically restraining him or her. That's where we, the United States, are current at - we are standing in the way of a punk azz bully getting ready to pound on another child. If NK throws a punch, I hope we send a dozen nukes their way and wipe them off the face of the planet. Maybe then Iran will see that we're not kidding around, we're not sending our boys in to die, and we're not taking crap from pathetic little third-world useless wastes of oxygen. We are the baddest Mother F-ers on the block, and when we say 'knock it off,' we mean knock it off. Take your phallic symbol that is your little pea shooter of a missile and cram it up your azz, NK. Or we'll cram a few up there for you. F-ing terrorists. They deserve no rights, no freedoms, no acknowledgment. They are terrorists. They deserve nothing but death and to rot on the ground as the birds eat their eyes out and the maggots come to deliver the final blow and return to earth their wasted body parts.
