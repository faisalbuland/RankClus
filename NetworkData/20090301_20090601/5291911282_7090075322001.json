What was your best/worst trip. I'm sure if you have done any camping you have some good stories. We have been camping as a family for almost 30 years now. Started out in tent, graduated to a bigger tent, then to a small pop-up, then to a larger pop up. Next we moved up to a small travel trailer that had fold out front and back and now we have a 31 foot travel trailer with a slide-out. It let us take the family to some great places that we couldn't afford to go if we had to hotel-it, not to mention some great stories of the trials and tribulations of spending upto 2 weeks , putting up tents and breaking them down the next day to move on. We had a big 12x12 Eureka tent that we could put up in 5 minutes. Everyone had their assigned task in putting it up. Came in handy when you are doing in the rain , in the dark by the light of headlights. Don't miss those days but it is good for a laugh when we sit around reminecsing I have a lot of other stories but would like to here of others.",

Won't be camping with any little kids till my grandson (4 months) gets a little older. Actually we are going to the Walnut Valley festival in Winfield , Kansas in Sept and our daughter , son-in-law and grandson will be making the trip with us. Our daughter made her first camping trip when she was 6 months old. It was a bluegrass festival too. I have tons of pics but they have to be scanned too. As far as Ohiopyle , I was a scout leader and we took the troop up there. Seems like we were always just passing thru Pa, except we did go to Gettysburg a couple of times. I do like to hit the Civil War sights. Gettysburg is the crown jewel but have been to Manasas , Fort Donelon in Kentucky, and some others. Hope to swing down and see Shilo in Tenn in September",

Ya can't beat an RV, especially when a sudden rainstorm in the mountains hits, thats when tent camping tests your patience! The worst thing was having to take down a wet tent traveling for the day then having to put it back up that night. Not much fun with a pop-up either but better than a tent.",

Started out in tent, graduated to a bigger tent, then to a small pop-up, then to a larger pop up. Next we moved up to a small travel trailer that had fold out front and back and now we have a 31 foot travel trailer with a slide-out. It let us take the family to some great places that we couldn't afford to go if we had to hotel-it, not to mention some great stories of the trials and tribulations of spending upto 2 weeks , putting up tents and breaking them down the next day to move on. We had a big 12x12 Eureka tent that we could put up in 5 minutes. Everyone had their assigned task in putting it up. Came in handy when you are doing in the rain , in the dark by the light of headlights. Don't miss those days but it is good for a laugh when we sit around reminecsing I have a lot of other stories but would like to here of others.",

Won't be camping with any little kids till my grandson (4 months) gets a little older. Actually we are going to the Walnut Valley festival in Winfield , Kansas in Sept and our daughter , son-in-law and grandson will be making the trip with us. Our daughter made her first camping trip when she was 6 months old. It was a bluegrass festival too. I have tons of pics but they have to be scanned too. As far as Ohiopyle , I was a scout leader and we took the troop up there. Seems like we were always just passing thru Pa, except we did go to Gettysburg a couple of times. I do like to hit the Civil War sights. Gettysburg is the crown jewel but have been to Manasas , Fort Donelon in Kentucky, and some others. Hope to swing down and see Shilo in Tenn in September",
