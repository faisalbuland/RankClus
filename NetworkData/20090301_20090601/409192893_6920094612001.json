It's like beer: some people can drink it in large quantities all their lives and never become an alcoholic. They can stop or moderate their drinking whenever they like without any side effects. The same is true for some who use dope. Others, however, can't stop and suffer tremors or delirium's when they do. Those are addicts. The others aren't. The same is true for smokers, in spite of popular opinion. Its a brain altering addiction. Something like depression if the neurons are in short supply or being re absorbed faster than the body can produce them The firing order of the neurons are disrupted and to few will reach the happy receptors so its not possible to be happy unless the brain says so. Nicotine triggers neurons to hit pleasure receptors and anti smoking drugs mask those receptors from the nicotine. Or something along those lines. But thats the general Idea every thing starts and ends in the brain the conrol center.",

Because we want to and nothing like what's outlined in your post will overcome that. So there is no addiction? So what part draws you to smoke? Sure, there's an element of addiction, but it doesn't strike everyone the same way. Not all of us are true addictive personalities. In fact, I doubt most of us are. It's like beer: some people can drink it in large quantities all their lives and never become an alcoholic. They can stop or moderate their drinking whenever they like without any side effects. The same is true for some who use dope. Others, however, can't stop and suffer tremors or delirium's when they do. Those are addicts. The others aren't. The same is true for smokers, in spite of popular opinion.",

I don't know, but it's a distinct possibility, given that most of the studies about smoking and second hand smoke began with an assumption and then set out to prove it. How about we agree to donate our lungs to A. College (when our time on Earth is done) so they can be compared. Whatcha think?

Caffeine is addictive- the body becomes accustomed to it faster than any other substance. If you could not get through a day without your three Cokes, and/or continued to drink Coke despite a doctor's advice, teeth the color of a Hershey bar, etc. then you'd most likely be an addict. If you can quit a substance or activity when it negatively affects your life, then you're not an addict. Now, off to feed my borderline addiction to a truly habit-forming substance; my Girl Scout Cookies have arrived. P.S. Yes, I'm back- had lots of baby knitting and shopping to do. Still at it, but things have calmed down.",
