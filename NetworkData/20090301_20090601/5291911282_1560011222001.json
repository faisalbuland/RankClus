But if your recruiter's boss doesn't want to play, he doesn't want to play. Consider trying another service or another recruiter. Migraines are disqualifying. Headaches in general can be dangerous in a military career. Not even tolerated in air crew positions. I get headaches myself, and it was tough in the Army, but you can never let that kind of thing affect you while on duty. If you can't damper the headache with an over-the-counter pain-killer and still drive on through a twelve to fourteen hour workday, in the hot sun trying to qualify on weapons, or standing guard, or staring at a little computer display, or sitting in a smelly diesel truck - all without complaining - then you don't have any business joining up. And you should be able to make it through basic training without anything. And it can still be migraines, even if it's treatable by ibuprofen, it's really a doc's call. If you CAN manage headaches with over-the-counter meds, and hack a long sucky workday, then maybe trying for the waiver is worth it.",
