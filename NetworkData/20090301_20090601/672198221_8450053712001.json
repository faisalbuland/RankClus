But that\u2019s giving them too much credit. The craps analogy doesn\u2019t work because in dice, you have an actual chance of winning. What the Bills did is more like doubling down on 19 in blackjack when the dealer\u2019s showing 20. Unless you\u2019re the luckiest cuss alive, you\u2019re losing that bet, and everybody knows it. Somewhere in the Buffalo front office, people are saying, \u201cNothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d This is what people say when they buy lottery tickets, and it\u2019s true enough \u2014 if all you\u2019re risking is a dollar that you\u2019d just spend somewhere else. But when you or I buy a lottery ticket, we\u2019re not planning our future on the prospect of winning. The Bills are. The Bills paid $6.5 million for that chance. This isn\u2019t a 50-50 proposition. It\u2019s not 40-60 or 30-70. It\u2019s hard to say what the actual odds are, since Owens is batting a perfectly imperfect oh-for-3 with teams so far. No matter how well he\u2019s done on the field, he\u2019s always left a toxic slick behind him in the locker room. No team has been better off when he left than it was when he got there. There\u2019s a track record here that the Bills are ignoring, and it\u2019s going to come back to haunt them. They may as well lick their fingers and stick them in an electric socket. The effect is going to be the same. The Bills aren't renting T.O. in his prime. It\u2019s a 35-year-old wide out whose great skills are slowly declining. It\u2019s a guy who is incapable of being a team player. If Jerry Jones gave up on him, who in Buffalo can change him? \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
