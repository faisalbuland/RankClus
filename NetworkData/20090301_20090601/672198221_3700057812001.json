Once they start thinking on their own, they will realise how much he has lied and that he is NO different then any other politician in DC. He also needs to keep campaining to mask his real agenda. To create even more government to control all aspects of our lives. People complained about Bush killing the Constitution, yet those same folks think it's ok for Obama to do it because he ain't Bush. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?\" - Joseph Stalin",

Try pulling your head out of your hind end and actually posting something constructive. Thats by far the most weak and uneducated argument I have seen so far from his supporters time and time again when someone disagrees with his job performance and policies..",
