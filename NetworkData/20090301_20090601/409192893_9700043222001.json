These men still understood what scarifice meant, but the people pulled the rug from underneath them. There will be no draft as long as there is no need for it. You need to brush up on your history... The United States public took a position of Isolationism until December 7, 1941 when the US Navy was caught with their \"pants down\" in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii despite the known impeding threat of an attack from Japan once we cut off their oil supply. However, conveniently the attack resulted in the American public supporting a war... Not dissimilar to the attack on September 11, 2001. Can you explain to me why it was necessary to have a draft for the Vietnam war? Or why we fought in Vietnam to begin with?",
