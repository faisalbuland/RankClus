(....) \"Everything does not depend exclusively on Obama and Medvedev. Much depends on the respective elites in the two countries,\" says Yevgeny Volk, head of the Moscow branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation think-tank. \"It must be said that Russia has a significant amount of distrust for America. And the United States, for its part, also has a basis for not completely trusting Russia.\" That mistrust is still evident in the way the two sides view the war between Russia and neighboring Georgia in August 2008. The two presidents conceded in their statement that Moscow and Washington continue to disagree about the \"causes and sequence of the military actions\" in the five-day war. When Russian troops invaded Georgia after Tbilisi tried to recapture the pro-Moscow breakaway region of South Ossetia by force in August, it marked a post-Cold War nadir in Washington's relations with Moscow. The United States has forged close ties with Tbilisi and had been a strong advocate of Georgia joining NATO. Moscow, which sees the South Caucasus as its sphere of influence, has staunchly opposed this. A senior U.S. administration official said that in their meeting, Obama and Medvedev \"had real disagreements about Georgia.\" The official said that Obama made it clear to the Russian leader that Moscow's desire for a \"sphere of influence\" in the former Soviet Union was \"an idea whose time is long past.\" The two presidents also acknowledged that there were lingering differences over Washington's plans to build elements of a missile defense system in Central Europe. But they held out the possibility of future cooperation on the issue. Obama has shown less enthusiasm for the missile-defense proposal than his predecessor George W. Bush and has indicated to Medvedev that Washington would consider scrapping the idea if Moscow assisted in curbing Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Since coming to office in January, the Obama administration has stressed its desire to \"press the reset button\" with Russia and improve relations, which have steadily deteriorated in recent years. The Kremlin has made clear it expects Washington to initiate the effort by offering concessions. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs says, however, that restoring relations will take efforts from both sides. Gibbs told reporters this week that \"nobody believes that change in our relationship means giving everyone all they want... That's certainly not the intention of the president.\" Volk says that thawing relations between Moscow and Washington will be a \"long and difficult\" process, especially once it becomes apparent the hard trade-offs that each side will be forced to make in order to improve relations. \"If you take any international problem, there is more tension between Russia and the United States than there is common ground,\" Volk said. +http://www.rferl.org/content/Moscow_Washington_Try_To_Lead_By_Example_On_Arms_Control/1566069.html \"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\" -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
