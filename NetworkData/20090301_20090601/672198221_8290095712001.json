Rosa! Rejoin your formation!\" Steadied by a friend, he rose from his wheelchair and stepped onto the brown grass toward 200 uniformed soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team. Excited chattering came to a halt as heads turned and a knowing silence fell over the crowd. This audience knew what was happening. People were more than willing to forgo their reunions for a few minutes so one soldier could have his. Staff Sgt. Luis Rosa-Valentin was there to check on his guys. He lost two legs, part of his left arm, his hearing and some of his sight to an explosively formed projectile \u2013 a hardcore roadside bomb \u2013 but Luis wanted to see that his guys were OK and he came all the way from Maryland to make sure of it. They were some of his first concerns after coming out of a two-week-long coma, his wife, America, said. Luis wasn't worried about himself. His biggest worry was that the guys saw him get hurt and how that affected them. Luis was an infantry sergeant on a road patrol in Iraq on April 21, 2008, when a sniper opened fire. A bullet went through his legs and hit a buddy. Luis was on the lookout for snipers when he walked over a bomb 15 minutes later. Doctors replaced Luis' legs with titanium prosthetics and inserted a hearing aid and cochlear implant in his ears. He made significant progress and began therapy, but leaving the unit in Iraq was always at the back of his mind. Watching the soldiers come home was good for Luis because he won't have to worry about them as much and can focus on his therapy, said his best friend, Josh Hubbell. The two military brats have been best friends since high school. Josh was the one who helped Luis walk across the field and stood next to him in the formation. \"It was an honor,\" he said. \"Probably the biggest honor I've ever experienced in my life.\" Josh and America stood back as the soldiers were dismissed and a swarm of camouflage surrounded Luis. (...) Luis remained after the crowds cleared Tuesday, talking with three of the soldiers who sat on the grass in front of his wheelchair. One of them was the soldier who administered life-saving care soon after the bomb exploded. Someone brought America a folding chair and she sat and listened to the four soldiers exchange stories. It hasn't been easy, Luis admitted to them. He talked about dark times and he talked about God. He talked about the good times, too, laughing with his buddies as they remembered. Parked in the middle of the 4th Infantry's parade field, a burning cigarette in his remaining hand and tossing out an occasional cuss word, Staff Sgt. Luis Rosa-Valentin was where he wanted to be \u2013 with his guys....",
