You are creating a FALSE issue with this statement. Some better and more accurate arguements are: * As a nation we should NOT have cut taxes for the rich during a war and then try to pay for the war with borrowing. * We should not have attempted to fight a war while pretending that normal people didn't have to be affected. * Or even that we should have finished the REQUIRED war in Afganistan before starting the optional war in Iraq.",
