I might be wrong but I think hubby wants and needs some time totally away from the Army. You know, a place to kick back and just get used to being out of Iraq? Of course that's just my opinion.

        "content": "I believe it's best for young families to start out on base, for several reasons, but here are a couple: a. Economics: Your hubby's pay, etc., can go a lot further if it doesn't have to be spent on rent, utilities, and maintenance. With fewer things to eat up your funds, you'll be better able to budget, and put yourself in a position to save more. Also, consider care of your son while you're studying: On-post child care facilities will probably be cheaper for you than the off-base centers. b. Quality of life: You'll likely live in a much better cared-for and larger dwelling on base. Support facilities designed for military families will be more readily available. Going back to child care, the quality of the facility and staff will likely be higher, as they toe the line on guidelines, and your sonny might be cared for by another military mom, or at least a military spouse. You've already said yourself that you were struggling off-post. I think that being on-post would take a lot of pressure off both of you, what with your being in school, his readjustment, and your son's needs. After you finish school, he gets a couple more stripes, and you guys build up a sound financial foundation, you can move back out on the local economy and get along a lot easier. Stay on post for a while - that's my recommendation. Good luck to the three of you!",
