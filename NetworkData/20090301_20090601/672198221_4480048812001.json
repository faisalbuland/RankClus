        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A military pilot who ejected from a crippled fighter over a San Diego neighborhood \"screamed in horror\" when he saw the jet had crashed into a home, according to documents released Tuesday. Lt. Dan Neubauer described in a statement to investigators how he struggled to control the malfunctioning F/A-18D Hornet in the minutes before the Dec. 8 crash that killed four people on the ground and incinerated two homes. Neubauer's statement, cluttered with military jargon, nonetheless provides a dramatic look inside the cockpit of the ailing aircraft as he flew toward tragedy. \"I knew I had to get out. I pulled the nose up a little bit and then reached down between my legs for the ejection handle,\" Neubauer wrote. \"The canopy blew and then after what seemed like an eternity I was ejected,\" the statement said. Dangling below his parachute, he looked down to trace the jet's plunge. \"It had gone right into a house. I screamed in horror when I realized what had just happened,\" Neubauer wrote. \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,510415,00.html\" Photos available at above link also. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
