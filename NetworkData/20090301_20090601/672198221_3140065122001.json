Judy Foster of the London Humane Society says one of the American alligators measures nearly two metres in length, while the other is a little more than 50 centimetres long. (...) The humane society is not to equipped to remove or house alligators, so an expert was called in from southern Ontario to handle the delicate job, Foster said. The alligators, along with a monitor lizard, an iguana and a tortoise, were all removed from the home after a veterinarian determined the animals were in distress. (...) London police also located a small amount of marijuana and a martial-arts weapon known as nunchuks in the home. Raymond Scott, 39, and Irving Stelmacovitch, 34, both of London, Ont., are charged with possession of marijuana and possession of a prohibited weapon. Charges have not yet been laid in relation to the animals.",
