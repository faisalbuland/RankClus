This was from a Jan,19/09 article: >http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news/4125 \"M\u00e9rida, January 19th, 2009 (Venezuelanalysis.com)-- In statements to the press over the weekend, the president-elect of the United States, Barack Obama, and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez intensified their critiques of each other while reiterating their mutual desire to improve relations, leaving much uncertainty as to how diplomatic relations will take shape following Obama\u2019s inauguration as the 44th president of the U.S. Tuesday. In the wake of widely-circulated news about meetings between opposition leaders and U.S. State Department officials in Puerto Rico last week, Ch\u00e1vez expressed skepticism toward the incoming Obama administration, demanding actions that show that the U.S. will put a halt to its long history of interventions in the affairs of its southern neighbors.\" Chavez then said, \"I demand of the new president of the United States that he does not mess with Venezuela, because Venezuela is a free and sovereign country,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez, whose administration has purchased the majority share of all oil production in Venezuela and who strongly denounces U.S. government funding for domestic opposition groups.\" President Obama then said,\"Venezuela is a country of critical importance to commerce in the region, it is an important provider of petroleum. We are willing to begin diplomatic conversations about how to improve relations,\u201d said Obama. He added that \u201call countries in the region of have something of importance to contribute.\u201d The article goes on to state that Obama will meet with Cuba if President Raul Castro is willing to give Cubans more personal freedom. As we speak major American telecommunications companies are jumping all over the new attitude out of Washington. Castro has said he's willing to talk and \"everything is on the table\". Obama called Chavez \"a force that has impeded progress in the region.\u201d Ch\u00e1vez responded in kind Monday, calling the U.S. the world\u2019s top exporter of terrorism. He harshly criticized Obama\u2019s silence about the bloody invasion of Gaza by Israel, the U.S.\u2019s principal ally in the Middle East. \u201cYou ask [Obama] his opinion about the massacre of innocent children in Palestine, and he does not respond,\u201d Ch\u00e1vez said. If under Obama\u2019s administration the U.S.\u2019s wars and interventions in foreign states continue as they have under the Bush administration, said Ch\u00e1vez, this will be \u201ca new fiasco for his own people and for the world.\u201d They weren't buddy-pal then. But Obama has said way up front that \"Our responsibility as Americans is not to dictate policies\u2026 but to find cooperation and mutual interest.\u201d That's what he seems to be doing and since most Americans heard that and made him the President, I figure this is what most Americans want too. If he can figure out a way to deal with Chavez in that vein, I say right on. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Thud357L, Sat 18 April 2009 05:20 PM",

In the wake of widely-circulated news about meetings between opposition leaders and U.S. State Department officials in Puerto Rico last week, Ch\u00e1vez expressed skepticism toward the incoming Obama administration, demanding actions that show that the U.S. will put a halt to its long history of interventions in the affairs of its southern neighbors.\" Chavez then said, \"I demand of the new president of the United States that he does not mess with Venezuela, because Venezuela is a free and sovereign country,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez, whose administration has purchased the majority share of all oil production in Venezuela and who strongly denounces U.S. government funding for domestic opposition groups.\" President Obama then said,\"Venezuela is a country of critical importance to commerce in the region, it is an important provider of petroleum. We are willing to begin diplomatic conversations about how to improve relations,\u201d said Obama. He added that \u201call countries in the region of have something of importance to contribute.\u201d The article goes on to state that Obama will meet with Cuba if President Raul Castro is willing to give Cubans more personal freedom. As we speak major American telecommunications companies are jumping all over the new attitude out of Washington. Castro has said he's willing to talk and \"everything is on the table\". Obama called Chavez \"a force that has impeded progress in the region.\u201d Ch\u00e1vez responded in kind Monday, calling the U.S. the world\u2019s top exporter of terrorism. He harshly criticized Obama\u2019s silence about the bloody invasion of Gaza by Israel, the U.S.\u2019s principal ally in the Middle East. \u201cYou ask [Obama] his opinion about the massacre of innocent children in Palestine, and he does not respond,\u201d Ch\u00e1vez said. If under Obama\u2019s administration the U.S.\u2019s wars and interventions in foreign states continue as they have under the Bush administration, said Ch\u00e1vez, this will be \u201ca new fiasco for his own people and for the world.\u201d They weren't buddy-pal then. But Obama has said way up front that \"Our responsibility as Americans is not to dictate policies\u2026 but to find cooperation and mutual interest.\u201d That's what he seems to be doing and since most Americans heard that and made him the President, I figure this is what most Americans want too.
