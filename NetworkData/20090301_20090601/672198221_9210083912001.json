The article says this: (Quote)The United States can do nothing to stop North Korea from breaking international law in the next 10 days by firing a missile that is unlikely to be shot down by the U.S. or its allies, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday. He didn't say that we couldn't shoot the dam thing down. However, I believe I heard in passing that we wouldn't shoot it down? (Quote)Makes no since!(Quote) BTW, it's spelled 'sense'!",

You are correct. Gates already said last week he did not nor would he shot it down. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns.
