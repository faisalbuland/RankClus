The $400-500 million contract for the delivery of eight MiG-31s was inked in early 2007, the paper said. But work on the modernization of the planes at the Sokol aviation plant in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod halted last month, Kommersant quoted sources at the plant as saying. A spokesman for Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport, Vyacheslav Davidenko, declined to comment on the report May 20, dismissing it as \"rumors.\" A source close to the arms exporter told Kommersant the contract had been frozen under pressure from Israel as the weapon sales could offset the balance of power in the region.
