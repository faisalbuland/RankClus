The \"leaders\" of the Republican Party can not and will not win in the next election. Why? Because when the media and the democrats get through with them they won't be anything but a joke in obamanation's eyes. What the Republican Party needs is new blood to lead the party into the future and I hope that these new leaders aren't in place for another six years. Why? Because by the time the democrats have control over this country for the next six years the American people will be begging for more \"hope\" and \"change\". All I wonder is if when a country goes \"bankrupt\", does it take seven years for it to restore it's ranking again?",
