The statement was the latest hint Iran could be backing off from the imprisonment of 31-year-old Roxana Saberi on charges of spying for the U.S. On Monday, the judiciary chief ordered a full investigation into the case, a day after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged Tehran's chief prosecutor to ensure Saberi be allowed a full defense during her appeal. The case has been a source of tension with the U.S. at a time when President Barack Obama is trying to open a dialogue with Iran to end a decades-long diplomatic standoff. The U.S. has called the accusations against Saberi, a dual American-Iranian citizen, baseless and demanded her release. \"We can't influence the judge's verdict (but hope) the verdict will be reconsidered at the appeals court,\" the official IRNA news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Ali Reza Jamshidi as saying. The statement was seen as a rare prediction from the judiciary about a pending case. In Washington, State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the U.S. wanted to see \"a transparent appeals process.\" \"We are working with our allies to press the government in Tehran to disclose fully the charges against Ms. Saberi and ensure that she is being treated properly,\" said Wood.
