But I suspect they will make you a \"Tag-a-long\" with an old hand in the business to learn the ropes.. kinda like an apprentice, and he'll either share the commissions or give them to you. Most likely you will be given a monthly salary but it will not be enought to make ends meet... the reason is you are supposed to sell houses to make the big bucks... And why would you come to this place to ask questions? Now, GWG.... any odds if this person comes back? One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

You have to decide whether you want to be an active real estate agent, or a referral agent or be an inactive agent. There are courses you can take to learn how to be a real estate referral agent, and some sites offer commissions to members who give referrals. In the current scenario, it is best that you join a referral service like contact me thru my profile. This message has been edited. Last edited by: mainedawg, Sat 04 April 2009 02:41 AM",
