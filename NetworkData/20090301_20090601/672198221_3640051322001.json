Yes but, was he sane at the time of commission of the act of murder?... That will be the determining factor and that he was ordered to attend the class at all, is an indicator that someone, somewhere, thought that he needed it... One wonders... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 sounds like it just snap to much to fast. more fact shall be comeing out soon.",

There are hundreds of thousands who have handled the stress of multiple combat tours and those who have lost it in their first few weeks in the Green Zone.
