Right now, Uncle Sam is responsible for that. If Obabma has his way, we will be. Basically what he wants to do is to force your civilian insurance to pay for your service connected injuries- that is if you have insurance. Good luck getting a job if you have service connected disabilities. Employers probably wont hire you cuz now their insurance premiums will go through the roof. It is bad enough that we have to put up with the ridiculous care from the military/gov't- now to add insult to injury they want us to pay for it? Read the article: http://www.vfw.org/index.cfm?fa=news.newsDtl&did=4961 Is it just me or is Obama out of his mind? Chains you can believe in.",

You can put this in the same column as HR45 which is the first step in confiscation of firearms from all U.S. citizens (except the criminals) which virtually copies directly the edicts issued by Lenin after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia leading to the total confiscation of all privately owned firearms and under Stalin mass arrests, imprisonment, and execution for the crime against the state in having once owned a firearm. If this bill is news to you please look it up. Thomas Jefferson was right on concerning private ownership of firearms, \" With the right to private ownership of firearms you are a citizen, and without the right to private ownership of firearms you are a subject\" and \"This (the 2nd Amendment) is not intended to protect the citizenry from foreign invaders, it is to protect the citizenry from its government\" Go back to Obama's campaign speechs in which he stated clearly what he planned to do to the US Military forces i.e. unilateral nuclear disarmament, stop development of all strategic and conventional weapons, slash the military funding by up to 50% within his \"first\" term, standdown and decommission our \"Boomers\" and land based missiles, cut back the \"unnecessary entitlement\" programs supporting military retirees and eventually delete them.

I was there before it became a popular tour area, in fact when the real bad guys were there. It broke the Soviet forces and it will break ours. It is an unwinnable conventional war and Obama knows it. We proved an organized guerilla force can defeat conventional forces at will. The only method of warfare that will produce a \"victory\" in Afghanistan (which has absolutely no strategic value to us whereas it did for the Soviets who wanted a warm water port)is a sustained ruthless campaign by small hunter killer units operating without restrictions of any kind. We have the special forces and the expertise but do not have the conviction to do what needs to be done. Obama plans to break our force structure, demoralize the troops, kill recruitment for the US All Volunteer \"Mercenary\" Army on the cheap, and undermine the \"real leadership\" field grade officer corps and middle and senior NCO corps.
