The harrassment of the last administration and his Father before him calling them Nazi, out of touch, it's the economy stupid, traitors, still ring in my deaf ears, and still even with them gone, it's more of the same thing that fuels your motor. \"I can't deny that it will be a historic event when an African-American becomes president,\" Powell continued, speaking live in the studio. \"And should that happen, all Americans should be proud \u2014 not just African-American, but all Americans \u2014 that we have reached this point in our national history where such a thing could happen. It would also not only electrify the country, but electrify the world.\" If the proper job is done I would be proud if he were Chinese. To bring you up to speed. It was a Bush that named Powell Joint Chief of Staff and his immediately boss with Cheney DOD, Sam Nunn Chairman of the Armed Service committee, all three doing a slide shows on the 90' war. Cheney and Nunn are traceable to the family tree. I was kidded that Powell was also a cousin. I don't think he owes the party anything but an arm and a leg. Remember who named him to Secretary of State? With loyalty like this he needs to join Specter and Benedict Arnold. This just shows without Bush, Bush and Cheney he would have retired without a book tour and nobody would give a damn who he endorsed. I take exception to the accusation to make points.",

No offense Ray, but personally I think the idea that Powel endorsed Obama cause he's a \"brother,\" is a cheap shot. A lot of Republicans endorsed Obama in this election. I don't think you would make that statement about all those others. And there WERE Democrats who endorsed McCain.
