Seems much heavier now . \"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/apr/24/pakistan-swat-valley-taliban Pakistan's Swat dream turns into a nightmareThe Taliban has failed to keep its side of the bargain in the Swat Valley \u2013 and Pakistan is facing criticism at home and abroad Comments It seemed like a good idea at the time. Rather than endlessly engage in inconclusive, on-off guerrilla warfare with Taliban insurgents, Pakistan's security forces cut a deal. The Islamists would have de facto local administrative control, including implementation of sharia law. In return, they would accept federal government authority, stop fighting, and lay down their arms. But February's deal in Swat has brought nothing but trouble, as its many domestic and foreign critics predicted. Tales of Taliban outrages against local people, including summary executions and the flogging of women for un-Islamist behaviour, gave the lie to claims that Swat's 1.5 million residents supported the militants' takeover. It quickly became clear that Taliban leaders would not keep their side of the bargain. No arms were decommissioned; instead local police and judges were hounded out. Speaking from Swat in a nationally televised address last week, Maulana Sufi Muhammad, a senior cleric, said the aim was to create a \"complete Islamic system\" for the north-west region and ultimately, the entire country. Specifically, Sufi Muhammad said appeals from sharia courts to state courts would not be allowed, despite earlier undertakings. \"All un-Islamic laws and customs will be abolished,\" he said, making it plain that he and other radicals such as the recently freed Maulana Abdul Aziz regarded Pakistan's western-style democratic constitution as illegitimate. \"The Qur'an says supporting an infidel system is a great sin.\" Taliban fighters are now increasingly using Swat as a base from which to extend their control, moving in force into Buner and Shangla districts and deploying ever closer to the capital, Islamabad. Paramilitary troops sent to Buner were repulsed with casualties this week. A Taliban withdrawal, announced today, is likely to be both tactical and temporary. Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, and his ministers now face a growing storm of criticism over an alleged abdication of leadership in North-West Frontier province and neighbouring Fata, the federally administered tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. But they continue to defend the Swat deal, arguing it may yet work, that it was their only viable option, and that it is similar to local alliances forged by the US in Afghanistan and Iraq. Maleeha Lodhi, a former senior Pakistan diplomat in London and Washington, said the pact was a disaster in both local security and human rights terms. But its wider ramifications were more troubling still. \"First and foremost it represents a retreat from Jinnah's Pakistan,\" she said in a recent commentary, referring to the country's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. \"It is the very antithesis of [his] visions and ideals, the core of which were a modern, unified Muslim state, not one fragmented along obscurantist and sectarian lines.\" Lodhi said the deal betrayed the people of Swat and could mark a turning point in Pakistan's struggle against extremism. \"Rattled by more aggressive actions by militants, the political and security establishments caved in to the challenge ... The deal signalled weakness and bankruptcy on the part of the ruling elite that [has] chosen appeasement.\" Some analysts suggest the government is biding its time, waiting for the Islamists to over-reach \u2013 and that when it is plain to the public that they cannot be trusted or reasoned with, Islamabad will send the army to crush them. But others detect a lack of political will, a deep-set ambiguity about confronting groups that have served Pakistan's purposes in the past in Afghanistan and Kashmir, and also, perhaps, a failure of nerve. An increasingly harsh view is being taken in Washington, where Richard Holbrooke, Barack Obama's special representative, admitted this week that more attention was now focused on Pakistan than on the war in Afghanistan. Secretary of state Hillary Clinton, defence secretary Robert Gates, and the White House have all urged Zardari to get tough. US officials worry further that the militants' influence is spreading into the heartlands of Punjab, and that the Pashtun Taliban and their Arab jihadi associates are forming alliances with Punjabi extremists, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, implicated in the attack on Sri Lanka's cricketers in Lahore in March. But the biggest western worry is that fracturing political authority and rising militancy in Pakistan will fatally undermine the linked war against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Anger at US policy in general and at US aerial raids into north-western Pakistan, and potentially into Baluchistan in the south, have contributed mightily to this spreading, shared instability. Now the Swat debacle is bringing the nightmare of an escalating, widening, simultaneous two-country war steadily closer. For the US, Britain and their allies, the looming spectre is not one failed state but two\"",
