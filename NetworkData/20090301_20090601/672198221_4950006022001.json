And what might that \"myth\" be? That Obama is a weak leader? That he is incapable of decisive action? What? The world wonders... As it is, President Obama made the correct decision and should be commended. But then, this is what we expect from the Cinc. And a Bravo Zulu to the United States Navy! Just as Joe Biden predicted in the campaign that he would be tested early, and conservatives went wild in criticizing him saying it, and the new CinC passed his first test with flying colors. Not much of a prediction. This happens all the time. Look back at JFK and Khruschev. However, a much larger test of the Presedent is comming from Korea. But once again the President deserves a pat on the back. And who might those \"conservatives\" be? How about a couple links to reliable news sources?",
