IBM has been reporting record profits the last several quarters. They are continually laying off American workers and sending the jobs over seas. This you all know however, this is not for equally skilled labor. The wages are lower though the ones of us who remain here in America working for the company are having to go back and fix the continual mistakes in the work being done else where. As an example a division within the department I work for provides imaging and packagin services for IBM global. Where in the past we could have an image built or an application packaged for deployment within a very short amount of time (usually same day possibly a few days depending on complexity) the work being preformed in Argentina is taking several weeks and multiple employees to do the job that a single individual in my department would have had the work done. Once the Argentina group is \"finished\" they send it back to us to verify and once again we have to send it back for corrections. That is one of many more examples. This is occuring in all departments of Information Technology and accounting. IBM is not interested in creating American jobs. Even the CEO has before commented that IBM is not an American company but a global company. There are many more places the company could trim the fat and still not eliminate American jobs. Many of those would be in simply reworking some of their internaly redundant processes that waste a vast majority of time. On another note. Though I have not been told the specific number of the 5000 employees that have been laid off I do know that our facility has 70+ workers who have been laid off. All of them at my facility are over the age of 50. most very near their retirement. Some are being allowed to take early retirement. Some are being given severence packages. Many are not getting anything. A few months ago (within the last 4) IBM converted approximatly 1600 workers (Again almost 300 were in my facilty) from IBM employees to contractors. Then gave them their notice as to when they will be unemployed and the majority lost any severance they would have gotten because they are no longer employees but are now contractors. Either way you look at it, though IBM may not be doing anything technicaly illegal, they are however hurting the American work force. In my humble opinion they are also showing themselves to be very anti American. (that is just my opinion though) Hopefully those who have been laid off will find something soon and those of us still there.... well lets hope we find something soon too.",

IBM has been reporting record profits the last several quarters. They are continually laying off American workers and sending the jobs over seas. This you all know however, this is not for equally skilled labor. The wages are lower though the ones of us who remain here in America working for the company are having to go back and fix the continual mistakes in the work being done else where. As an example a division within the department I work for provides imaging and packagin services for IBM global. Where in the past we could have an image built or an application packaged for deployment within a very short amount of time (usually same day possibly a few days depending on complexity) the work being preformed in Argentina is taking several weeks and multiple employees to do the job that a single individual in my department would have had the work done. Once the Argentina group is \"finished\" they send it back to us to verify and once again we have to send it back for corrections. That is one of many more examples. This is occuring in all departments of Information Technology and accounting. IBM is not interested in creating American jobs. Even the CEO has before commented that IBM is not an American company but a global company. There are many more places the company could trim the fat and still not eliminate American jobs. Many of those would be in simply reworking some of their internaly redundant processes that waste a vast majority of time. On another note. Though I have not been told the specific number of the 5000 employees that have been laid off I do know that our facility has 70+ workers who have been laid off. All of them at my facility are over the age of 50. most very near their retirement. Some are being allowed to take early retirement. Some are being given severence packages. Many are not getting anything. A few months ago (within the last 4) IBM converted approximatly 1600 workers (Again almost 300 were in my facilty) from IBM employees to contractors. Then gave them their notice as to when they will be unemployed and the majority lost any severance they would have gotten because they are no longer employees but are now contractors. Either way you look at it, though IBM may not be doing anything technicaly illegal, they are however hurting the American work force. In my humble opinion they are also showing themselves to be very anti American. (that is just my opinion though) Hopefully those who have been laid off will find something soon and those of us still there.... well lets hope we find something soon too.",

I was watching the President's Town Hall meeting and while he was answering the question about outsourcing of jobs, the news crawler was reporting the IBM plan. Yeh, he said they were low paying low skilled jobs. Ehhh wrong answer, the were skilled jobs. IBM is sounds and made around 4bil last yr. I knew many years ago that it was just a matter of time before the normal blue collar jobs leaving the white colar jobs would follow. Not rocket science. The white collars that supported getting rid of the blue collars are now fighting for thier jobs themselves and they brought it all on.",

It will get worse, congress primarily the donkey side wants to punish business with higher taxes. They will leave in droves. Somewhat true, but lowering the taxes a TAD would do nothing but feed this myth. Companies chase savings, saving means lower labor rates as well. Now if we had the fair tax (yes I am pushing it again dave) and there was no business tax, compared to any taxes companies paid in other countries they would stay here and still probably pay as low wages as possible, unless there was a demand for a particular job. I would rather have a job than no job, even if that means the rich make out but they always make out any way.",
