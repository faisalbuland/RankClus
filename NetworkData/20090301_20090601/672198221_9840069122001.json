But his assurance Tuesday night that only the deserving will get help rang hollow. Even officials in his administration, many supporters of the plan in Congress and the Federal Reserve chairman expect some of that money will go to people who used lousy judgment. The president skipped over several complex economic circumstances in his speech to Congress - and may have started an international debate among trivia lovers and auto buffs over what country invented the car. A look at some of his assertions: OBAMA: \u201cWe have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It\u2019s a plan that won\u2019t help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values.\u201d THE FACTS: If the administration has come up with a way to ensure money only goes to those who got in honest trouble, it hasn\u2019t said so. Defending the program Tuesday at a Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said it\u2019s important to save those who made bad calls, for the greater good. He likened it to calling the fire department to put out a blaze caused by someone smoking in bed. \u201cI think the smart way to deal with a situation like that is to put out the fire, save him from his own consequences of his own action but then, going forward, enact penalties and set tougher rules about smoking in bed.\u201d Similarly, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested this month it\u2019s not likely aid will be denied to all homeowners who overstated their income or assets to get a mortgage they couldn\u2019t afford. \u201cI think it\u2019s just simply impractical to try to do a forensic analysis of each and every one of these delinquent loans,\u201d Sheila Bair told National Public Radio. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cAnd I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\u201d THE FACTS: Depends what your definition of automobiles, is. According to the Library of Congress, the inventor of the first true automobile was probably Germany\u2019s Karl Benz, who created the first auto powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine, in 1885 or 1886. In the U.S., Charles Duryea tested what library researchers called the first successful gas-powered car in 1893. Nobody disputes that Henry Ford created the first assembly line that made cars affordable. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cWe have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before.\u201d THE FACTS: Oil imports peaked in 2005 at just over 5 billion barrels, and have been declining slightly since. The figure in 2007 was 4.9 billion barrels, or about 58 percent of total consumption. The nation is on pace this year to import 4.7 billion barrels, and government projections are for imports to hold steady or decrease a bit over the next two decades. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cWe have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade.\u201d THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don\u2019t mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won\u2019t be 10 years from now. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cRegulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn\u2019t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.\u201d THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn\u2019t only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cIn this budget, we will end education programs that don\u2019t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don\u2019t need them. We\u2019ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we\u2019re not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don\u2019t use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn\u2019t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.\u201d THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That\u2019s all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama\u2019s proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress. Second, waste, fraud and abuse are routinely targeted by presidents who later find that the savings realized seldom amount to significant sums. Programs that a president might consider wasteful have staunch defenders in Congress who have fought off similar efforts in the past. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cThanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation\u2019s supply of renewable energy in the next three years.\u201d THE FACTS: While the president\u2019s stimulus package includes billions in aid for renewable energy and conservation, his goal is unlikely to be achieved through the recovery plan alone. In 2007, the U.S. produced 8.4 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, including hydroelectric dams, solar panels and windmills. Under the status quo, the Energy Department says, it will take more than two decades to boost that figure to 12.5 percent. If Obama is to achieve his much more ambitious goal, Congress would need to mandate it. That is the thrust of an energy bill that is expected to be introduced in coming weeks. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cOver the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.\u201d THE FACTS: This is a recurrent Obama formulation. But job creation projections are uncertain even in stable times, and some of the economists relied on by Obama in making his forecast acknowledge a great deal of uncertainty in their numbers. The president\u2019s own economists, in a report prepared last month, stated, \u201cIt should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error.\u201d Beyond that, it\u2019s unlikely the nation will ever know how many jobs are saved as a result of the stimulus. While it\u2019s clear when jobs are abolished, there\u2019s no economic gauge that tracks job preservation. The estimates are based on economic assumptions of how many jobs would be lost without the stimulus. Senator Byrd: Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the longest-serving Democratic senator, is criticizing President Obama\u2019s appointment of White House \u201cczars\u201d to oversee federal policy, saying these executive positions amount to a power grab by the executive branch. In a letter to Obama on Wednesday, Byrd complained about Obama\u2019s decision to create White House offices on health reform, urban affairs policy, and energy and climate change. Byrd said such positions \u201ccan threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\u201d While it\u2019s rare for Byrd to criticize a president in his own party, Byrd is a stern constitutional scholar who has always stood up for the legislative branch in its role in checking the power of the White House. Byrd no longer holds the powerful Appropriations chairmanship, so his criticism does not carry as much weight these days. Byrd repeatedly clashed with the Bush administration over executive power, and it appears that he\u2019s not limiting his criticism to Republican administrations. Byrd also wants Obama to limit claims of executive privilege while also ensuring that the White House czars don\u2019t have authority over Cabinet officers confirmed by the Senate.",

But his assurance Tuesday night that only the deserving will get help rang hollow. Even officials in his administration, many supporters of the plan in Congress and the Federal Reserve chairman expect some of that money will go to people who used lousy judgment. The president skipped over several complex economic circumstances in his speech to Congress - and may have started an international debate among trivia lovers and auto buffs over what country invented the car. A look at some of his assertions: OBAMA: \u201cWe have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It\u2019s a plan that won\u2019t help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values.\u201d THE FACTS: If the administration has come up with a way to ensure money only goes to those who got in honest trouble, it hasn\u2019t said so. Defending the program Tuesday at a Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said it\u2019s important to save those who made bad calls, for the greater good. He likened it to calling the fire department to put out a blaze caused by someone smoking in bed. \u201cI think the smart way to deal with a situation like that is to put out the fire, save him from his own consequences of his own action but then, going forward, enact penalties and set tougher rules about smoking in bed.\u201d Similarly, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested this month it\u2019s not likely aid will be denied to all homeowners who overstated their income or assets to get a mortgage they couldn\u2019t afford. \u201cI think it\u2019s just simply impractical to try to do a forensic analysis of each and every one of these delinquent loans,\u201d Sheila Bair told National Public Radio. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cAnd I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\u201d THE FACTS: Depends what your definition of automobiles, is. According to the Library of Congress, the inventor of the first true automobile was probably Germany\u2019s Karl Benz, who created the first auto powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine, in 1885 or 1886. In the U.S., Charles Duryea tested what library researchers called the first successful gas-powered car in 1893. Nobody disputes that Henry Ford created the first assembly line that made cars affordable. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cWe have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before.\u201d THE FACTS: Oil imports peaked in 2005 at just over 5 billion barrels, and have been declining slightly since. The figure in 2007 was 4.9 billion barrels, or about 58 percent of total consumption. The nation is on pace this year to import 4.7 billion barrels, and government projections are for imports to hold steady or decrease a bit over the next two decades. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cWe have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade.\u201d THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don\u2019t mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won\u2019t be 10 years from now. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cRegulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn\u2019t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.\u201d THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn\u2019t only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cIn this budget, we will end education programs that don\u2019t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don\u2019t need them. We\u2019ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we\u2019re not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don\u2019t use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn\u2019t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.\u201d THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That\u2019s all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama\u2019s proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress. Second, waste, fraud and abuse are routinely targeted by presidents who later find that the savings realized seldom amount to significant sums. Programs that a president might consider wasteful have staunch defenders in Congress who have fought off similar efforts in the past. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cThanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation\u2019s supply of renewable energy in the next three years.\u201d THE FACTS: While the president\u2019s stimulus package includes billions in aid for renewable energy and conservation, his goal is unlikely to be achieved through the recovery plan alone. In 2007, the U.S. produced 8.4 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, including hydroelectric dams, solar panels and windmills. Under the status quo, the Energy Department says, it will take more than two decades to boost that figure to 12.5 percent. If Obama is to achieve his much more ambitious goal, Congress would need to mandate it. That is the thrust of an energy bill that is expected to be introduced in coming weeks. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cOver the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.\u201d THE FACTS: This is a recurrent Obama formulation. But job creation projections are uncertain even in stable times, and some of the economists relied on by Obama in making his forecast acknowledge a great deal of uncertainty in their numbers. The president\u2019s own economists, in a report prepared last month, stated, \u201cIt should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error.\u201d Beyond that, it\u2019s unlikely the nation will ever know how many jobs are saved as a result of the stimulus. While it\u2019s clear when jobs are abolished, there\u2019s no economic gauge that tracks job preservation. The estimates are based on economic assumptions of how many jobs would be lost without the stimulus. Senator Byrd: Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the longest-serving Democratic senator, is criticizing President Obama\u2019s appointment of White House \u201cczars\u201d to oversee federal policy, saying these executive positions amount to a power grab by the executive branch. In a letter to Obama on Wednesday, Byrd complained about Obama\u2019s decision to create White House offices on health reform, urban affairs policy, and energy and climate change. Byrd said such positions \u201ccan threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\u201d While it\u2019s rare for Byrd to criticize a president in his own party, Byrd is a stern constitutional scholar who has always stood up for the legislative branch in its role in checking the power of the White House. Byrd no longer holds the powerful Appropriations chairmanship, so his criticism does not carry as much weight these days. Byrd repeatedly clashed with the Bush administration over executive power, and it appears that he\u2019s not limiting his criticism to Republican administrations. Byrd also wants Obama to limit claims of executive privilege while also ensuring that the White House czars don\u2019t have authority over Cabinet officers confirmed by the Senate.",

Yet we import more oil today than ever before.\u201d THE FACTS: Oil imports peaked in 2005 at just over 5 billion barrels, and have been declining slightly since. The figure in 2007 was 4.9 billion barrels, or about 58 percent of total consumption. The nation is on pace this year to import 4.7 billion barrels, and government projections are for imports to hold steady or decrease a bit over the next two decades. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cWe have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade.\u201d THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don\u2019t mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won\u2019t be 10 years from now. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cRegulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn\u2019t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.\u201d THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn\u2019t only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cIn this budget, we will end education programs that don\u2019t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don\u2019t need them. We\u2019ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we\u2019re not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don\u2019t use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn\u2019t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.\u201d THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That\u2019s all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama\u2019s proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress. Second, waste, fraud and abuse are routinely targeted by presidents who later find that the savings realized seldom amount to significant sums. Programs that a president might consider wasteful have staunch defenders in Congress who have fought off similar efforts in the past. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cThanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation\u2019s supply of renewable energy in the next three years.\u201d THE FACTS: While the president\u2019s stimulus package includes billions in aid for renewable energy and conservation, his goal is unlikely to be achieved through the recovery plan alone. In 2007, the U.S. produced 8.4 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, including hydroelectric dams, solar panels and windmills. Under the status quo, the Energy Department says, it will take more than two decades to boost that figure to 12.5 percent. If Obama is to achieve his much more ambitious goal, Congress would need to mandate it. That is the thrust of an energy bill that is expected to be introduced in coming weeks. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cOver the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.\u201d THE FACTS: This is a recurrent Obama formulation. But job creation projections are uncertain even in stable times, and some of the economists relied on by Obama in making his forecast acknowledge a great deal of uncertainty in their numbers. The president\u2019s own economists, in a report prepared last month, stated, \u201cIt should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error.\u201d Beyond that, it\u2019s unlikely the nation will ever know how many jobs are saved as a result of the stimulus. While it\u2019s clear when jobs are abolished, there\u2019s no economic gauge that tracks job preservation. The estimates are based on economic assumptions of how many jobs would be lost without the stimulus. Senator Byrd: Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the longest-serving Democratic senator, is criticizing President Obama\u2019s appointment of White House \u201cczars\u201d to oversee federal policy, saying these executive positions amount to a power grab by the executive branch. In a letter to Obama on Wednesday, Byrd complained about Obama\u2019s decision to create White House offices on health reform, urban affairs policy, and energy and climate change. Byrd said such positions \u201ccan threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\u201d While it\u2019s rare for Byrd to criticize a president in his own party, Byrd is a stern constitutional scholar who has always stood up for the legislative branch in its role in checking the power of the White House. Byrd no longer holds the powerful Appropriations chairmanship, so his criticism does not carry as much weight these days. Byrd repeatedly clashed with the Bush administration over executive power, and it appears that he\u2019s not limiting his criticism to Republican administrations. Byrd also wants Obama to limit claims of executive privilege while also ensuring that the White House czars don\u2019t have authority over Cabinet officers confirmed by the Senate.",

But his assurance Tuesday night that only the deserving will get help rang hollow. Even officials in his administration, many supporters of the plan in Congress and the Federal Reserve chairman expect some of that money will go to people who used lousy judgment. The president skipped over several complex economic circumstances in his speech to Congress - and may have started an international debate among trivia lovers and auto buffs over what country invented the car. A look at some of his assertions: OBAMA: \u201cWe have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It\u2019s a plan that won\u2019t help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values.\u201d THE FACTS: If the administration has come up with a way to ensure money only goes to those who got in honest trouble, it hasn\u2019t said so. Defending the program Tuesday at a Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said it\u2019s important to save those who made bad calls, for the greater good. He likened it to calling the fire department to put out a blaze caused by someone smoking in bed. \u201cI think the smart way to deal with a situation like that is to put out the fire, save him from his own consequences of his own action but then, going forward, enact penalties and set tougher rules about smoking in bed.\u201d Similarly, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested this month it\u2019s not likely aid will be denied to all homeowners who overstated their income or assets to get a mortgage they couldn\u2019t afford. \u201cI think it\u2019s just simply impractical to try to do a forensic analysis of each and every one of these delinquent loans,\u201d Sheila Bair told National Public Radio. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cAnd I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\u201d THE FACTS: Depends what your definition of automobiles, is. According to the Library of Congress, the inventor of the first true automobile was probably Germany\u2019s Karl Benz, who created the first auto powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine, in 1885 or 1886. In the U.S., Charles Duryea tested what library researchers called the first successful gas-powered car in 1893. Nobody disputes that Henry Ford created the first assembly line that made cars affordable. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cWe have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before.\u201d THE FACTS: Oil imports peaked in 2005 at just over 5 billion barrels, and have been declining slightly since. The figure in 2007 was 4.9 billion barrels, or about 58 percent of total consumption. The nation is on pace this year to import 4.7 billion barrels, and government projections are for imports to hold steady or decrease a bit over the next two decades. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cWe have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade.\u201d THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don\u2019t mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won\u2019t be 10 years from now. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cRegulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn\u2019t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.\u201d THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn\u2019t only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cIn this budget, we will end education programs that don\u2019t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don\u2019t need them. We\u2019ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we\u2019re not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don\u2019t use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn\u2019t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.\u201d THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That\u2019s all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama\u2019s proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress. Second, waste, fraud and abuse are routinely targeted by presidents who later find that the savings realized seldom amount to significant sums. Programs that a president might consider wasteful have staunch defenders in Congress who have fought off similar efforts in the past. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cThanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation\u2019s supply of renewable energy in the next three years.\u201d THE FACTS: While the president\u2019s stimulus package includes billions in aid for renewable energy and conservation, his goal is unlikely to be achieved through the recovery plan alone. In 2007, the U.S. produced 8.4 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, including hydroelectric dams, solar panels and windmills. Under the status quo, the Energy Department says, it will take more than two decades to boost that figure to 12.5 percent. If Obama is to achieve his much more ambitious goal, Congress would need to mandate it. That is the thrust of an energy bill that is expected to be introduced in coming weeks. \u2014 OBAMA: \u201cOver the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.\u201d THE FACTS: This is a recurrent Obama formulation. But job creation projections are uncertain even in stable times, and some of the economists relied on by Obama in making his forecast acknowledge a great deal of uncertainty in their numbers. The president\u2019s own economists, in a report prepared last month, stated, \u201cIt should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error.\u201d Beyond that, it\u2019s unlikely the nation will ever know how many jobs are saved as a result of the stimulus. While it\u2019s clear when jobs are abolished, there\u2019s no economic gauge that tracks job preservation. The estimates are based on economic assumptions of how many jobs would be lost without the stimulus. Senator Byrd: Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the longest-serving Democratic senator, is criticizing President Obama\u2019s appointment of White House \u201cczars\u201d to oversee federal policy, saying these executive positions amount to a power grab by the executive branch. In a letter to Obama on Wednesday, Byrd complained about Obama\u2019s decision to create White House offices on health reform, urban affairs policy, and energy and climate change. Byrd said such positions \u201ccan threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\u201d While it\u2019s rare for Byrd to criticize a president in his own party, Byrd is a stern constitutional scholar who has always stood up for the legislative branch in its role in checking the power of the White House. Byrd no longer holds the powerful Appropriations chairmanship, so his criticism does not carry as much weight these days. Byrd repeatedly clashed with the Bush administration over executive power, and it appears that he\u2019s not limiting his criticism to Republican administrations. Byrd also wants Obama to limit claims of executive privilege while also ensuring that the White House czars don\u2019t have authority over Cabinet officers confirmed by the Senate.",
