Doesn't even have to be in theater - I recall a couple of times a National Guard armory in the US was broken into during Vietnam by folks wanting things they shouldn't have. It's possible someone stole the items and cooked the books to cover it up - happened when the Soviet Union imploded and their military had some serious issues. For that matter, there have been cases in the US where corrupt police have diverted arms, drugs, etc., from the evidence locker back onto the street. Maybe the Taliban exerted pressure to get someone to divert the items to them (either do this or you and your family cease to exist). Only thing I would discount is one of our guys diverting the stuff to the Taliban, and even then it would not be beyond the realm of possibility someone would be that greedy or stupid.",
