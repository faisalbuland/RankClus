AHMED: Remember that today for President Obama his greatest headache is not coming from Rush Limbaugh and the Republicans. It's really coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan. He staked his reputation and his foreign policy in that part of the world. RUSH: So here you have the American University Chair of Islamic Studies, Akbar Ahmed, saying, \"Limbaugh and the Republicans are not Obama's greatest headache. It's Afghanistan and Pakistan.\" Pakistan's falling apart. Pakistan's falling apart, and the Taliban is taking over. They did a stupid thing. They advocated a stupid thing. They gave the Taliban a province, at the urging of the Obama administration. They gave the Taliban a province in Pakistan. \"Okay, you guys. You want to be the Taliban? Be the Taliban in this province,\" and guess what? The Taliban's taken over neighborhoods provinces, or trying to. Once again, even in Pakistan, they're exhibiting a total lack of understanding of the enemy -- of evil -- and what their intent is. And they have every intention of getting back in control in Afghanistan. Conservatives have allowed Limbaugh to become a spokesperson. They refuse to challenge him. Simply refuse to once and for all label him as the opportunist extreme nut job that he is. Do they really think they benefit from being associated with him? Dave",

Once again, even in Pakistan, they're exhibiting a total lack of understanding of the enemy -- of evil -- and what their intent is.
