They determined that a condition killed off the deep water species and the eggs were preserved deep below. Somethig disloged them or a water temp change hatched the eggs and the species re-emerged and multiplied. It became a popular fish called the tile fish and was in demand due to its delisious taste.

We do know that they can clone individual organs,and that there are injected substances from stem cell research that can instruct the bodies DNA to reproduce. So given that why is it so hard to believe that they are not experimenting on multiple cloning of different species of animals? Point is we dont know.

Im sure Walmart can get them on special order. I photograph on beaches two three times a week - Do you have ANY idea what happens to a body that floats around in the ocean for a week or two? Parts fuse, pieces of flesh fall off here and there, and the salt water smooths it all out. I once called in the cops to pick up a dead body, turned out to be a dead seal. And once what I thought was a dead seal was a dead human. And of course, these \"monsters\" might have had some human help. These creatures, are clearly air breathers, so you're going to say that no one spotted a live one? Dave",

This isnt about Bush for a change in case you didnt notice. This is why these threads denigrate so quickly it has to drag partisan politics into them. How about science and all the possibilities sourrounding this issue. I purposly post these type of threads to see the responses and how people think. Its a great education that re-enforces my beliefs on why we cant accomplish anything these days. We the people are our own worst enemies. John, you are absolutely correct and I apologize for my flip statement. I guess I have just fallen into the trap I generally advise conservatives to stay above that those on the left have been vocalizing for 8 years. I will in the future hold such comments to situations when the Democrat controlled Congress and Obama Administration take actions I consider harmful.",
