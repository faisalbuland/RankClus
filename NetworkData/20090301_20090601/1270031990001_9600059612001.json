        "content": "Thrust_0311 stated in another (now closed) thread that the ACLU has, as part of its OFFICIAL policy, the destruction of religion. I have challenged him to prove this assertion. He has ducked and dodged. Finally, the thread in which he made the claim was closed by a mod for being off-topic. I am therefore making this the topic of the thread: Thrust_0311 (or anyone else), prove what you said about the ACLU's \"official\" policy. Give a web address. Reference a researchable resource. Ideally, tell us what page of the ACLU's website (hint: it's a dot-org site, beginning with \"ACLU\") espouses this policy. Or, if you wish to retract that accusation, I'll consider this topic closed. This message has been edited. Last edited by: SteveDeHaven, Thu 05 March 2009 04:03 AM",
