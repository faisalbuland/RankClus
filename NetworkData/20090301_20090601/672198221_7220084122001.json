The people did not know exactly when the shutdowns would occur, but both say they will include the normal two-week closure in July to change from one model year to the next. Neither person wanted to be identified because workers have not been told of the shutdowns. GM spokesman Chris Lee would not comment other than to say the company notifies employees before making any production cuts public.

Many years ago the UAW rammed down the throats of the \"Detroit three\" in another round of \"pattern bargaining\" contract talks the policy that when ever a plant is temporarily closed, like for the holdays, which was extended this last holiday season and for the summer \"new model year re-tooling\" which is normally about two weeks and is looking to go to, at least for GM maybe nine weeks the blue collars UAW workers do not see any cut in pay, it is true that they need to go sign up for un-employment but the MAX amount even in a state like Michigan is something like 25 maybe 30 percent of what they make, even less for workers on the high end of the senoirity driven wage scale. The company, GM in this case has to make up the difference, so the savings are not all that much, maybe 20 percent overall. The free healthcare continues so there is no saving there. Included in this is all those thousands of \"job bank workers\" who have not really worked, many of them for years. There is also a sort of hidden cost in this. At least some workers would have taken vacation this summer during the seven weeks in question, now they don't have to, they have the time off anyway, so they will be free to take that vacation some other time when they otherwise would have to be at work. One of the savings will come from all those cars that they are not making and the parts that they now won't buy, but here again GM is screwed. Gm more than Ford and much more than Chrysler or Honda and Toyota for sure makes a very large percentages of their own parts. They buy the tires and fluids, motor oil etc. I believe they still make all there own glass, all the various electronics, radios, nav systems, all the computer boxes, the wiring harnesses that hook everything together are all made by Delphi, formerly DELCO as in DELCO-REMY as in AC-DELCO as in a branch of GM. I beleive that Delphi is still a part of GM. So again basically little if any savings. Even if they are not the workers are UAW workers, still covered by the same contract so they get the same sweetheart deal.",
