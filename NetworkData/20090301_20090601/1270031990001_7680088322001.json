        "content": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word: quote: c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433. Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah. Although based in the mystical, this is also based in the Judeo-Christian tree of religions. 3. Agnostics and atheists. Agnostics have no religion, and atheists do not believe in ANY deity. Pagans believe in at least one deity, possibly many. What do Pagans believe? That's like asking \"What do monotheists and trinitarians believe?\" Every branch is different. However, here are some core components that apply to MANY Pagans (but not all): 1. A belief in a higher power. This may be one deity or many. Some believe that there are many \"faces\" of God, and that these different manifestations are all ASPECTS of something infinite and eternal that can not be comprehended. Some traditions call that highest power the \"One.\" Some see the One manifested as two major aspects: The God and the Goddess, male and female. Some believe in many deities, all of which are separate and not part of one single higher power. Those are the polytheists. Some believe that ALL Gods are legitimate faces of the divine - the pantheists. Some believe in many gods, but focus on only one as a Patron deity. Many pagans honor mythologies that are not their own, and pay respect to deities that do not belong to their particular system. 2. The higher power is manifested in nature. Nature is NOT A GOD, but is symbolic of the higher power. Truth is seen in the cycles and balance of nature. A rock, a tree, a mountain, or an ocean may be powerfully symbolic, and may be honored as a spiritual gift, but those objects are NOT worshipped in most modern pagan practices. (Some ancient tribes and cultures believed that mountains were Gods, or that Gods lived on mountaintops. Mount Everest was revered in such a way for thousands of years.) 3. Many Pagans honor the four symbolic elements of earth, air, water, and fire. Remember, honor is not worship. The elements are recognized as both spiritual and physical gifts, each with symbolic meanings. 4. Some Pagans believe in an afterlife, such as Valhalla, or the Summerlands. Some believe in Reincarnation. Some believe that your energy simply flows back into the universe. 5. Many Pagans see wisdom as coming from many sources, but feel that no source has the absolute truth. 6. Some Pagans are reconstructionists, trying recreate ancient traditions as closely as possible. Some are okay taking what is known of the old ways and giving a new twist to it. Some combine traditions. Some create traditions. 7. Pagan religions are not \"anti-Christian.\" They're not anti-anything. They are what they are. The entire world view is different than the world views of the Judeo-Christian religions. Now, some of the myths. Here are things that modern Pagans DON'T DO: 1. Pagans do not do animal sacrifices. In fact, many that I know are vegetarians and vegans. 2. Pagans do not eat children. Seriously, I've heard that accusation, and it's just sick. 3. Pagans do not inflict self-harm. 4. Pagans do not make blood sacrifices. And one commentary: I've heard people make accusations of \"black magic\" and cults. I want people to remember that cults have formed out of every religion in history. Cruelty and maliciousness have come from every religion in history. There are Christian cult groups that participate in a practice called \"Imprecatory Prayer,\" in which prayer is intended to attack a person or group. That's black magic. Hell, the Branch Davidians were a Christian cult, basing their beliefs in the book of Revelations. And yes, there are Pagan individuals and groups that do malicious things. They exist, they're bad, and they're not affiliated with the vast majority of pagans. So, are all Pagans \"good?\" No. But not all \"Christians\" are good, nor all the people who subscribe to ANY religion. Here are some topics I will cover in upcoming posts: 1. The Wiccan Rede: \"Do what ye will, but harm none.\" 2. Rituals: What are they? 3. Pagans in modern life. And, of course, feel free to ask questions.",

        "content": "Whirled_Peas, I am glad you started this thread, I was thinking of something similar to show how some of the basic tenants of various belief systems are the same, much like the Wiccan Reade's ,\"Do what ye will but harm none\" and the assertion that what one does comes back three times over to the practicioner asserted in many books on pagan religions, which correspondes closely with \"Do unto others as ye would have them do unto thee\" that is expressed in several beliefs(The Golden Rule). What amazes me is the number of misconceptions regarding Wicca that I have seen. When in truth, while we may worship differant dieties, the meassage remains the same, respect and love. As far as \"Black Magic\" goes, that too is something that transcends religions of all kinds.

        "reply": "Whirled_Peas, I am glad you started this thread, I was thinking of something similar to show how some of the basic tenants of various belief systems are the same, much like the Wiccan Reade's ,\"Do what ye will but harm none\" and the assertion that what one does comes back three times over to the practicioner asserted in many books on pagan religions, which correspondes closely with \"Do unto others as ye would have them do unto thee\" that is expressed in several beliefs(The Golden Rule). What amazes me is the number of misconceptions regarding Wicca that I have seen. When in truth, while we may worship differant dieties, the meassage remains the same, respect and love. As far as \"Black Magic\" goes, that too is something that transcends religions of all kinds.

This religion did bad things, that religion did worse things.\" That's not what I want for this thread. The intent of this thread is to answer people's questions about modern Pagan religions so that people have an understanding of what it's really about. I admit, I almost slipped into the other mode, and I'll try not to let that happen again. This is an information thread, not a debate thread. If anyone wants to talk about Christianity or politics (communism, whatever), then take it to another thread.

I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books as the next step up. Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

This religion did bad things, that religion did worse things.\" That's not what I want for this thread. The intent of this thread is to answer people's questions about modern Pagan religions so that people have an understanding of what it's really about. I admit, I almost slipped into the other mode, and I'll try not to let that happen again. This is an information thread, not a debate thread. If anyone wants to talk about Christianity or politics (communism, whatever), then take it to another thread. There's plenty of opportunity to debate, but this is so that people can at least have an understanding of this topic. quote: In regards to the topic, Whirled_Peas, if you could point me in the direction of a few more in depth authors on Pagan beliefs I would be most apperciative, Silver RavenWolf while a good baseline, does not go as in depth as I would like and as you pointed out in another thread. I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books as the next step up. Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

It's a Wiccan concept, but is used by many modern pagans even if they aren't Wiccan. I'm Druid, and even I feel that the Wiccan Rede is a valuable rule. If there was a Pagan \"Commandment,\" this would be it. Most people try to claim that this means, \"Do whatever you want, without restraint, as long as you don't physically hurt someone else.\" That interpretation is WRONG. Let's take a look at what \"harm none\" really means. First, what is \"harm\"? Yes, if you steal from someone, physically assault someone, or murder someone, that's harm, of course. But it also causes harm when you insult a person. It causes harm when you release toxic pollutants into the environment which make people sick or contaminate crops. It causes harm when you take more than you need, and others are left with none. It causes harm when you support an organization that perpetuates abuse (overseas sweatshop workers, child labor, unfair wages). It causes harm when you destroy ANYTHING needlessly. It causes harm when you denigrate a person to a sub-human status. It causes harm when you lie to people. It causes harm when you hinder the spiritual path of a person. It causes harm when you make a person feel worthless, and thereby hindering that person's confidence and ability to fully live. In all actions, if you live by the Wiccan Rede, you need to ensure that you are not causing harm to anyone else, whether spiritually, physically, or emotionally. To whom does this apply? EVERYONE. The child working in the sweatshop in Taiwan, the homeless man living under a bridge, your neighbor, your spouse, your children, AND YOU. Yes, \"harm none\" means you can't do harm to yourself either. How can you harm yourself? This isn't just about suicide or inflicting self-injury. While that's included, we're also talking about spiritual and emotional harm. We're talking about your health. If you eat french fries until you weigh 600 pounds, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, type-II diabetes, and can't move except to pick up the phone and order another pizza... you've harmed yourself. (You've also harmed those around you, if you think about it.) If you shut off your mind, never read, and never let yourself grow intellectually, you have done yourself harm. If you shut yourself off from the world and never interact with other people, you do yourself emotional and spiritual harm. You're stunting yourself. When you hurt others, you cause spiritual damage to yourself. In short, this means that whatever choices and actions you make, if you follow the Wiccan Rede, you must be sure that you are not harming yourself or others in any way. Actions must be neutral or positive. When you consider the fact that this can apply to ANY situation and EVERY person or living creature, then it's a very powerful and complex oath to follow.",

I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word: quote: c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433. Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah. Although based in the mystical, this is also based in the Judeo-Christian tree of religions. 3. Agnostics and atheists. Agnostics have no religion, and atheists do not believe in ANY deity. Pagans believe in at least one deity, possibly many. What do Pagans believe? That's like asking \"What do monotheists and trinitarians believe?\" Every branch is different. However, here are some core components that apply to MANY Pagans (but not all): 1. A belief in a higher power. This may be one deity or many. Some believe that there are many \"faces\" of God, and that these different manifestations are all ASPECTS of something infinite and eternal that can not be comprehended. Some traditions call that highest power the \"One.\" Some see the One manifested as two major aspects: The God and the Goddess, male and female. Some believe in many deities, all of which are separate and not part of one single higher power. Those are the polytheists. Some believe that ALL Gods are legitimate faces of the divine - the pantheists. Some believe in many gods, but focus on only one as a Patron deity. Many pagans honor mythologies that are not their own, and pay respect to deities that do not belong to their particular system. 2. The higher power is manifested in nature. Nature is NOT A GOD, but is symbolic of the higher power. Truth is seen in the cycles and balance of nature. A rock, a tree, a mountain, or an ocean may be powerfully symbolic, and may be honored as a spiritual gift, but those objects are NOT worshipped in most modern pagan practices. (Some ancient tribes and cultures believed that mountains were Gods, or that Gods lived on mountaintops. Mount Everest was revered in such a way for thousands of years.) 3. Many Pagans honor the four symbolic elements of earth, air, water, and fire. Remember, honor is not worship. The elements are recognized as both spiritual and physical gifts, each with symbolic meanings. 4. Some Pagans believe in an afterlife, such as Valhalla, or the Summerlands. Some believe in Reincarnation. Some believe that your energy simply flows back into the universe. 5. Many Pagans see wisdom as coming from many sources, but feel that no source has the absolute truth. 6. Some Pagans are reconstructionists, trying recreate ancient traditions as closely as possible. Some are okay taking what is known of the old ways and giving a new twist to it. Some combine traditions. Some create traditions. 7. Pagan religions are not \"anti-Christian.\" They're not anti-anything. They are what they are. The entire world view is different than the world views of the Judeo-Christian religions. Now, some of the myths. Here are things that modern Pagans DON'T DO: 1. Pagans do not do animal sacrifices. In fact, many that I know are vegetarians and vegans. 2. Pagans do not eat children. Seriously, I've heard that accusation, and it's just sick. 3. Pagans do not inflict self-harm. 4. Pagans do not make blood sacrifices. And one commentary: I've heard people make accusations of \"black magic\" and cults. I want people to remember that cults have formed out of every religion in history. Cruelty and maliciousness have come from every religion in history. There are Christian cult groups that participate in a practice called \"Imprecatory Prayer,\" in which prayer is intended to attack a person or group. That's black magic. Hell, the Branch Davidians were a Christian cult, basing their beliefs in the book of Revelations. And yes, there are Pagan individuals and groups that do malicious things. They exist, they're bad, and they're not affiliated with the vast majority of pagans. So, are all Pagans \"good?\" No. But not all \"Christians\" are good, nor all the people who subscribe to ANY religion. Here are some topics I will cover in upcoming posts: 1. The Wiccan Rede: \"Do what ye will, but harm none.\" 2. Rituals: What are they? 3. Pagans in modern life. And, of course, feel free to ask questions.",

        "reply": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do.

What amazes me is the number of misconceptions regarding Wicca that I have seen. When in truth, while we may worship differant dieties, the meassage remains the same, respect and love. As far as \"Black Magic\" goes, that too is something that transcends religions of all kinds. From the curse tablets of ancient Persia and Greece, to the prayers left behind by some Christian groups and people, all the way to modern times where not too long ago a person was expelled from a school and facing a court case for putting a \"hex\" on a teacher. People may not like to admit it, but there is far more in the various belief systems used by humans to unite people than to divide them, but alas, we seem to not see the forest because of the trees... I will add this, anyone wanting a fairly easy to understand guide on Wicca should take a look at the works of Silver RavenWolf, she may not speak for all Wiccans, but the basics are sound and laid out in a manner even the least faithful and most cynical of critics can grasp and they are also expressed in a way to hold ones interest, and more knowledge is never a bad thing. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

        "reply": "Whirled_Peas, I am glad you started this thread, I was thinking of something similar to show how some of the basic tenants of various belief systems are the same, much like the Wiccan Reade's ,\"Do what ye will but harm none\" and the assertion that what one does comes back three times over to the practicioner asserted in many books on pagan religions, which correspondes closely with \"Do unto others as ye would have them do unto thee\" that is expressed in several beliefs(The Golden Rule). What amazes me is the number of misconceptions regarding Wicca that I have seen. When in truth, while we may worship differant dieties, the meassage remains the same, respect and love. As far as \"Black Magic\" goes, that too is something that transcends religions of all kinds. From the curse tablets of ancient Persia and Greece, to the prayers left behind by some Christian groups and people, all the way to modern times where not too long ago a person was expelled from a school and facing a court case for putting a \"hex\" on a teacher. People may not like to admit it, but there is far more in the various belief systems used by humans to unite people than to divide them, but alas, we seem to not see the forest because of the trees... I will add this, anyone wanting a fairly easy to understand guide on Wicca should take a look at the works of Silver RavenWolf, she may not speak for all Wiccans, but the basics are sound and laid out in a manner even the least faithful and most cynical of critics can grasp and they are also expressed in a way to hold ones interest, and more knowledge is never a bad thing. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books as the next step up. Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

It's a Wiccan concept, but is used by many modern pagans even if they aren't Wiccan. I'm Druid, and even I feel that the Wiccan Rede is a valuable rule. If there was a Pagan \"Commandment,\" this would be it. Most people try to claim that this means, \"Do whatever you want, without restraint, as long as you don't physically hurt someone else.\" That interpretation is WRONG. Let's take a look at what \"harm none\" really means. First, what is \"harm\"? Yes, if you steal from someone, physically assault someone, or murder someone, that's harm, of course. But it also causes harm when you insult a person. It causes harm when you release toxic pollutants into the environment which make people sick or contaminate crops. It causes harm when you take more than you need, and others are left with none. It causes harm when you support an organization that perpetuates abuse (overseas sweatshop workers, child labor, unfair wages). It causes harm when you destroy ANYTHING needlessly. It causes harm when you denigrate a person to a sub-human status. It causes harm when you lie to people. It causes harm when you hinder the spiritual path of a person. It causes harm when you make a person feel worthless, and thereby hindering that person's confidence and ability to fully live. In all actions, if you live by the Wiccan Rede, you need to ensure that you are not causing harm to anyone else, whether spiritually, physically, or emotionally. To whom does this apply? EVERYONE. The child working in the sweatshop in Taiwan, the homeless man living under a bridge, your neighbor, your spouse, your children, AND YOU. Yes, \"harm none\" means you can't do harm to yourself either. How can you harm yourself? This isn't just about suicide or inflicting self-injury. While that's included, we're also talking about spiritual and emotional harm. We're talking about your health. If you eat french fries until you weigh 600 pounds, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, type-II diabetes, and can't move except to pick up the phone and order another pizza... you've harmed yourself. (You've also harmed those around you, if you think about it.) If you shut off your mind, never read, and never let yourself grow intellectually, you have done yourself harm. If you shut yourself off from the world and never interact with other people, you do yourself emotional and spiritual harm. You're stunting yourself. When you hurt others, you cause spiritual damage to yourself. In short, this means that whatever choices and actions you make, if you follow the Wiccan Rede, you must be sure that you are not harming yourself or others in any way. Actions must be neutral or positive. When you consider the fact that this can apply to ANY situation and EVERY person or living creature, then it's a very powerful and complex oath to follow.",

        "content": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word: quote: c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433. Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah. Although based in the mystical, this is also based in the Judeo-Christian tree of religions. 3. Agnostics and atheists. Agnostics have no religion, and atheists do not believe in ANY deity. Pagans believe in at least one deity, possibly many. What do Pagans believe? That's like asking \"What do monotheists and trinitarians believe?\" Every branch is different. However, here are some core components that apply to MANY Pagans (but not all): 1. A belief in a higher power. This may be one deity or many. Some believe that there are many \"faces\" of God, and that these different manifestations are all ASPECTS of something infinite and eternal that can not be comprehended. Some traditions call that highest power the \"One.\" Some see the One manifested as two major aspects: The God and the Goddess, male and female. Some believe in many deities, all of which are separate and not part of one single higher power. Those are the polytheists. Some believe that ALL Gods are legitimate faces of the divine - the pantheists. Some believe in many gods, but focus on only one as a Patron deity. Many pagans honor mythologies that are not their own, and pay respect to deities that do not belong to their particular system. 2. The higher power is manifested in nature. Nature is NOT A GOD, but is symbolic of the higher power. Truth is seen in the cycles and balance of nature. A rock, a tree, a mountain, or an ocean may be powerfully symbolic, and may be honored as a spiritual gift, but those objects are NOT worshipped in most modern pagan practices. (Some ancient tribes and cultures believed that mountains were Gods, or that Gods lived on mountaintops. Mount Everest was revered in such a way for thousands of years.) 3. Many Pagans honor the four symbolic elements of earth, air, water, and fire. Remember, honor is not worship. The elements are recognized as both spiritual and physical gifts, each with symbolic meanings. 4. Some Pagans believe in an afterlife, such as Valhalla, or the Summerlands. Some believe in Reincarnation. Some believe that your energy simply flows back into the universe. 5. Many Pagans see wisdom as coming from many sources, but feel that no source has the absolute truth. 6. Some Pagans are reconstructionists, trying recreate ancient traditions as closely as possible. Some are okay taking what is known of the old ways and giving a new twist to it. Some combine traditions. Some create traditions. 7. Pagan religions are not \"anti-Christian.\" They're not anti-anything. They are what they are. The entire world view is different than the world views of the Judeo-Christian religions. Now, some of the myths. Here are things that modern Pagans DON'T DO: 1. Pagans do not do animal sacrifices. In fact, many that I know are vegetarians and vegans. 2. Pagans do not eat children. Seriously, I've heard that accusation, and it's just sick. 3. Pagans do not inflict self-harm. 4. Pagans do not make blood sacrifices. And one commentary: I've heard people make accusations of \"black magic\" and cults. I want people to remember that cults have formed out of every religion in history. Cruelty and maliciousness have come from every religion in history. There are Christian cult groups that participate in a practice called \"Imprecatory Prayer,\" in which prayer is intended to attack a person or group. That's black magic. Hell, the Branch Davidians were a Christian cult, basing their beliefs in the book of Revelations. And yes, there are Pagan individuals and groups that do malicious things. They exist, they're bad, and they're not affiliated with the vast majority of pagans. So, are all Pagans \"good?\" No. But not all \"Christians\" are good, nor all the people who subscribe to ANY religion. Here are some topics I will cover in upcoming posts: 1. The Wiccan Rede: \"Do what ye will, but harm none.\" 2. Rituals: What are they? 3. Pagans in modern life. And, of course, feel free to ask questions.",

        "reply": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means.

What amazes me is the number of misconceptions regarding Wicca that I have seen. When in truth, while we may worship differant dieties, the meassage remains the same, respect and love. As far as \"Black Magic\" goes, that too is something that transcends religions of all kinds. From the curse tablets of ancient Persia and Greece, to the prayers left behind by some Christian groups and people, all the way to modern times where not too long ago a person was expelled from a school and facing a court case for putting a \"hex\" on a teacher. People may not like to admit it, but there is far more in the various belief systems used by humans to unite people than to divide them, but alas, we seem to not see the forest because of the trees... I will add this, anyone wanting a fairly easy to understand guide on Wicca should take a look at the works of Silver RavenWolf, she may not speak for all Wiccans, but the basics are sound and laid out in a manner even the least faithful and most cynical of critics can grasp and they are also expressed in a way to hold ones interest, and more knowledge is never a bad thing. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

        "reply": "Whirled_Peas, I am glad you started this thread, I was thinking of something similar to show how some of the basic tenants of various belief systems are the same, much like the Wiccan Reade's ,\"Do what ye will but harm none\" and the assertion that what one does comes back three times over to the practicioner asserted in many books on pagan religions, which correspondes closely with \"Do unto others as ye would have them do unto thee\" that is expressed in several beliefs(The Golden Rule). What amazes me is the number of misconceptions regarding Wicca that I have seen. When in truth, while we may worship differant dieties, the meassage remains the same, respect and love. As far as \"Black Magic\" goes, that too is something that transcends religions of all kinds. From the curse tablets of ancient Persia and Greece, to the prayers left behind by some Christian groups and people, all the way to modern times where not too long ago a person was expelled from a school and facing a court case for putting a \"hex\" on a teacher. People may not like to admit it, but there is far more in the various belief systems used by humans to unite people than to divide them, but alas, we seem to not see the forest because of the trees... I will add this, anyone wanting a fairly easy to understand guide on Wicca should take a look at the works of Silver RavenWolf, she may not speak for all Wiccans, but the basics are sound and laid out in a manner even the least faithful and most cynical of critics can grasp and they are also expressed in a way to hold ones interest, and more knowledge is never a bad thing. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books as the next step up. Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

It's a Wiccan concept, but is used by many modern pagans even if they aren't Wiccan. I'm Druid, and even I feel that the Wiccan Rede is a valuable rule. If there was a Pagan \"Commandment,\" this would be it. Most people try to claim that this means, \"Do whatever you want, without restraint, as long as you don't physically hurt someone else.\" That interpretation is WRONG. Let's take a look at what \"harm none\" really means. First, what is \"harm\"? Yes, if you steal from someone, physically assault someone, or murder someone, that's harm, of course. But it also causes harm when you insult a person. It causes harm when you release toxic pollutants into the environment which make people sick or contaminate crops. It causes harm when you take more than you need, and others are left with none. It causes harm when you support an organization that perpetuates abuse (overseas sweatshop workers, child labor, unfair wages). It causes harm when you destroy ANYTHING needlessly. It causes harm when you denigrate a person to a sub-human status. It causes harm when you lie to people. It causes harm when you hinder the spiritual path of a person. It causes harm when you make a person feel worthless, and thereby hindering that person's confidence and ability to fully live. In all actions, if you live by the Wiccan Rede, you need to ensure that you are not causing harm to anyone else, whether spiritually, physically, or emotionally. To whom does this apply? EVERYONE. The child working in the sweatshop in Taiwan, the homeless man living under a bridge, your neighbor, your spouse, your children, AND YOU. Yes, \"harm none\" means you can't do harm to yourself either. How can you harm yourself? This isn't just about suicide or inflicting self-injury. While that's included, we're also talking about spiritual and emotional harm. We're talking about your health. If you eat french fries until you weigh 600 pounds, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, type-II diabetes, and can't move except to pick up the phone and order another pizza... you've harmed yourself. (You've also harmed those around you, if you think about it.) If you shut off your mind, never read, and never let yourself grow intellectually, you have done yourself harm. If you shut yourself off from the world and never interact with other people, you do yourself emotional and spiritual harm. You're stunting yourself. When you hurt others, you cause spiritual damage to yourself. In short, this means that whatever choices and actions you make, if you follow the Wiccan Rede, you must be sure that you are not harming yourself or others in any way. Actions must be neutral or positive. When you consider the fact that this can apply to ANY situation and EVERY person or living creature, then it's a very powerful and complex oath to follow.",

        "content": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word: quote: c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433. Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah. Although based in the mystical, this is also based in the Judeo-Christian tree of religions. 3. Agnostics and atheists. Agnostics have no religion, and atheists do not believe in ANY deity. Pagans believe in at least one deity, possibly many. What do Pagans believe? That's like asking \"What do monotheists and trinitarians believe?\" Every branch is different. However, here are some core components that apply to MANY Pagans (but not all): 1. A belief in a higher power. This may be one deity or many. Some believe that there are many \"faces\" of God, and that these different manifestations are all ASPECTS of something infinite and eternal that can not be comprehended. Some traditions call that highest power the \"One.\" Some see the One manifested as two major aspects: The God and the Goddess, male and female. Some believe in many deities, all of which are separate and not part of one single higher power. Those are the polytheists. Some believe that ALL Gods are legitimate faces of the divine - the pantheists. Some believe in many gods, but focus on only one as a Patron deity. Many pagans honor mythologies that are not their own, and pay respect to deities that do not belong to their particular system. 2. The higher power is manifested in nature. Nature is NOT A GOD, but is symbolic of the higher power. Truth is seen in the cycles and balance of nature. A rock, a tree, a mountain, or an ocean may be powerfully symbolic, and may be honored as a spiritual gift, but those objects are NOT worshipped in most modern pagan practices. (Some ancient tribes and cultures believed that mountains were Gods, or that Gods lived on mountaintops. Mount Everest was revered in such a way for thousands of years.) 3. Many Pagans honor the four symbolic elements of earth, air, water, and fire. Remember, honor is not worship. The elements are recognized as both spiritual and physical gifts, each with symbolic meanings. 4. Some Pagans believe in an afterlife, such as Valhalla, or the Summerlands. Some believe in Reincarnation. Some believe that your energy simply flows back into the universe. 5. Many Pagans see wisdom as coming from many sources, but feel that no source has the absolute truth. 6. Some Pagans are reconstructionists, trying recreate ancient traditions as closely as possible. Some are okay taking what is known of the old ways and giving a new twist to it. Some combine traditions. Some create traditions. 7. Pagan religions are not \"anti-Christian.\" They're not anti-anything. They are what they are. The entire world view is different than the world views of the Judeo-Christian religions. Now, some of the myths. Here are things that modern Pagans DON'T DO: 1. Pagans do not do animal sacrifices. In fact, many that I know are vegetarians and vegans. 2. Pagans do not eat children. Seriously, I've heard that accusation, and it's just sick. 3. Pagans do not inflict self-harm. 4. Pagans do not make blood sacrifices. And one commentary: I've heard people make accusations of \"black magic\" and cults. I want people to remember that cults have formed out of every religion in history. Cruelty and maliciousness have come from every religion in history. There are Christian cult groups that participate in a practice called \"Imprecatory Prayer,\" in which prayer is intended to attack a person or group. That's black magic. Hell, the Branch Davidians were a Christian cult, basing their beliefs in the book of Revelations. And yes, there are Pagan individuals and groups that do malicious things. They exist, they're bad, and they're not affiliated with the vast majority of pagans. So, are all Pagans \"good?\" No. But not all \"Christians\" are good, nor all the people who subscribe to ANY religion. Here are some topics I will cover in upcoming posts: 1. The Wiccan Rede: \"Do what ye will, but harm none.\" 2. Rituals: What are they? 3. Pagans in modern life. And, of course, feel free to ask questions.",

        "quote": "c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433.", 
        "reply": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word:  Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point.

People may not like to admit it, but there is far more in the various belief systems used by humans to unite people than to divide them, but alas, we seem to not see the forest because of the trees... I will add this, anyone wanting a fairly easy to understand guide on Wicca should take a look at the works of Silver RavenWolf, she may not speak for all Wiccans, but the basics are sound and laid out in a manner even the least faithful and most cynical of critics can grasp and they are also expressed in a way to hold ones interest, and more knowledge is never a bad thing. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books as the next step up. Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

It's a Wiccan concept, but is used by many modern pagans even if they aren't Wiccan. I'm Druid, and even I feel that the Wiccan Rede is a valuable rule. If there was a Pagan \"Commandment,\" this would be it. Most people try to claim that this means, \"Do whatever you want, without restraint, as long as you don't physically hurt someone else.\" That interpretation is WRONG. Let's take a look at what \"harm none\" really means. First, what is \"harm\"? Yes, if you steal from someone, physically assault someone, or murder someone, that's harm, of course. But it also causes harm when you insult a person. It causes harm when you release toxic pollutants into the environment which make people sick or contaminate crops. It causes harm when you take more than you need, and others are left with none. It causes harm when you support an organization that perpetuates abuse (overseas sweatshop workers, child labor, unfair wages). It causes harm when you destroy ANYTHING needlessly. It causes harm when you denigrate a person to a sub-human status. It causes harm when you lie to people. It causes harm when you hinder the spiritual path of a person. It causes harm when you make a person feel worthless, and thereby hindering that person's confidence and ability to fully live. In all actions, if you live by the Wiccan Rede, you need to ensure that you are not causing harm to anyone else, whether spiritually, physically, or emotionally. To whom does this apply? EVERYONE. The child working in the sweatshop in Taiwan, the homeless man living under a bridge, your neighbor, your spouse, your children, AND YOU. Yes, \"harm none\" means you can't do harm to yourself either. How can you harm yourself? This isn't just about suicide or inflicting self-injury. While that's included, we're also talking about spiritual and emotional harm. We're talking about your health. If you eat french fries until you weigh 600 pounds, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, type-II diabetes, and can't move except to pick up the phone and order another pizza... you've harmed yourself. (You've also harmed those around you, if you think about it.) If you shut off your mind, never read, and never let yourself grow intellectually, you have done yourself harm. If you shut yourself off from the world and never interact with other people, you do yourself emotional and spiritual harm. You're stunting yourself. When you hurt others, you cause spiritual damage to yourself. In short, this means that whatever choices and actions you make, if you follow the Wiccan Rede, you must be sure that you are not harming yourself or others in any way. Actions must be neutral or positive. When you consider the fact that this can apply to ANY situation and EVERY person or living creature, then it's a very powerful and complex oath to follow.",

        "content": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word: quote: c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433. Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah. Although based in the mystical, this is also based in the Judeo-Christian tree of religions. 3. Agnostics and atheists. Agnostics have no religion, and atheists do not believe in ANY deity. Pagans believe in at least one deity, possibly many. What do Pagans believe? That's like asking \"What do monotheists and trinitarians believe?\" Every branch is different. However, here are some core components that apply to MANY Pagans (but not all): 1. A belief in a higher power. This may be one deity or many. Some believe that there are many \"faces\" of God, and that these different manifestations are all ASPECTS of something infinite and eternal that can not be comprehended. Some traditions call that highest power the \"One.\" Some see the One manifested as two major aspects: The God and the Goddess, male and female. Some believe in many deities, all of which are separate and not part of one single higher power. Those are the polytheists. Some believe that ALL Gods are legitimate faces of the divine - the pantheists. Some believe in many gods, but focus on only one as a Patron deity. Many pagans honor mythologies that are not their own, and pay respect to deities that do not belong to their particular system. 2. The higher power is manifested in nature. Nature is NOT A GOD, but is symbolic of the higher power. Truth is seen in the cycles and balance of nature. A rock, a tree, a mountain, or an ocean may be powerfully symbolic, and may be honored as a spiritual gift, but those objects are NOT worshipped in most modern pagan practices. (Some ancient tribes and cultures believed that mountains were Gods, or that Gods lived on mountaintops. Mount Everest was revered in such a way for thousands of years.) 3. Many Pagans honor the four symbolic elements of earth, air, water, and fire. Remember, honor is not worship. The elements are recognized as both spiritual and physical gifts, each with symbolic meanings. 4. Some Pagans believe in an afterlife, such as Valhalla, or the Summerlands. Some believe in Reincarnation. Some believe that your energy simply flows back into the universe. 5. Many Pagans see wisdom as coming from many sources, but feel that no source has the absolute truth. 6. Some Pagans are reconstructionists, trying recreate ancient traditions as closely as possible. Some are okay taking what is known of the old ways and giving a new twist to it. Some combine traditions. Some create traditions. 7. Pagan religions are not \"anti-Christian.\" They're not anti-anything. They are what they are. The entire world view is different than the world views of the Judeo-Christian religions. Now, some of the myths. Here are things that modern Pagans DON'T DO: 1. Pagans do not do animal sacrifices. In fact, many that I know are vegetarians and vegans. 2. Pagans do not eat children. Seriously, I've heard that accusation, and it's just sick. 3. Pagans do not inflict self-harm. 4. Pagans do not make blood sacrifices. And one commentary: I've heard people make accusations of \"black magic\" and cults. I want people to remember that cults have formed out of every religion in history. Cruelty and maliciousness have come from every religion in history. There are Christian cult groups that participate in a practice called \"Imprecatory Prayer,\" in which prayer is intended to attack a person or group. That's black magic. Hell, the Branch Davidians were a Christian cult, basing their beliefs in the book of Revelations. And yes, there are Pagan individuals and groups that do malicious things. They exist, they're bad, and they're not affiliated with the vast majority of pagans. So, are all Pagans \"good?\" No. But not all \"Christians\" are good, nor all the people who subscribe to ANY religion. Here are some topics I will cover in upcoming posts: 1. The Wiccan Rede: \"Do what ye will, but harm none.\" 2. Rituals: What are they? 3. Pagans in modern life. And, of course, feel free to ask questions.",

        "quote": "c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433.", 
        "reply": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word:  Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah.

His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books as the next step up. Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

It's a Wiccan concept, but is used by many modern pagans even if they aren't Wiccan. I'm Druid, and even I feel that the Wiccan Rede is a valuable rule. If there was a Pagan \"Commandment,\" this would be it. Most people try to claim that this means, \"Do whatever you want, without restraint, as long as you don't physically hurt someone else.\" That interpretation is WRONG. Let's take a look at what \"harm none\" really means. First, what is \"harm\"? Yes, if you steal from someone, physically assault someone, or murder someone, that's harm, of course. But it also causes harm when you insult a person. It causes harm when you release toxic pollutants into the environment which make people sick or contaminate crops. It causes harm when you take more than you need, and others are left with none. It causes harm when you support an organization that perpetuates abuse (overseas sweatshop workers, child labor, unfair wages). It causes harm when you destroy ANYTHING needlessly. It causes harm when you denigrate a person to a sub-human status. It causes harm when you lie to people. It causes harm when you hinder the spiritual path of a person. It causes harm when you make a person feel worthless, and thereby hindering that person's confidence and ability to fully live. In all actions, if you live by the Wiccan Rede, you need to ensure that you are not causing harm to anyone else, whether spiritually, physically, or emotionally. To whom does this apply? EVERYONE. The child working in the sweatshop in Taiwan, the homeless man living under a bridge, your neighbor, your spouse, your children, AND YOU. Yes, \"harm none\" means you can't do harm to yourself either. How can you harm yourself? This isn't just about suicide or inflicting self-injury. While that's included, we're also talking about spiritual and emotional harm. We're talking about your health. If you eat french fries until you weigh 600 pounds, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, type-II diabetes, and can't move except to pick up the phone and order another pizza... you've harmed yourself. (You've also harmed those around you, if you think about it.) If you shut off your mind, never read, and never let yourself grow intellectually, you have done yourself harm. If you shut yourself off from the world and never interact with other people, you do yourself emotional and spiritual harm. You're stunting yourself. When you hurt others, you cause spiritual damage to yourself. In short, this means that whatever choices and actions you make, if you follow the Wiccan Rede, you must be sure that you are not harming yourself or others in any way. Actions must be neutral or positive. When you consider the fact that this can apply to ANY situation and EVERY person or living creature, then it's a very powerful and complex oath to follow.",

        "content": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word: quote: c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433. Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah. Although based in the mystical, this is also based in the Judeo-Christian tree of religions. 3. Agnostics and atheists. Agnostics have no religion, and atheists do not believe in ANY deity. Pagans believe in at least one deity, possibly many. What do Pagans believe? That's like asking \"What do monotheists and trinitarians believe?\" Every branch is different. However, here are some core components that apply to MANY Pagans (but not all): 1. A belief in a higher power. This may be one deity or many. Some believe that there are many \"faces\" of God, and that these different manifestations are all ASPECTS of something infinite and eternal that can not be comprehended. Some traditions call that highest power the \"One.\" Some see the One manifested as two major aspects: The God and the Goddess, male and female. Some believe in many deities, all of which are separate and not part of one single higher power. Those are the polytheists. Some believe that ALL Gods are legitimate faces of the divine - the pantheists. Some believe in many gods, but focus on only one as a Patron deity. Many pagans honor mythologies that are not their own, and pay respect to deities that do not belong to their particular system. 2. The higher power is manifested in nature. Nature is NOT A GOD, but is symbolic of the higher power. Truth is seen in the cycles and balance of nature. A rock, a tree, a mountain, or an ocean may be powerfully symbolic, and may be honored as a spiritual gift, but those objects are NOT worshipped in most modern pagan practices. (Some ancient tribes and cultures believed that mountains were Gods, or that Gods lived on mountaintops. Mount Everest was revered in such a way for thousands of years.) 3. Many Pagans honor the four symbolic elements of earth, air, water, and fire. Remember, honor is not worship. The elements are recognized as both spiritual and physical gifts, each with symbolic meanings. 4. Some Pagans believe in an afterlife, such as Valhalla, or the Summerlands. Some believe in Reincarnation. Some believe that your energy simply flows back into the universe. 5. Many Pagans see wisdom as coming from many sources, but feel that no source has the absolute truth. 6. Some Pagans are reconstructionists, trying recreate ancient traditions as closely as possible. Some are okay taking what is known of the old ways and giving a new twist to it. Some combine traditions. Some create traditions. 7. Pagan religions are not \"anti-Christian.\" They're not anti-anything. They are what they are. The entire world view is different than the world views of the Judeo-Christian religions. Now, some of the myths. Here are things that modern Pagans DON'T DO: 1. Pagans do not do animal sacrifices. In fact, many that I know are vegetarians and vegans. 2. Pagans do not eat children. Seriously, I've heard that accusation, and it's just sick. 3. Pagans do not inflict self-harm. 4. Pagans do not make blood sacrifices. And one commentary: I've heard people make accusations of \"black magic\" and cults. I want people to remember that cults have formed out of every religion in history. Cruelty and maliciousness have come from every religion in history. There are Christian cult groups that participate in a practice called \"Imprecatory Prayer,\" in which prayer is intended to attack a person or group. That's black magic. Hell, the Branch Davidians were a Christian cult, basing their beliefs in the book of Revelations. And yes, there are Pagan individuals and groups that do malicious things. They exist, they're bad, and they're not affiliated with the vast majority of pagans. So, are all Pagans \"good?\" No. But not all \"Christians\" are good, nor all the people who subscribe to ANY religion. Here are some topics I will cover in upcoming posts: 1. The Wiccan Rede: \"Do what ye will, but harm none.\" 2. Rituals: What are they? 3. Pagans in modern life. And, of course, feel free to ask questions.",

        "quote": "c.1375, from L.L. paganus \"pagan,\" in classical L. \"villager, rustic, civilian,\" from pagus \"rural district,\" originally \"district limited by markers,\" thus related to pangere \"to fix, fasten,\" from PIE base *pag- \"to fix\" (see pact). Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for \"civilian, incompetent soldier,\" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites \"soldier of Christ,\" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908. Paganism is attested from 1433.", 
        "reply": "In many of my conversations here and elsewhere, it's clear that a lot of the prejudices against Pagans stems from a profound misunderstanding based on media imagery, fairy tales (literally), and even the things people are told by their religious leaders. I think some of this needs to change. It's against my nature to preach or proselytize beliefs. I have no underlying motivation to convert anyone. This thread is for the purpose of EXPLANATION. It's for debunking myths, explaining beliefs, outlining actual practices, and even explaining WHY Pagans believe as they do. If you are here to argue against Paganism and issue condemnations based on your religion, you're on the wrong thread, and I'll flag you faster than you can pout. If you're here to ask questions, please, ask anything you wish. Let's get started. Paganism is an umbrella term covering a large number of religions, some ancient and some relatively modern. The term does NOT mean \"devil-worshipper\" or any of the other ridiculous things people have said it means. Here's the actual meaning, AND etymology of the word:  Pagans, quite simply, are those who follow the religion and ways of the \"rural\" people or the \"common folk.\" It became a term of condemnation by the Christian armies that tried to force conversion at sword-point. Today, people who are reclaiming the old ways and a nature-based spirituality have also reclaimed the word. To whom does it apply? 1. Wiccans (modern composite Pagan religion), Druids (Celtic), Heathens (Norse), and also those few who follow the Greek or Roman Pantheons. 2. \"New Age\" spiritualists sometimes put themselves under the Pagan umbrella. 3. SOME people consider Hinduism, Native American beliefs, and other aboriginal beliefs to be Pagan religions. To whom does it NOT apply? 1. Satanists. Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure and does not appear in ANY Pagan religion. Satanism is more closely related to Christianity than Pagan religions. 2. Kabbalah. Although based in the mystical, this is also based in the Judeo-Christian tree of religions. 3. Agnostics and atheists. Agnostics have no religion, and atheists do not believe in ANY deity. Pagans believe in at least one deity, possibly many. What do Pagans believe? That's like asking \"What do monotheists and trinitarians believe?\" Every branch is different.

I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books as the next step up. Start with \"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\" and its follow-up book, \"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\" Again, it's Wicca, but it's a bit better, I feel, than Ravenwolf's stuff. Also, Cunningham has many good reference books. I like his \"Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,\" which not only gives magical and symbolic uses of hundreds of plants, but also medicinal uses. Great reference guide. Next, read \"Drawing Down the Moon\" by Margot Adler. It's got a lot of history and explanation, which is right up your alley. A bit thicker, a bit more academic. I'm a Druid, which is a Pagan path that is a bit less understood and a bit harder to pin down. Different groups of Druids have different takes on it. Some try to be \"reconstructionists,\" in an attempt to re-create the old Druidic order. Others take inspiration from what we know of the ancient Druids and then BUILD on that. Others simply use Celtic culture as a base. Modern Wicca has a good portion of its system based in the Celtic ways, so some of what you read would seem to be similar, and that's not a bad thing. I'm not completely happy with any of the individual Druid books I've read, but I take a little bit from each one and try to piece it together. I've not found any single book that is a perfect starting point, but I'd say \"The Celtic Druids' Year\" by John King is as good a starting point as possible. It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

It's got a decent outline and is quite informative, including history and timelines. I enjoyed \"Exploring Celtic Druidism\" by Sirona Knight. And if you see how different those two books are, you can imagine how different individual Druids and Druidic groups also are. Someone would also be likely to recommend \"The 21 Lessons of Merlin.\" If you do read it, read it like a legend with bits of inspiration and fact mixed in. It's a rather fun read, but more whimsical than practical, although each appendix after each chapter has some solid stuff. I can't recommend much for the other pagan paths because I haven't read about them as much. I've mostly learned about the other paths directly from people who follow those paths, which really is the best way to learn if you can. I learned Buddhism from a very wise Buddhist man, not a book. The books I read were a supplement. Let me know what you think.",

        "content": "Discussion topic #2: Do what ye will, but harm none. This line is going to be the focus of an entire post here because there's so much to it. It's a Wiccan concept, but is used by many modern pagans even if they aren't Wiccan. I'm Druid, and even I feel that the Wiccan Rede is a valuable rule. If there was a Pagan \"Commandment,\" this would be it. Most people try to claim that this means, \"Do whatever you want, without restraint, as long as you don't physically hurt someone else.\" That interpretation is WRONG. Let's take a look at what \"harm none\" really means. First, what is \"harm\"? Yes, if you steal from someone, physically assault someone, or murder someone, that's harm, of course. But it also causes harm when you insult a person. It causes harm when you release toxic pollutants into the environment which make people sick or contaminate crops. It causes harm when you take more than you need, and others are left with none. It causes harm when you support an organization that perpetuates abuse (overseas sweatshop workers, child labor, unfair wages). It causes harm when you destroy ANYTHING needlessly. It causes harm when you denigrate a person to a sub-human status. It causes harm when you lie to people. It causes harm when you hinder the spiritual path of a person. It causes harm when you make a person feel worthless, and thereby hindering that person's confidence and ability to fully live. In all actions, if you live by the Wiccan Rede, you need to ensure that you are not causing harm to anyone else, whether spiritually, physically, or emotionally. To whom does this apply? EVERYONE. The child working in the sweatshop in Taiwan, the homeless man living under a bridge, your neighbor, your spouse, your children, AND YOU. Yes, \"harm none\" means you can't do harm to yourself either. How can you harm yourself? This isn't just about suicide or inflicting self-injury. While that's included, we're also talking about spiritual and emotional harm. We're talking about your health. If you eat french fries until you weigh 600 pounds, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, type-II diabetes, and can't move except to pick up the phone and order another pizza... you've harmed yourself. (You've also harmed those around you, if you think about it.) If you shut off your mind, never read, and never let yourself grow intellectually, you have done yourself harm. If you shut yourself off from the world and never interact with other people, you do yourself emotional and spiritual harm. You're stunting yourself. When you hurt others, you cause spiritual damage to yourself. In short, this means that whatever choices and actions you make, if you follow the Wiccan Rede, you must be sure that you are not harming yourself or others in any way. Actions must be neutral or positive. When you consider the fact that this can apply to ANY situation and EVERY person or living creature, then it's a very powerful and complex oath to follow.",
