In a \"Sharp Point\" message posted Wednesday on the command\u2019s Web site, USFK commander Gen. Walter Sharp said incidents of sexual assaults, aggravated assaults, assaults and disorderly conduct have increased since the curfew was shortened to two hours beginning Aug. 15. Under the current curfew, troops are required to be indoors from 3 to 5 a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and U.S.-observed holidays. The previous weekend curfew was 1 to 5 a.m. Sharp\u2019s assessment was based on a six-month review of the policy\u2019s impact on troop behavior. \"This is unacceptable and we must act now to correct this trend,\" he said. >http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=61768 Good going troops, keep up the good work to make such a good impression.",

Around 500 Army, and 30+ Air Force. Most of the bar girls were Russian. No problems with crime either. Too bad they closed the base. I would never want to be stationed there again now. With all the smaller base closures, there's too much young testosterone crammed into the bigger bases.",
