He was a Special Forces soldier and a member of the U.S. Army's elite parachute team. The Golden Knights in 1994, a mid-air collision cost him both of his legs. Dana's determination in the Army, and now in the civilian world, has earned him woldwide recognition as a motivational speaker and skydiver demonstrator. I have over 30 pix, trying to get them on here too. It will take me a while, lol. Joseph L. Galloway, author of \"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\" was there and Dennis got his autograph. It was a bitter/sweet day for all the Vietnam Vets. 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpLbtT88By8 This message has been edited. Last edited by: RetiredMarineWife, Mon 01 June 2009 10:29 AM",
