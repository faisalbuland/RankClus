There is nothing more annoying than some yacking-azz dog and it's the dog's owner's responsibility to maintain his animal in the proper manner. Most towns have animal and noise ordinances. The animal barking statutes are usually not handled by the police, but by the dog warden or animal control officer. They know the statutes better than cops and are entrusted to summons dog owners for violations. Our statute prohibits \"prolonged barking\". A court ruling said prolonged exceeded 15 or 20 minutes. The animal control officer also will see if the dog is licensed. Unlicensed would be another violation. If summonses go unanswered, I have seen them confiscate an animal till the situation is resolved. They have asked for evidence, such as a video of the violation. Your information will be kept confidential because they know most complainants don't want a confrontation with a knucklehead dog owner. By all means call animal control soon. Tell them your friend Kevin told you to.",

There is nothing more annoying than some yacking-azz dog and it's the dog's owner's responsibility to maintain his animal in the proper manner. Most towns have animal and noise ordinances. The animal barking statutes are usually not handled by the police, but by the dog warden or animal control officer. They know the statutes better than cops and are entrusted to summons dog owners for violations. Our statute prohibits \"prolonged barking\". A court ruling said prolonged exceeded 15 or 20 minutes. The animal control officer also will see if the dog is licensed. Unlicensed would be another violation. If summonses go unanswered, I have seen them confiscate an animal till the situation is resolved. They have asked for evidence, such as a video of the violation. Your information will be kept confidential because they know most complainants don't want a confrontation with a knucklehead dog owner. By all means call animal control soon. Tell them your friend Kevin told you to.",

You will have to submit evidence of the annoying barking. When the court grants the order, any subsequent barking will be a violation of the court order, ie, contempt of court, and the neighbor will be fined. If it continues, after about three violations, the court will order the dog removed by animal control. You do not need a lawyer to do this. It is just a matter of filling out the forms and appearing in court. The sheriff can serve the neighbor with the notice to appear.",
