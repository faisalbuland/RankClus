A stray had a litter in one of my storage sheds, and either a dog or another cat got in there and ate them all. We found lots of tails and paws, and a whole lot of blood. But then there was this one. Somehow, it escaped the fate of the others. Camy and I rescued it, and every 2 hours I would wake up and feed it through the night and wipe its little butt with a warm Q-tip per the PetsMart suggestions. It survived a week, but one morning I woke up and it was dead. No idea why. It was just too young to survive without the mom, I guess. I was 34. And when I found it dead in its little box, I cried so hard that my oldest daughter, Danielle, rocked me back and forth as she held me. I didn't care what anyone thought - I still don't. That little kitten survived a week, and I still sweat in the eyes thinking about it. It was the most innocent, precious thing ever.
