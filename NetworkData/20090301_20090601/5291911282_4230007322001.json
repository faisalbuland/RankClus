It might be better and cheaper to buy one this year than to wait a few years since this new law passed by Obama on cars getting 35.5 mpg will cost on average $1300.00 more in a few years. The battery pack on a hybrid is under warranty for 100,000 and to replace one on a Toyota will set you back about $3,000.00 including labor. However, I usually trade in a car once I get about 50,000 miles on it so I don't have to worry about items like that. Not to mention I get a better trade in price the less miles on the car. Gas prices will never go down until we the people start waking up and buy smarter, smaller, and greener. Look up the Toyota Prius in Consumer Reports and you will notice it is listed as the best selling hybrid and has the best customer satisfaction rating of any hybrid sold in the US. I'm buying one late this summer.",
