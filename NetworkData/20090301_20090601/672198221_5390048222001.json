There will always be some sort of a low-level insurgency in Iraq for the next five, 10, 15 years,\" said Gen. Raymond Odierno. \"The issue is, what is the level of that insurgency and can the Iraqis handle it with their own forces and with their government.\" While there is still an insurgency, it can be hard to tell the difference between insurgents and criminals, Odierno said during a news conference. \"It\u2019s getting harder and harder to lump them into groups, because what you have is you have people who just conduct things for money,\" he said. Combat operations in Iraq are slated to end in 2010, after which a force of between 35,000 and 50,000 U.S. troops will remain, Odierno said. All U.S. troops are slated to leave Iraq by the end of 2011 under a security agreement between the two countries. Overall, security trends in Iraq are positive, but a string of suicide bombings in the past few weeks show that the situation remains fragile, Odierno said. The Iraqis still need to reach solutions on a number of hot-button issues. More at (*http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=62587*)",
