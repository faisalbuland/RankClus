Please remember that To Free The Oppressed It's about time that something like this has formed. I'm an E7 in the Army National Guard (Colorado, B co. 5/19th SFG) I'm an 18C and I'm getting the hell out of the Army. I've had enough. I ETS in October and I'm picking up my family and we're moving to New Hampshire to join other defenders of the Republic in a place that is still one of the freest places in the nation. (I'm a member of the Free State Project.) I'm currently serving on OWT status at Ft. Bliss, TX. I wanted to share what is going on here. Bliss is mandating that all soldiers who own POWs (privately owned weapons) cannot store their firearms on post housing. They must be turned into the arms room. All soldiers must register any weapons they own with the provost marshall regardless of whether or not they live on post. Further, the post commander has mandated that if soldiers do not comply, they will face courts martial. The counseling statement I recieved on this new policy stated that privately owned firearms are a serious threat to the safety of the community. I kid you not. Here it is: they're now figuring out who in the military is a firearms owner as a pretext to disarming these soldiers first before going after everyone else's guns. I'm completely on board with your statements of intent, but I will uphold these edicts from outside the military. I'm not going to be ordered at gunpoint to participate in the fascist takeover of this country. BTW; I discovered your site via Alex Jones. You have permission to use this email in your efforts to get the word out and let me know how I can assist. ( I won't post the SFC's name, but you can check it out at the site I listed above.)

After 3 months and my wife arriving, I got an apartment on the economy and stayed there for two years, while guys were cutting each other up with knives and straight razors on post on an all too regular basis... It was CRAZY. What was even crazier was that not a bit of it ever showed up in the papers stateside -- I was in USN from 71-75 and I remember some tense times at couple of places I was stationed. People getting sucker punched for just passing thru a group of guys in the passageway. Some real racial tension at times. Just to enlighten my own ignorance. I'm not familar with the term \"Diesel Head\" Never heard that used in the Navy",

(I'm a member of the Free State Project.) I'm currently serving on OWT status at Ft. Bliss, TX. I wanted to share what is going on here. Bliss is mandating that all soldiers who own POWs (privately owned weapons) cannot store their firearms on post housing. They must be turned into the arms room. All soldiers must register any weapons they own with the provost marshall regardless of whether or not they live on post. Further, the post commander has mandated that if soldiers do not comply, they will face courts martial. The counseling statement I recieved on this new policy stated that privately owned firearms are a serious threat to the safety of the community. I kid you not. Here it is: they're now figuring out who in the military is a firearms owner as a pretext to disarming these soldiers first before going after everyone else's guns. I'm completely on board with your statements of intent, but I will uphold these edicts from outside the military. I'm not going to be ordered at gunpoint to participate in the fascist takeover of this country. BTW; I discovered your site via Alex Jones.

When I was stationed in W.Germany from 1984-1986.I had a replica of a sword I had gotten in Spain. I was told I had to put that in the arms room, it was considered a weapon. I don't know where or who this person is, but they need to find their way back to reality, and soon. Is this legal? I don't know,but its fun isn't?!",
