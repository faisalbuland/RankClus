Militants locked up courthouses and seized court documents in the district of Buner, said police Superintendent Arsala Khan. However, a highly placed Buner official said the judges left voluntarily after meeting with Taliban leaders. A van carrying Frontier Corps paramilitary troops through the district came under fire Thursday. One police official was killed and another wounded, authorities said. The troops were sent to protect civilians and properties, said Maj. Gen Athar Abbas, spokesman for Pakistan's military. (...) The militant group's leaders met with community elders and the civilian administration Thursday and agreed that its members will not move about openly with guns nor will they disturb police, courts, schools, hospitals or non-governmental organizations. The takeover of Buner brings the Taliban closer to the capital, Islamabad, than it has been since the insurgency started. The Taliban commander in Buner, Mowlana Mohammed Khalil, gave a statement before Pakistani television cameras Wednesday, appearing with his face hidden behind a cloth mask. Watch as Taliban is emboldened \u00bb \"We came here only to preach Islam,\" Khalil said. He added that his fighters were carrying weapons only because they were an important symbol for Muslims. The militants said they took control of the Buner district to ensure that Islamic law, or sharia, was properly imposed. The Pakistani government called the advance into the district a breach of a recently signed peace agreement. Residents of Buner said the militants had set up checkpoints and were patrolling streets throughout the district. (...) On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Pakistan was in danger of falling into terrorist hands because of failed government policies, and called on Pakistani citizens and expatriates to voice more concern. (...) Mike Mullen, U.S. chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was in Islamabad on Wednesday to meet with Pakistani officials. Taliban militants implemented Islamic law in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley last week, before taking control of the neighboring Buner district. But Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, told CNN on Wednesday that the situation was not as dire as Clinton described. (...) Taliban fighters moved into the Swat Valley as part of a peace deal with the government that has come under fire from U.S. observers. But Haqqani compared it to the deals U.S. commanders in Iraq made to peel insurgents away from Islamic jihadists blamed for the worst attacks on civilians there. (...)",
