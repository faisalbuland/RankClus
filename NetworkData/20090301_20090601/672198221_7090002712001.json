Now, thanks to an Internet marketing campaign and unlikely allies, Edwards has become the human face of homelessness to thousands of online viewers drawn to his website by its deliberately controversial name - Pimp This Bum. [I removed the website link to comply with site rules but you can probably guess the website name] During regular webcasts, dozens of visitors to ask questions about Edwards' life and his slow fall from office manager with a home, a car, and a future to an outcast short of hope and with little prospect of help. The site also is a venue where visitors can donate money, services and goods to help Edwards yank himself out of homelessness. Some homeless advocates say it makes Edwards a victim of exploitation, but the organizers say that edgy tone is what makes the project succeed. \"We wanted to insult people's sensitivities so that they would go to the site and see Tim, and people seem to have fallen in love with him. He's funny and doesn't blame the world for his situation,\" said Kevin Dolan, 55, a marketing specialist from the Houston suburb of Katy who started the website with his 24-year-old son, Sean. If the site had been called \"Help the Homeless,\" many Web surfers might just have clicked on past, says Sean. The Dolans had initially set out to test an advertising campaign and generate publicity for their new Internet marketing business. They planned to promote a mom-and-pop business, until Sean suggested using the website to do some good. Now visitors to the site are getting to know Edwards beyond the stereotype of an anonymous group labelled \"The Homeless.\" \"I'm the world's first online bum,\" jokes Edwards, a lanky, bearded 37-year-old who talks about life on the streets with a mix of dark humour and unvarnished honesty. \"The whole idea of this project is to get people off the street. I'm the pioneer, but I've got friends behind me. If I don't get this right, it ain't gonna work for them.\" The website features videos of Edwards and a photograph showing him with a hand-drawn, cardboard sign. There's a \"Donate\" button where viewers can charge donations to their credit card. And some people have dropped by Edwards' regular panhandling spot to drop off food and fast-food gift cards - or just to shout hello. This coming week, Edwards is scheduled to enter an alcohol detox program at the Seattle-based Sunray Treatment and Recovery, which is providing the $13,800, 35-day program free of charge. There are plans to air webcasts as Edwards goes through the program. On Monday, in preparation for his trip to Seattle and his entry into rehab at Sunray, Edwards plans to shave his beard and trim his hair - a symbolic nod to the start of a new life. It will be broadcast live on the website. Some homeless advocates say the website does little to address the underlying issues of homelessness. Even the name makes Anthony Love bristle. \"He is a person. His name is Tim. And to pimp anyone is not something I would endorse,\" said Love, president of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County. At first, Edwards wasn't sure if the Dolans were a threat or just do-gooders bringing food. Now he considers them an answer to a prayer. \"I asked God to make it rain and here come these guys. And I thought this is just crazy enough to work,\" he said.",
