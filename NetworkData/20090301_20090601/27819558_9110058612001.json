Having the right minds in the right place at the right time can bring about the expected, one would hope. Obama's team can organize that, I would think, to give a favorable nod to the powers that be that total unabridged removal of the DA/DT law needs to be forthcoming.

We want to get it done once and for all,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have to create an atmosphere, create an environment in which we will win.\u201d \u201cWe want to win.

Ellen Tauscher, again, has taken the lead on this. Marty Meehan was our guy, and he\u2019s gone now. Ellen is\u2026 but she\u2019s always worked on the issue. It\u2019s a priority for us, and we\u2019ll bring it to the floor when we think that we can win it. And also win it in the Senate. But we will, again, be working to create that atmosphere. Now I work with Barney [Frank] and Tammy Baldwin on these issues, and now we welcome Jared Polis to taking lead on some of these. Not that other members don\u2019t participate, but those members take special ownership of those issues. The priorities have been hate crimes and ENDA. Fully inclusive legislation in those two areas. So we\u2019ll have to have our strategy work around how we can have those passed, as well as move forward on the 'don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,' which now, has become almost self-evident that the American people want us to have the best possible defense. Colin Powel, Sam Nunn, some of the people who might have before\u2026been allies at least [are now] saying that we should review the policy. \"Some of these things are the tail of the tadpole -- they\u2019re remnant of another piece of evolution.
