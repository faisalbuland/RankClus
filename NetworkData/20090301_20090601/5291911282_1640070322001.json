She called to tell us we would have to be guest of her mother that weekend, because as a CW3 her grandmother and I would only as one of the spectators. However, VIP status would be given to her mother, NOT because she is the mother of a graduate, but because she\u2019s an E9. E9 and O6s and above are granted VIP status. I guess my daughter has been right all the time \u2013 E9s do out rank W3s. I feel like Rodney Dangerfield, I don\u2019t get any respect at all. Life is good when you are a grandfather. God and the soldier, All men adore, In time of trouble, And no more; For when war is over, And all things righted, God is neglected - The old soldier slighted.
