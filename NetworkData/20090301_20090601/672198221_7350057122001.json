The swine flu virus routinely causes outbreaks in pigs but doesn't usually kill many of them. Q Can people get swine flu? A Swine flu viruses don't usually infect humans. There have been occasional cases, usually among people who've had direct contact with infected pigs, such as farmworkers. Q Can it spread among humans? A There have been cases of the virus spreading from human to human, probably in the same way as seasonal flu, through coughing and sneezing by infected people. Q What are the symptoms of swine flu? A The symptoms are similar to those of regular flu -- fever, cough, fatigue, lack of appetite. Q Are there drugs to treat swine flu in humans? A Four different drugs are approved in the U.S. to treat the flu, but the new virus has shown resistance to the two oldest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. Q Does a regular flu shot protect against swine flu? A The seasonal flu vaccine used in the U.S. this year is not likely to protect against the latest swine flu virus. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The swine flu virus routinely causes outbreaks in pigs but doesn't usually kill many of them. Q Can people get swine flu? A Swine flu viruses don't usually infect humans. There have been occasional cases, usually among people who've had direct contact with infected pigs, such as farmworkers. Q Can it spread among humans? A There have been cases of the virus spreading from human to human, probably in the same way as seasonal flu, through coughing and sneezing by infected people. Q What are the symptoms of swine flu? A The symptoms are similar to those of regular flu -- fever, cough, fatigue, lack of appetite. Q Are there drugs to treat swine flu in humans? A Four different drugs are approved in the U.S. to treat the flu, but the new virus has shown resistance to the two oldest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. Q Does a regular flu shot protect against swine flu? A The seasonal flu vaccine used in the U.S. this year is not likely to protect against the latest swine flu virus. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In Mexico, 68 people have died from swine flu, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.

The swine flu virus routinely causes outbreaks in pigs but doesn't usually kill many of them. Q Can people get swine flu? A Swine flu viruses don't usually infect humans. There have been occasional cases, usually among people who've had direct contact with infected pigs, such as farmworkers. Q Can it spread among humans? A There have been cases of the virus spreading from human to human, probably in the same way as seasonal flu, through coughing and sneezing by infected people. Q What are the symptoms of swine flu? A The symptoms are similar to those of regular flu -- fever, cough, fatigue, lack of appetite. Q Are there drugs to treat swine flu in humans? A Four different drugs are approved in the U.S. to treat the flu, but the new virus has shown resistance to the two oldest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. Q Does a regular flu shot protect against swine flu? A The seasonal flu vaccine used in the U.S. this year is not likely to protect against the latest swine flu virus. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
