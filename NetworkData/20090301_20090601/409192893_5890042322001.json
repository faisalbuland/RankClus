Regarding religion, I have no feelings about it one way or the other but would support taxing church assets as there is no logical reason to not do so. Yes, quite right, there is NO evidence proving that it\u2019s a choice. Of course, there\u2019s NO evidence showing that left or right handedness is anything but choice either. But we know that it\u2019s not, they just haven\u2019t identified the mechanism yet. It\u2019s the same with sexual orientation: far more evidence points to its being hardwired in rather than a choice, but they haven\u2019t identified the triggering mechanism yet. What is up with the childish header and other drama? When you decide to grow up and post like an adult we can have a discussion. Until that happens consider yourself scraped from the bottom of my shoe.

Many in the Gay community don't condone the behavior that some of the youngsters were displaying after Prop 8 passed in California but personally I thought those protesters were rather mild, no rioting in the streets with shops being looted or burned to the ground, no police cars turned upside down and set afire or physical attacks on unsuspecting passersby. On the other hand, I don't believe such activism does much good other than further galvanize and entrenchment both sides in this struggle.

Down Syndrome, Autism/Savant, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Tourette Syndrome all exist and scientist don't know what causes them. We shouldn't deny people equality just because we don't have scientific proof of why they are different. There is no link that would suggest a person is homophobic just because they don't support Gay friendly legislation. Personally, I think many people don't support Gay Legislation because they are jealous of our spectacular, colorful, and marvelous personalities!!! There are also many, such as me, who were far more supportive of gay rights prior to all the demonstrations and activism against Proposition 8. The rancor and hatred being hacked up by the gay rights movement tends more to alienate than it does to attract supporters. I find many gay leaders to be intolerant and absolutely offensive and while their antics may not change my vote I will never under any circumstance allow myself to be aligned with such vile hate spewing malcontents.", 
        "reply": " Those folks were just practicing their Freedom of Speech and right to peacefully assemble and protest. Many in the Gay community don't condone the behavior that some of the youngsters were displaying after Prop 8 passed in California but personally I thought those protesters were rather mild, no rioting in the streets with shops being looted or burned to the ground, no police cars turned upside down and set afire or physical attacks on unsuspecting passersby. On the other hand, I don't believe such activism does much good other than further galvanize and entrenchment both sides in this struggle. The fight will be won thru Legislation and the Court system.",

Yes, quite right, there is NO evidence proving that it\u2019s a choice. Of course, there\u2019s NO evidence showing that left or right handedness is anything but choice either. But we know that it\u2019s not, they just haven\u2019t identified the mechanism yet. It\u2019s the same with sexual orientation: far more evidence points to its being hardwired in rather than a choice, but they haven\u2019t identified the triggering mechanism yet. What is up with the childish header and other drama? When you decide to grow up and post like an adult we can have a discussion. Until that happens consider yourself scraped from the bottom of my shoe.
