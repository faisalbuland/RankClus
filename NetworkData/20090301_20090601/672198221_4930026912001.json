As a brand spanking new Naval Aviator/Helicopter Pilot fresh from flight school in 1983, I remember checking into (then) HMT-204 and hearing all about the revolutionary new aircraft the Corps was building to replace the ancient Phrogs (CH-46). It used to scare the crap out of me to hear the then XO of the squadron talk about the latest and greatest news. He'd mention things like \"they're able to knock some additional weight off the design (it was grossly overweight initially) through use of a glue they developed that will replace rivets.\" Then there's the \"Blottle.\" Don't even get me started on that one. When I retired in 2001, the Osprey still hadn't been placed in operation. I hope to God we're now getting our money's worth. I've no doubt that it will now start to prove its airworthiness and utility. I'm just not convinced, nor was I ever, that the cost (and time) were worth it. There's no question that we desperately needed replacements for our medium lift assets. I just never believed the Osprey was the answer. Unfortunately, we sunk so much money and effort into it over the years that we really had no choice but to continue down this path since there were no other competitors waiting in the wings.",

The OV-10 Bronco Recon aircraft also flew from our deck, as well as many other helos; UH-1Ns, AH-1Ts, CH-46s and -47s, CH-53 Sea Stallions, SH-60Cs, etc. We build all these costly things, and some boneheaded, overpaid, degreed knumbskull(s) decide to decomm and SINK the USS Belleau Wood in the 'mid-stride' of its useful life! This kind of idiocy is so inexplicable and most perplexing to me...how can they JUSTIFY doing this...the ship cannot yield a return on the investment of the American People when it is resting on the sea bottom off Hawaii, sunk as a \"reef\" for fish?! 40,000-plus tons of very expensive steel and aluminum, stainless steel, monel and any number of other metals, and the loss of a viable, working ship that, to build today, would cost TWICE as much or more than the USS Belleau Wood did when it was built, 1973-1978. The V-22 Osprey has been a struggle to design, build and FLY successfully...it defies many principles of flight, much like the Harrier jump-jet. The vulnerability of the V-22 seems to be the 'transition' phase between the vertical liftoff and horizontal forward flight. The vertical downwash from the rotors has to be converted to thrust for forward motion...I'd like to see a smoke-flow demo of the air all around the wings and rotors as the heavy V-22 lifts off vertically and transitions to forward flight. I'll bet there are some mean vortexes and weird airflow patterns throughout the t/o process. Wind shear can be a real bummer with HIGE/HOGE aircraft like Harriers, helos and V-22s! What is the crosswind component of these? One engine failure at t/o or landing just before or during the tilt-wing transition, or any kind of a mechanical failure of the wing tilt/rotation mechanism...not pretty, I'm sure. That's not something you just crank or pump manually like a landing gear failure. It's a complex system. I'm a bit more traditional in flying machinery I like...you're already up there defying gravity as it is in a basic bird!",
