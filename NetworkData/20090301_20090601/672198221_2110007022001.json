Weather reports--two different ones, featuring full-length camera shots of two different, very attractive female weather reporters. Tax day tomorrow (along with the teabagging stories). Okay! They just now (21 minutes after the speech) got around to it. Their coverage is tied in to a tax day/tea bag story, and consists of a telephone interview with Hannity. Oh, now they're off of that topic. What do they want to talk about now? Kooky astronaut Lisa Nowak. Now THERE'S important news. I fully expect his speech will be the major topic on some upcoming FNC programs, but only after they've had time to spin it. I mention this because I want to caution you.

In a speech at Georgetown University, Obama delivered \"prose, not poetry,\" aimed at crystallizing why this recession differed from previous ones. Obama blamed greed and irresponsibility, not a normal downturn in the business cycle, for the current recession, and defended his administration's aggressive actions to tackle it. \"There is no doubt that times are still tough,\" Obama said. \"But from where we stand,\" he said, \"for the very first time, we are beginning to see glimmers of hope. And beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past.\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

Whether we agree or disagree, we can't deny it's important news. However, I'm currently flipping among the three 24-hour news channels (CNN, FOX, MSNBC). If I were only watching Fox News, I would never know this speech had just happened. CNN and MSNBC are still (15 minutes after the speech) analyzing it. CNN just interviewed a dissenting voice (Ron Paul) concerning the speech. What is Fox News talking about? Immediately after the speech, about 4-5 minutes of commercials. Pirate hostage Richard Phillips comes home tomorrow. The plane that was landed by a passenger (who was also a pilot, as it turns out). Weather reports--two different ones, featuring full-length camera shots of two different, very attractive female weather reporters. Tax day tomorrow (along with the teabagging stories). Okay! They just now (21 minutes after the speech) got around to it. Their coverage is tied in to a tax day/tea bag story, and consists of a telephone interview with Hannity. Oh, now they're off of that topic. What do they want to talk about now? Kooky astronaut Lisa Nowak. Now THERE'S important news. I fully expect his speech will be the major topic on some upcoming FNC programs, but only after they've had time to spin it. I mention this because I want to caution you. If all you watch is Fox News Channel, you will not get \"fair and balanced\" coverage of anything that concerns President Obama. I recommend rotating your news viewing. That's the only way you'll really see any \"balance.\"",

If I were only watching Fox News, I would never know this speech had just happened. CNN and MSNBC are still (15 minutes after the speech) analyzing it. CNN just interviewed a dissenting voice (Ron Paul) concerning the speech. You must be watching the other FOX network; the one on my TV showed the speech in its entirety and then went on to other news. The President is an excellent speaker so perhaps those who watch FOX don't require 15 minutes of analysis to comprehend what they just heard. 15 minutes of vapid worshiping commentary....",
