World health authorities worried openly that the strange new virus could become a global epidemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said tests show some of the Mexico victims died from the same new strain of swine flu that sickened eight people in Texas and California. Of the 14 samples tested from Mexico, seven were matches, said the CDC's acting director Dr. Richard Besser. Mexico put the confirmed toll at 20 dead, but 40 other fatalities were being probed, and at least 943 nationwide were sick from the suspected flu, the health department said.

Interesting to see all those Mexicans on the news looking like the Chinese used to. Add this to the crash of Canadian tourist companies and I hope we start taking more passes on the Mayan Riviera. It may not be near Mexico City but it's only 3 hours away by truck or car, Mayans could make it there and back in a day. That leaves 6 to cough all over you.
