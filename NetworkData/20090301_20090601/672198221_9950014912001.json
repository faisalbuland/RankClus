I had much rather be a prisoner of the USA than a prisoner of this Islamic radical fascist. Where are our missing combatants? Where are our missing contractors? Probably dead. Take your liberal agenda back to traffic court! That is where you will do the most good. Please by all means, take a trip at taxpayers expense to Afgahstan or to Iraq, or better yet to the mountains of northwest Pakistan; do field study so that you can better understand the culture of Islamic fascism and their world view especially toward us. Interview released prisoners. Just take an interrupter(that's all you'll need) but by all means tell them who you are; an American judge(demand they show all the digity and respect due of your position). That should make our world safer and their world right.",
