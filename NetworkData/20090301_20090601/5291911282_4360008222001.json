My question is wasn't the only one to be fitted for dress blues was the guide, at least it was when I went to boot camp in 99 which wasn't that long ago. I'm just wondering if she is trying to make it a surprise by not telling anyone. Does anyone know something different??",

Best to get everything a size or two larger - - And that's just for loose fitting clothes. I knew a chap who was joining a cavalry regiment who insisted that his Mess overalls were absolutely skin-tight. Of course this was at RMAS where you're run ragged for 44 weeks and are unusually svelte so while they fitted perfectly for the graduation ball by the time he actually got to his regiment he split 'em at his Dining In. \u00a3500 down the drain.",
