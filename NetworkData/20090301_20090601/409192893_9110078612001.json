Eighty-one percent (81%) of Republican voters disagree and 8% are undecided in a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Democrats, however, are closely divided-- 44% say Limbaugh is the Republican leader and 41% don\u2019t believe it. Among voters not affiliated with either of the major national parties, 27% say Limbaugh is the Republicans\u2019 leader, while 58% say he is not and 15% are undecided.

For this topic, respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, \u201cRush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party. He says jump, and they say how high.\u201d That statement came from Brad Woodhouse, president of the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change. His group is co-sponsoring national television ads with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that link Limbaugh to the GOP. Woodhouse was not identified in the survey. Overall, only 29% of the nation\u2019s voters agree with Woodhouse\u2019s statement. Fifty-nine percent (59%) disagree, and 13% are not sure.

Eighty-one percent (81%) of Republican voters disagree and 8% are undecided in a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Democrats, however, are closely divided-- 44% say Limbaugh is the Republican leader and 41% don\u2019t believe it. Among voters not affiliated with either of the major national parties, 27% say Limbaugh is the Republicans\u2019 leader, while 58% say he is not and 15% are undecided. Rasmussen Reports is testing public reaction to a series of quotes made by newsmakers recently. For this topic, respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, \u201cRush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party. He says jump, and they say how high.\u201d That statement came from Brad Woodhouse, president of the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change. His group is co-sponsoring national television ads with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that link Limbaugh to the GOP. Woodhouse was not identified in the survey. Overall, only 29% of the nation\u2019s voters agree with Woodhouse\u2019s statement. Fifty-nine percent (59%) disagree, and 13% are not sure. Results from other newsmaker quotes will be released in the coming days. (Want a free daily e-mail update? Sign up now. If it's in the news, it's in our polls.) Rasmussen Reports updates also available on Twitter. While Limbaugh is arguably the most high-profile conservative commentator in the country, even 76% of self-designated conservatives do not see him as the Republican leader. Fifty-two percent (52%) of moderates share that view, but the plurality of liberals (45%) do see Limbaugh as calling the shots for the GOP. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday dubbed Limbaugh \"the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party.\" The next day, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs described the popular radio commentator as \"a national spokesperson for conservative views and many in the Republican Party.\" Even President Obama himself got in the act when in January he urged Republican leaders in a private meeting to quit listening to Limbaugh. In earlier posts these people were saying the WH has no hand in this and now they're gloating in it.",

His group is co-sponsoring national television ads with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that link Limbaugh to the GOP. Woodhouse was not identified in the survey. Overall, only 29% of the nation\u2019s voters agree with Woodhouse\u2019s statement. Fifty-nine percent (59%) disagree, and 13% are not sure. Results from other newsmaker quotes will be released in the coming days. (Want a free daily e-mail update? Sign up now. If it's in the news, it's in our polls.) Rasmussen Reports updates also available on Twitter. While Limbaugh is arguably the most high-profile conservative commentator in the country, even 76% of self-designated conservatives do not see him as the Republican leader. Fifty-two percent (52%) of moderates share that view, but the plurality of liberals (45%) do see Limbaugh as calling the shots for the GOP. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday dubbed Limbaugh \"the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party.\" The next day, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs described the popular radio commentator as \"a national spokesperson for conservative views and many in the Republican Party.\" Even President Obama himself got in the act when in January he urged Republican leaders in a private meeting to quit listening to Limbaugh. In earlier posts these people were saying the WH has no hand in this and now they're gloating in it.",

Eighty-one percent (81%) of Republican voters disagree and 8% are undecided in a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey.

Rasmussen Reports is testing public reaction to a series of quotes made by newsmakers recently. For this topic, respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, \u201cRush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party. He says jump, and they say how high.\u201d That statement came from Brad Woodhouse, president of the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change. His group is co-sponsoring national television ads with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that link Limbaugh to the GOP. Woodhouse was not identified in the survey. Overall, only 29% of the nation\u2019s voters agree with Woodhouse\u2019s statement. Fifty-nine percent (59%) disagree, and 13% are not sure. Results from other newsmaker quotes will be released in the coming days. (Want a free daily e-mail update? Sign up now. If it's in the news, it's in our polls.)

While Limbaugh is arguably the most high-profile conservative commentator in the country, even 76% of self-designated conservatives do not see him as the Republican leader. Fifty-two percent (52%) of moderates share that view, but the plurality of liberals (45%) do see Limbaugh as calling the shots for the GOP. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday dubbed Limbaugh \"the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party.\" The next day, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs described the popular radio commentator as \"a national spokesperson for conservative views and many in the Republican Party.\" Even President Obama himself got in the act when in January he urged Republican leaders in a private meeting to quit listening to Limbaugh.

Eighty-one percent (81%) of Republican voters disagree and 8% are undecided in a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Democrats, however, are closely divided-- 44% say Limbaugh is the Republican leader and 41% don\u2019t believe it. Among voters not affiliated with either of the major national parties, 27% say Limbaugh is the Republicans\u2019 leader, while 58% say he is not and 15% are undecided. Rasmussen Reports is testing public reaction to a series of quotes made by newsmakers recently. For this topic, respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, \u201cRush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party. He says jump, and they say how high.\u201d That statement came from Brad Woodhouse, president of the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change. His group is co-sponsoring national television ads with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that link Limbaugh to the GOP. Woodhouse was not identified in the survey. Overall, only 29% of the nation\u2019s voters agree with Woodhouse\u2019s statement. Fifty-nine percent (59%) disagree, and 13% are not sure. Results from other newsmaker quotes will be released in the coming days. (Want a free daily e-mail update? Sign up now. If it's in the news, it's in our polls.) Rasmussen Reports updates also available on Twitter. While Limbaugh is arguably the most high-profile conservative commentator in the country, even 76% of self-designated conservatives do not see him as the Republican leader. Fifty-two percent (52%) of moderates share that view, but the plurality of liberals (45%) do see Limbaugh as calling the shots for the GOP. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday dubbed Limbaugh \"the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party.\" The next day, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs described the popular radio commentator as \"a national spokesperson for conservative views and many in the Republican Party.\" Even President Obama himself got in the act when in January he urged Republican leaders in a private meeting to quit listening to Limbaugh.

That's what our Republic was founded on, right, FrJohn?",
