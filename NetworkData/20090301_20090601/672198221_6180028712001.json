Once tax season hit, Ed Barnett was feeling sour. After simmering for a few weeks, he poured his frustrations into a letter to the Wichita Falls (Texas) Times Record News, which was published Feb. 6. In it, the Wichita Falls native and former Times Record News staffer apologized to the Internal Revenue Service for his inability to pay income taxes this year. \"I don't think people realize all the taxes we pay every day,\" Barnett said. \"The letter wasn't meant to be a public service, but I think people are tired of the irresponsibility of Congress.\" The nation's taxpayers seem to appreciate Barnett's cool sense of humor and playful jabs at government officials -- newspapers from Dallas to Florida have run his now-famous work. He's received calls from Arizona and Rhode Island for permission to share his letter. It's been forwarded back to his e-mail account multiple times from friends and family. \"It's pretty wild,\" Barnett said. \"I'm sure it's going to get me audited! I had no idea this was going to happen.\" While he's new to such widespread recognition and acclaim, this isn't Barnett's first letter to the paper, and it certainly won't be his last. \"I've already got another one cooking,\" he said. \"It has to do with the handful of people making the nation's decisions. I'm like Reagan, I don't think government is the answer. It's the problem.\" Here is the letter that is circulating. Dear IRS, I am sorry to inform you that I will not be able to pay taxes owed April 15, but all is not lost. I have paid these taxes: accounts receivable tax, building permit tax, CDL tax, cigarette tax, corporate income tax, dog license tax, federal income tax, unemployment tax, gasoline tax, hunting license tax, fishing license tax, waterfowl stamp tax, inheritance tax, inventory tax, liquor tax, Luxury tax, Medicare tax, city, school and county property tax (up 33 percent last 4 years), real estate tax, social security tax, road usage tax, toll road tax, state and city sales tax, recreational vehicle tax, state franchise tax, state unemployment tax, telephone federal excise tax, telephone Federal state and local surcharge tax, telephone minimum usage surcharge tax, telephone state and local tax, utility tax, vehicle license registration tax, capitol gains tax, lease severance tax, oil and gas assessment tax, Colorado property tax, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma and New Mexico sales tax, and many more that I can't recall but I have run out of space and money. When you do not receive my check April 15, just know that it is an honest mistake. Please treat me the same way you treated Congressmen Charles Rangel, Chris Dodd, Barney Frank and ex-Congressman Tom Daschle and, of course, your boss Timothy Geithner. No penalties and no interest. P.S. I will make at least a partial payment as soon as I get my stimulus check.

Dave May I ask why? Essentially this is a sales tax, with a refund (charity) to the poor. It is being sold on the basis that since present tax schemes are subject to loopholes, this \"fair tax\" would eliminate these loopholes, and actually collect more revenue.

But I found this and I agree with it completly. Trust me I do not want to see the rich make out like they have been any more than you do. But they do make out now under the current system. It would be kind of hard to explain why someone bought 5 new mercades bentz for company use. Either way..here's the text. \"This may take two posts to correct some non factual claims. You said, \u201cThe so-called \u201cfairtax\u201d scheme would actually be VERY regressive on income (because as income goes up, the percentage of consumption goes down)\u201c. This is simply wrong. The rich today hide their money, or pay 15% taxes as they will find a way to use their cap gains as income streams. Also, since the rich buy bigger and better, they will be paying much more in taxes than they do now-it can\u2019t be hidden. next, you claim \u201cInstead, the sales tax rate, according to \u201cfairtax\u201d, would go up - AT FIRST - to 23%. And this is just the FEDERAL rate. There are still those State & local additions, where applicable, to the federal sales tax that already exist. These additions could add another 7% or so. That means effectively when you buy $50 worth of food, you would have to pay out, at that moment, an additional $15 in taxes\u201d. This one is funny. You are paying all that NOW. You are also paying excise, cap gains, dividend taxes, death taxes, and oh yeah, the retail price you pay NOW has a built in tax compliance cost for every company along the supply chain who made it possible for you to buy that item. That has been estimated to be anywhere from 10-23% depending upon industry. Think the poor are not getting screwed now? A $100 pair of shoes has $22 of that in the form of all the business taxes paid by all companies up the line. Since this comes out as there will be no income and corporate taxes, the price will NOT go up 23%. Besides, you didn\u2019t bother telling people that instead of getting their tax deductions once a year after having to pay HR Block $200 for the privilidge, you get a prebate check the first each month based on family size. A \u201cpoor\u201d family of four will get $427 per month plus a higher paycheck since payroll taxes are not coming out. Don\u2019t recall you mentioning that. Thirdly, you claim \u201cAlso under the H.R. 25 scam, the States would collect these taxes and then give to the American government whatever amount they claimed - no central managing supervision to verify honesty permitted - to be \u2018correct\u2019 & \u2018fair\u2019\u201c. This is already set up now. Forty-five states have a sales tax and there are no problems collecting. It is just one extra line on the bottom of the form telling the state taxing authority how much to send to the Treasury. You seem to be big on the Constitution. That part about taxes also originally stated that the STATES will collect taxes in proportion to its population and send to the Treasury. HHHMMM, seems the Fair Tax is actually getting back to the way it was intended. Finally, thank God, you stated \u201cNevertheless, under the scam, the total amount of taxes collected from the huge sales tax rate increase, etc. would STILL not be enough to replace the amount collected currently as income taxes. So Americans would be faced immediately with yet almost unimaginally higher increases to the national debt or even alarming.\u201c As compared to NOW? Correct me if I am wrong, but we are going to have a $2 TRILLION deficit this year!!!!!!!!! Forget that, the claim you make is factually wrong. The 23% is revenue neutral and will bring in the same amount as is brought in now. As my background is in Economics, I can assure you victory423, the problem is SPENDING, not revenue generated. So please, at least understand the Fair Tax as a tax collection policy before you disiminate bad information to the public. Thank you, Shannon, Georgia\" I don't know about you Dave. But something has to give and I am willing to step out for this and give it a try. I figure we do not have anything to loose and allot more to gain, specialy if this brings good paying jobs and money back in to this country. I would rather have a good paying job and pay on the fair tax, than no job and trying to get the government to support me, which cost all us tax payers money as well. I think this is the only solution this country has left before the economic world turns it's back on us for good and we are left high and dry. We have nothing in this nation that is solid and bread from the womb of American as you may know...but this pet, sure would be and do us good until American once again stands strong together and not allow the companies to rule us out of fredom and liberty and the basic desire to want to live a decent life and raise a decent family.",

You are also paying excise, cap gains, dividend taxes, death taxes, and oh yeah, the retail price you pay NOW has a built in tax compliance cost for every company along the supply chain who made it possible for you to buy that item. That has been estimated to be anywhere from 10-23% depending upon industry. Think the poor are not getting screwed now? A $100 pair of shoes has $22 of that in the form of all the business taxes paid by all companies up the line. Since this comes out as there will be no income and corporate taxes, the price will NOT go up 23%. Besides, you didn\u2019t bother telling people that instead of getting their tax deductions once a year after having to pay HR Block $200 for the privilidge, you get a prebate check the first each month based on family size. A \u201cpoor\u201d family of four will get $427 per month plus a higher paycheck since payroll taxes are not coming out. Don\u2019t recall you mentioning that. Thirdly, you claim \u201cAlso under the H.R. 25 scam, the States would collect these taxes and then give to the American government whatever amount they claimed - no central managing supervision to verify honesty permitted - to be \u2018correct\u2019 & \u2018fair\u2019\u201c. This is already set up now. Forty-five states have a sales tax and there are no problems collecting. It is just one extra line on the bottom of the form telling the state taxing authority how much to send to the Treasury. You seem to be big on the Constitution. That part about taxes also originally stated that the STATES will collect taxes in proportion to its population and send to the Treasury. HHHMMM, seems the Fair Tax is actually getting back to the way it was intended. Finally, thank God, you stated \u201cNevertheless, under the scam, the total amount of taxes collected from the huge sales tax rate increase, etc. would STILL not be enough to replace the amount collected currently as income taxes. So Americans would be faced immediately with yet almost unimaginally higher increases to the national debt or even alarming.\u201c As compared to NOW? Correct me if I am wrong, but we are going to have a $2 TRILLION deficit this year!!!!!!!!! Forget that, the claim you make is factually wrong. The 23% is revenue neutral and will bring in the same amount as is brought in now. As my background is in Economics, I can assure you victory423, the problem is SPENDING, not revenue generated. So please, at least understand the Fair Tax as a tax collection policy before you disiminate bad information to the public. Thank you, Shannon, Georgia\" I don't know about you Dave. But something has to give and I am willing to step out for this and give it a try. I figure we do not have anything to loose and allot more to gain, specialy if this brings good paying jobs and money back in to this country. I would rather have a good paying job and pay on the fair tax, than no job and trying to get the government to support me, which cost all us tax payers money as well. I think this is the only solution this country has left before the economic world turns it's back on us for good and we are left high and dry. We have nothing in this nation that is solid and bread from the womb of American as you may know...but this pet, sure would be and do us good until American once again stands strong together and not allow the companies to rule us out of fredom and liberty and the basic desire to want to live a decent life and raise a decent family. ....excellent posting....thx Already past the future",

What do you think did you read the plan? My apology for making fun of your numerous mentions of this. Since you believe this is a totally correct solution, and you want this to get out to the public - You are perfectly correct. My apology and my bad. Yes, I read the plan, and no, I don't buy it. Dave May I ask why? Essentially this is a sales tax, with a refund (charity) to the poor. It is being sold on the basis that since present tax schemes are subject to loopholes, this \"fair tax\" would eliminate these loopholes, and actually collect more revenue. The wealthy have indeed managed to create loopholes, and I don't see this kind of tax as being loophole free. I personally know some wealthy people who basically buy very little. They have \"homes\" and \"vehicles\" owned by their corporations. They fly everywhere they want to go on \"business trips.\" I believe that a sales tax is inherently regressive. This plan seeks to address this by these refunds, without realising that it would be far easier to simply close existing loopholes than to create a new scheme out of the air. Nor do I believe that this scheme could ever collect enough funds to meet the needs of the 21st Century. But once in place, and the above is realised, the percent of the tax would simply go up, eliminating the shortage of revenue, but placing a greater and greater burden on the Middle Class and working people. Why is it that these \"Fair taxes\" and \"Flat taxes\" are always proposed by the wealthy and opposed by working people? Could it be that leftist economists are so stupid as to oppose something which gives them a smaller tax? Are they so ideologically driven that they are prepared to cut off their nose to spite their face? On it's face, I will pay less Federal tax. But to my mind this will reflect a steep drop in Federal programs which whether I know or or not, directly benefit me. If these programs are continued by the States - Whose going to pay for them? It's sort of the bind in which New York is facing now. \"Save the subway fare,\" by jacking up the cost of tolls, the sales tax, taxing sodas etc, etc. So these proposed taxes are fair taxes as well. So what if I have to pay an additional $1200 a year in tolls (fortunately I don't drink soda)? The wealthy will have to pay the same amount???? A progressive income tax, coupled with a tax on corporations will be much easier to eliminate loop holes from than this tax. But supposedly that's \"Class warfare.\" Dave These are not my words. But I found this and I agree with it completly. Trust me I do not want to see the rich make out like they have been any more than you do. But they do make out now under the current system. It would be kind of hard to explain why someone bought 5 new mercades bentz for company use. Either way..here's the text. \"This may take two posts to correct some non factual claims. You said, \u201cThe so-called \u201cfairtax\u201d scheme would actually be VERY regressive on income (because as income goes up, the percentage of consumption goes down)\u201c. This is simply wrong. The rich today hide their money, or pay 15% taxes as they will find a way to use their cap gains as income streams. Also, since the rich buy bigger and better, they will be paying much more in taxes than they do now-it can\u2019t be hidden. next, you claim \u201cInstead, the sales tax rate, according to \u201cfairtax\u201d, would go up - AT FIRST - to 23%. And this is just the FEDERAL rate. There are still those State & local additions, where applicable, to the federal sales tax that already exist. These additions could add another 7% or so.
