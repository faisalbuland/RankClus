'http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg3-2009mar03,0,1748845.column' From the Los Angeles Times Opinion The tired war on Rush Limbaugh The conservative commentator said he hopes Barack Obama fails. But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

'http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg3-2009mar03,0,1748845.column' From the Los Angeles Times Opinion The tired war on Rush Limbaugh The conservative commentator said he hopes Barack Obama fails. But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries.

You obviously disapprove of his bailouts, infusions of cash in the stimulus package, etc. ... what is it that you would do differently at this point? (And please, do offer something more creatively effective than continuing the Bush tax cuts). Okay...more creativity...Bush tax cuts AND cutting the spending of Government. I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy.

But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years.

More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones.

Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy.

When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth? How come it is okay to raise the taxes on the owners of small businesses and expect growth? Just throwing money out there does not do anything.",

I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth? How come it is okay to raise the taxes on the owners of small businesses and expect growth? Just throwing money out there does not do anything.

But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones.

I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth?

But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth? How come it is okay to raise the taxes on the owners of small businesses and expect growth? Just throwing money out there does not do anything.",

'http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg3-2009mar03,0,1748845.column' From the Los Angeles Times Opinion The tired war on Rush Limbaugh The conservative commentator said he hopes Barack Obama fails. But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity.

Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

'http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg3-2009mar03,0,1748845.column' From the Los Angeles Times Opinion The tired war on Rush Limbaugh The conservative commentator said he hopes Barack Obama fails. But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic?

The federal and state governments are going to have to curtail all but essential services in the short run to keep their operations solvent, it seems. As regards the stimulus package (and bypassing the needless pork that unfortunately \"infiltrated\" that package), from everything I've read and heard by genuinely respected economists, we need some measure of that to keep the economy from truly freefalling. And obviously we need the liquidity in the banking system to prime the economic pump for both businesses and consumers. There are are radical policy moves but given the severity of this economic crisis, we need \"radical surgery,\" not mere bandaids or exploratory surgery to help this situation stabilize.

But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates.

When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries.

You obviously disapprove of his bailouts, infusions of cash in the stimulus package, etc. ... what is it that you would do differently at this point? (And please, do offer something more creatively effective than continuing the Bush tax cuts). Okay...more creativity...Bush tax cuts AND cutting the spending of Government. I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth? How come it is okay to raise the taxes on the owners of small businesses and expect growth? Just throwing money out there does not do anything.",

But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates.

I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth? How come it is okay to raise the taxes on the owners of small businesses and expect growth? Just throwing money out there does not do anything.",

I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth? How come it is okay to raise the taxes on the owners of small businesses and expect growth? Just throwing money out there does not do anything.

But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today.

I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated.

But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

I previously started a thread trying to understand how Pres Bushes tax cuts were bad. What I came away understanding was that tax cuts need cutting in government spending. If you cut taxes on corporations that helps employment and the cost of the product goes down. If you cut taxes on us we have more money to spend/save/pay off debts. Just because the Government makes money by printing it or borrowing with interest does not put more money into our economy. Inflation takes away the value and interest needs to be paid on top of the loan. Let the free market be free. When the cost of housing goes down more people will buy. When more people buy housing goes back up. However...naturally the cost of the house needs to be relative to salaries. The last few years did not reflect meaning the average cost of the houses being bought did not match the average salaries in the US. I will say NAFTA needs to be watered down first then eliminated. I do not think NAFTA is doing what it was designed to do. How can you raise taxes on all of us and expect growth? How come it is okay to raise the taxes on the owners of small businesses and expect growth? Just throwing money out there does not do anything.",

'http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg3-2009mar03,0,1748845.column' From the Los Angeles Times Opinion The tired war on Rush Limbaugh The conservative commentator said he hopes Barack Obama fails. But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic? Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush's Social Security privatization scheme. Regardless, the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash. In 1995, Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush. In 2002, then-Sen. Tom Daschle, the leader of the Democratic opposition, claimed that Limbaugh's listeners weren't \"satisfied just to listen.\" They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him. In just the last month, Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP's leader. Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans didn't give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Does anyone think that Republicans, absent fear of Limbaugh's lash, would be throwing flower petals at Obama's feet as he sells the Great Society II? If that's true, I say thank goodness for Limbaugh's lash. Just because the Democrats' shtick is old and often dishonest doesn't mean it's tactically dumb. Limbaugh and other right-wing talkers are popular with a third of the country. Fairly or not, they turn off moderates and self-described independents (and, for the left, conservative talk radio is the font of all evil). Most politicians would prefer to have 70% of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30%, even if that requires being less than fair to the 30%. <edit> Another point of attack comes from \"reformist\" conservative writers, such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk-show platitudes and Reagan kitsch. They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial, less reflexively opposed to government action. Hence, the New Reformers object to Limbaugh's role as an enforcer of ideological conformity. What's good for Limbaugh, many of them argue, guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers. I'm dubious about that, but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts. Bring back \"Firing Line.\" William F. Buckley Jr., who died almost exactly a year ago, hosted the program for PBS for 33 years. He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today. He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners weren't uniquely liberal qualities. More important, the \"Firing Line\" debates (models of decorum) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones. As Democrats try to ram through the \"remaking of America\" (Obama's words) by exploiting a financial crisis, we need those debates. PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public. It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right-wingers could get behind.",

'http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg3-2009mar03,0,1748845.column' From the Los Angeles Times Opinion The tired war on Rush Limbaugh The conservative commentator said he hopes Barack Obama fails. But what's so radical about disagreeing with an agenda he doesn't believe in? Jonah Goldberg Here we go again. Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1. Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh's statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails. Well, given what Obama wants to do, I hope he fails too. Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who doesn't? But Obama's agenda is much more audacious. Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state. And yet people are shocked that conservatives, Limbaugh included, want Obama to fail in this effort? What movie have they been watching? Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do. It's Aesopian. The scorpion must sting the frog. The conservative must object to socialized medicine. Besides, since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic?

The federal and state governments are going to have to curtail all but essential services in the short run to keep their operations solvent, it seems. As regards the stimulus package (and bypassing the needless pork that unfortunately \"infiltrated\" that package), from everything I've read and heard by genuinely respected economists, we need some measure of that to keep the economy from truly freefalling. And obviously we need the liquidity in the banking system to prime the economic pump for both businesses and consumers. There are are radical policy moves but given the severity of this economic crisis, we need \"radical surgery,\" not mere bandaids or exploratory surgery to help this situation stabilize. Yet...this plan is all about raising taxes and removing more money from our checks. Not only that but my children will be paying for this if I am to believe the economists. This is a big reason why I am against this bill. But I am also against the fact that nobody read the bill before signing because it was physically impossible. If they truly want to help America...cut out the ka ka and put forward the bill with the intent to save jobs/save businesses. Let us see it. Let us have time to understand it. Let us have time to digest it. This bill is exploratory because it has never worked.
