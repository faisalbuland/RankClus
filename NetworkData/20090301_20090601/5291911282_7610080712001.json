He told me \"I'm 23 years old. I have a son who's 16 months old and another one on the way. I've made some mistakes in my life, but it's time for me to be a man. I'm going to marry my babies' mother, and join the Army. Times are tough, and its a good job. If anything happens to me I know she and the boys will be taken care of.\" I almost cried. This is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met and to hear that he is stepping up and taking responsibility for his actions....well...it touched me. I hope that everything goes well and he stays safe. I also hope that someday my daughter meets someone with as much personal integrity as this young man.",
