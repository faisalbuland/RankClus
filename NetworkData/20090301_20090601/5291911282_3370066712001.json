Mix-Up Sends Corpse, Not Fish, To Pet Store Philly Pet Store Owner Says Fish Probably Dead POSTED: 6:27 am EDT March 11, 2009 PHILADELPHIA -- Employees of a Pennsylvania pet store expecting a shipment of tropical fish and salt water received a man's dead body instead. Mark Arabia owns the Pets Plus store in northeast Philadelphia, where the mix-up was discovered Tuesday. He said he learned the body was that of a 65-year-old San Diego-area man who died of early onset Alzheimer's disease. The deceased man's wife said she was shocked initially, but found the former mailman's posthumous postal mix-up funny. The body was supposed to go to a research laboratory in Allentown, 70 miles away. US Airways Inc. released a statement saying the air cargo problem was caused by a \"verbal miscommunication between a delivery driver and the cargo representative.\" The Tempe, Ariz.-based airline said it's deeply sorry. The fish were shipped in three boxes. The corpse was shipped in a wooden coffin wrapped in cardboard. Arabia said the fish were left at the airport and probably died.",

Actually, the laboratory would probably have to deal with the fish as biohazardous waste (rules and regulations at labs and research facilities are different from the regs placed on homes and other businesses), which is expensive and time consuming. If they're doing Alzheimer's research, they have absolutely no use for guppies, so it'll just be a huge hassle. But other than that... yeah, this is a really funny mix-up. And I'm glad the the widow didn't freak out, and could actually see the humor in it. That's pretty cool of her.",
