He said to tell ya just for that he wasnt gonna look in your window anymore. On the other hand the little people out there told him they didnt believe in him eather, most of them got away but he did have to pick a few out from between his toes, he also said he was just gonna stay here in Oklahoma, getting to crowded in the citys. oh well guess we will just have another beer aaaaa coffiee, ya all have a wonderful day D.J. Just one more thing Mr. foot (he is shy about being called Big Foot) says not to worry about the man with the hook, He says the stupid fella tryed to go fishing and got it hooked into about a 120 lb. spoonbill catfish and lost it.

He said to tell ya just for that he wasnt gonna look in your window anymore. On the other hand the little people out there told him they didnt believe in him eather, most of them got away but he did have to pick a few out from between his toes, he also said he was just gonna stay here in Oklahoma, getting to crowded in the citys. oh well guess we will just have another beer aaaaa coffiee, ya all have a wonderful day D.J. Just one more thing Mr. foot (he is shy about being called Big Foot) says not to worry about the man with the hook, He says the stupid fella tryed to go fishing and got it hooked into about a 120 lb. spoonbill catfish and lost it.
