        "content": "I have seen some surveys on this site before and it seems that they always get the same right sided skew or left sided skew when the poster put up the survey. This set of questions has absolutely NO bias or political basis. Question: Skqwerels are cute and fuzzy. Would you consider a skqwerel feeder in your yard? Choices: Yes, I love Skqwerels :) Yes, they need to eat too. :0 Maybe, if they didn't stay up all night partying like the Senior class of some Rural Texas High School. Only when they can't find their own food. Only if I can put the feeder in front of my bullseye. No, they can find their own food. Only if I can put Rat Poison in the feeder Question: Does singing Kumbayah help sooth your soul? Choices: No, I hate that song and my voice cracks on high notes. I could do without the singing or that song, let me sleep. Only if a girl is singing while jumping on a trampoline in a skirt. If somebody has a campfire and Smore's I sing anything. With any group at the campsite, I got lost and this was the only light I could see. With my Hubby, on the beach, naked, blankets? We don't need no steeekeen blankets! Anytime, Anywhere, with Anyone. I love \"Kumbayah\"!!! Question: Has the Internet improved your S-E-X Life? Choices: No, puter's can't fix UGLY. and Photoshop goes into a fatal error everytime my picture comes up. :( As long as my mouse is for the left hand and I wear a faceshield. In my own mind which is under repair at this time. I get lots of E-mails from women I don't know and they want my credit card number. My E-mail box is full, since I put my younger sibling's picture on my Bio. I get dates once in a while. My E-mail fills up on a regular basis with e-mails from young single people. I'm freekin dyin, I get No Sleep, No rest for the wicked. Too much SEX!!! Question: I use computers all the time, I am pretty good at fixing them and even have a propeller cap to prove my worthiness. Choices: No, I can barely find the on/off button and I'm afraid of \"MICE\". Does anybody know how I can change my screen color back to what it was before I set the fonts to the same color? I took a computer class and even got some private lesson from the professor. :0 My POSSLQ does it all for me and I learn something in the process. Im cool, I can upload pictures, cut and paste and download software. I am still working on a RED HAT Linux operating system I started in College. I can see you in your underwear through your webcam which I turned on with a hack I wrote in Middle School. Question: Can you ride a bike and chew bubble bum at the same time? Choices: I tried that once and almost choked on the bubble gum. I can chew the gum and ride the bike but my brain won't do both at once. I bit my tongue!!! :( If someone gives me a big push and I start chewing at the same time. I have been known to ride my bike, chew gum and whistle show tunes. I can ride my bike, Chew gum, and recite the Constitution. I can ride my bike in wheelie, chew gum, blow bubbles, jump the Grand Canyon and show Evel Knevel the ropes. Question: If I were Stranded on a Desert Island who would I have with me for conversation? Choices: sargeant_green cause he got me into this Jam in the first place. If I only had a coconut hammer, MAXWELL! Jesus, for all those unanswered questions in my mind. John Mc Cain, So he could show me what he knows about survival. Emeril, Hey ya gotta eat right? :) Arnold Schwartsnegger, you never know what might be in the jungle, right? My Dog everybody else is boring. Wilson the ball... Question: What is your favorite Season? Choices: Winter, cause I like snow and I own a towing co. Spring, cause I been freezin all winter and Al Gore is a MORON! Summer, cause I like roasting in the SUN, where's that SUNBLOCK!!! Fall, cause my skin is burnt, I forgot the SUNBLOCK!!! Question: What do you think of SURVEYS? Choices: I hate surveys they take too much time to answer a bunch of stooopid questions. I could do without the survey, I have other things to do and this is just a bother. Surveys have their place, I am curious as to the results everytime I do one. I love to take surveys, they make me think about myself and where I'm going. Survey? Where? I gotta take it just because I gotta take a survey every minute of every day... Jeez I love SURVEYS!!! Question: Who is the most modern, intelligent, handsome, articulate, caring, graceful, intellectual, desirable, funny, powerful, potent and humble poster on the pages of MILITARY Dot Com? Choices: sargeant_green Sgt. Green \"The Green Dood\" J C Green The Secret Skqwerel Question: Am I nutz or WHAT???

        "content": "I have seen some surveys on this site before and it seems that they always get the same right sided skew or left sided skew when the poster put up the survey. This set of questions has absolutely NO bias or political basis. Question: Skqwerels are cute and fuzzy. Would you consider a skqwerel feeder in your yard? Choices: Yes, I love Skqwerels :) Yes, they need to eat too. :0 Maybe, if they didn't stay up all night partying like the Senior class of some Rural Texas High School. Only when they can't find their own food. Only if I can put the feeder in front of my bullseye. No, they can find their own food. Only if I can put Rat Poison in the feeder Question: Does singing Kumbayah help sooth your soul? Choices: No, I hate that song and my voice cracks on high notes. I could do without the singing or that song, let me sleep. Only if a girl is singing while jumping on a trampoline in a skirt. If somebody has a campfire and Smore's I sing anything. With any group at the campsite, I got lost and this was the only light I could see. With my Hubby, on the beach, naked, blankets? We don't need no steeekeen blankets! Anytime, Anywhere, with Anyone. I love \"Kumbayah\"!!! Question: Has the Internet improved your S-E-X Life? Choices: No, puter's can't fix UGLY. and Photoshop goes into a fatal error everytime my picture comes up. :( As long as my mouse is for the left hand and I wear a faceshield. In my own mind which is under repair at this time. I get lots of E-mails from women I don't know and they want my credit card number. My E-mail box is full, since I put my younger sibling's picture on my Bio. I get dates once in a while. My E-mail fills up on a regular basis with e-mails from young single people. I'm freekin dyin, I get No Sleep, No rest for the wicked. Too much SEX!!! Question: I use computers all the time, I am pretty good at fixing them and even have a propeller cap to prove my worthiness. Choices: No, I can barely find the on/off button and I'm afraid of \"MICE\". Does anybody know how I can change my screen color back to what it was before I set the fonts to the same color? I took a computer class and even got some private lesson from the professor. :0 My POSSLQ does it all for me and I learn something in the process. Im cool, I can upload pictures, cut and paste and download software. I am still working on a RED HAT Linux operating system I started in College. I can see you in your underwear through your webcam which I turned on with a hack I wrote in Middle School. Question: Can you ride a bike and chew bubble bum at the same time? Choices: I tried that once and almost choked on the bubble gum. I can chew the gum and ride the bike but my brain won't do both at once. I bit my tongue!!! :( If someone gives me a big push and I start chewing at the same time. I have been known to ride my bike, chew gum and whistle show tunes. I can ride my bike, Chew gum, and recite the Constitution. I can ride my bike in wheelie, chew gum, blow bubbles, jump the Grand Canyon and show Evel Knevel the ropes. Question: If I were Stranded on a Desert Island who would I have with me for conversation? Choices: sargeant_green cause he got me into this Jam in the first place. If I only had a coconut hammer, MAXWELL! Jesus, for all those unanswered questions in my mind. John Mc Cain, So he could show me what he knows about survival. Emeril, Hey ya gotta eat right? :) Arnold Schwartsnegger, you never know what might be in the jungle, right? My Dog everybody else is boring. Wilson the ball... Question: What is your favorite Season? Choices: Winter, cause I like snow and I own a towing co. Spring, cause I been freezin all winter and Al Gore is a MORON! Summer, cause I like roasting in the SUN, where's that SUNBLOCK!!! Fall, cause my skin is burnt, I forgot the SUNBLOCK!!! Question: What do you think of SURVEYS? Choices: I hate surveys they take too much time to answer a bunch of stooopid questions. I could do without the survey, I have other things to do and this is just a bother. Surveys have their place, I am curious as to the results everytime I do one. I love to take surveys, they make me think about myself and where I'm going. Survey? Where? I gotta take it just because I gotta take a survey every minute of every day... Jeez I love SURVEYS!!! Question: Who is the most modern, intelligent, handsome, articulate, caring, graceful, intellectual, desirable, funny, powerful, potent and humble poster on the pages of MILITARY Dot Com?

        "content": "I have seen some surveys on this site before and it seems that they always get the same right sided skew or left sided skew when the poster put up the survey. This set of questions has absolutely NO bias or political basis. Question: Skqwerels are cute and fuzzy. Would you consider a skqwerel feeder in your yard? Choices: Yes, I love Skqwerels :) Yes, they need to eat too. :0 Maybe, if they didn't stay up all night partying like the Senior class of some Rural Texas High School. Only when they can't find their own food. Only if I can put the feeder in front of my bullseye. No, they can find their own food. Only if I can put Rat Poison in the feeder Question: Does singing Kumbayah help sooth your soul? Choices: No, I hate that song and my voice cracks on high notes. I could do without the singing or that song, let me sleep. Only if a girl is singing while jumping on a trampoline in a skirt. If somebody has a campfire and Smore's I sing anything. With any group at the campsite, I got lost and this was the only light I could see. With my Hubby, on the beach, naked, blankets? We don't need no steeekeen blankets! Anytime, Anywhere, with Anyone. I love \"Kumbayah\"!!! Question: Has the Internet improved your S-E-X Life? Choices: No, puter's can't fix UGLY. and Photoshop goes into a fatal error everytime my picture comes up. :( As long as my mouse is for the left hand and I wear a faceshield. In my own mind which is under repair at this time. I get lots of E-mails from women I don't know and they want my credit card number. My E-mail box is full, since I put my younger sibling's picture on my Bio. I get dates once in a while. My E-mail fills up on a regular basis with e-mails from young single people. I'm freekin dyin, I get No Sleep, No rest for the wicked. Too much SEX!!! Question: I use computers all the time, I am pretty good at fixing them and even have a propeller cap to prove my worthiness. Choices: No, I can barely find the on/off button and I'm afraid of \"MICE\". Does anybody know how I can change my screen color back to what it was before I set the fonts to the same color? I took a computer class and even got some private lesson from the professor. :0 My POSSLQ does it all for me and I learn something in the process. Im cool, I can upload pictures, cut and paste and download software. I am still working on a RED HAT Linux operating system I started in College. I can see you in your underwear through your webcam which I turned on with a hack I wrote in Middle School. Question: Can you ride a bike and chew bubble bum at the same time? Choices: I tried that once and almost choked on the bubble gum. I can chew the gum and ride the bike but my brain won't do both at once. I bit my tongue!!! :( If someone gives me a big push and I start chewing at the same time. I have been known to ride my bike, chew gum and whistle show tunes. I can ride my bike, Chew gum, and recite the Constitution. I can ride my bike in wheelie, chew gum, blow bubbles, jump the Grand Canyon and show Evel Knevel the ropes. Question: If I were Stranded on a Desert Island who would I have with me for conversation? Choices: sargeant_green cause he got me into this Jam in the first place. If I only had a coconut hammer, MAXWELL! Jesus, for all those unanswered questions in my mind. John Mc Cain, So he could show me what he knows about survival. Emeril, Hey ya gotta eat right? :) Arnold Schwartsnegger, you never know what might be in the jungle, right? My Dog everybody else is boring. Wilson the ball... Question: What is your favorite Season? Choices: Winter, cause I like snow and I own a towing co. Spring, cause I been freezin all winter and Al Gore is a MORON! Summer, cause I like roasting in the SUN, where's that SUNBLOCK!!! Fall, cause my skin is burnt, I forgot the SUNBLOCK!!! Question: What do you think of SURVEYS? Choices: I hate surveys they take too much time to answer a bunch of stooopid questions. I could do without the survey, I have other things to do and this is just a bother. Surveys have their place, I am curious as to the results everytime I do one. I love to take surveys, they make me think about myself and where I'm going. Survey? Where? I gotta take it just because I gotta take a survey every minute of every day... Jeez I love SURVEYS!!! Question: Who is the most modern, intelligent, handsome, articulate, caring, graceful, intellectual, desirable, funny, powerful, potent and humble poster on the pages of MILITARY Dot Com?
