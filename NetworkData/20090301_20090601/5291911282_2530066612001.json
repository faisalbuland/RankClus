        "content": "\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor's_Naked_Army_Marches_On\" I just watched this fascinating documentary. Any history buffs should check it out. \"The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On (\u3086\u304d\u3086\u304d\u3066\u3001\u795e\u8ecd ,Yuki Yukite Shingun?) is an award-winning 1987 documentary by director Kazuo Hara. The documentary centers on 62-year-old veteran of Japan's Second World War campaign in New Guinea, Kenzo Okuzaki, and follows him around as he searches out those responsible for the mysterious deaths of several soldiers in his old unit. Though Okuzaki ultimately holds Emperor Hirohito accountable for all the suffering of the war, he painstakingly tracks down former military officers and accuses them of specific war crimes, often abusing them verbally and at times physically in the process. The movie was five years in the making.\" This ex-Japanese soldier now investigative journalist puts Michael Moore and his ilk to shame. He is interviewing soldiers that were left on New Guinea after the war ended, trying to find out who executed two privates for desertion a month after they had learned the war ended. The soldiers knew the war was over, but were ordered to fight to the death. The regiment had no food and had been eating natives and allied prisoners. It comes to light that these two privates had either not partaken and were removed so they wouldn't talk or that they were killed in order to feed other soldiers in the regiment. This ex-Japanese soldier, with cameras rolling goes nuts on one of the executors and starts kicking his ass in his own house. Japanese cops are really polite! They try to reason with the ex-soldier while he's got the war criminal in a choke hold. Americans would have gone straight to the night stick. This should be required viewing in US Highschools.",
