This same boat runs in two to three inches of water. We ended up in the Guinness Book of World Records and received massive media attention on TV, Magazines, Newspapers, and Radio. We decided to do it again only this time we are going all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and to use the publicity to raise funds for serveral US, Canadian, and Brittish Foundations. We will be doing it in honor of the men that died in Operation Eagle Claw that took place In the Iranian Desert on April 24, 1980. I was on Standby Red Alert at the time in the US Marines and thought I was going to Iran. I have always felt like I should make sure the men that died that day are not forgotten. I hope you will check out our web site and decide to get involved. www.CrossTheAtlantic.com Ralph",
