It seems like the same person is writing all of these smarmy tear-jerkers that aren't true, as if that will make me more grateful for the sacrifice of others. A question to real Marines: I've never heard a Marine refer to himself as an \"Old Soldier\" before; in fact I've seen people get corrected when they make the mistake of calling a Marine a 'Soldier.' The Marine in this story calls himself and his buddy 'soldier' twice. Like I said, I'm not familiar with this. Do Marines ever refer to themselves as soldiers?",
