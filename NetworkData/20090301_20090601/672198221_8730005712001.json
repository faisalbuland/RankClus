The surge did work. I was there in Baghdad from November 07 to Feb 09, and I saw the difference in places like Sadr City first hand. In conjunction with the surge the biggest shift was in th ability of the Iraqi Army and Police to conduct operations on their own or with limited assistance. After the invasion in 2003 the Iraqi military ceased to exist. In 2004 the Iraqi Army began to be rebuilt, but they lacked everything from vehicles to tanks to supplies of uniforms. In Iraqi I was on a training team under MNSTC-I, the other 3 star command there besides MNC-I. I lived and worked at an Iraqi regional training center. Over the course of the year I was there we graduated nearly 10,000 Iraqi soldiers from basic training, and we were just one of a dozen training centers. We also fielded tens of thousands of M-16s and M-4s, thousands of HMMWVs, over 10,000 SINCGARS variant radios, and had an operating CIF for uniforms and field gear. We built ranges, obstacle courses, live fire shoot houses, and many other things. By the time I left our basic training mission went from 1200-1500 soldiers per cycle to 300-400 because the divisions are at strength and they were not building new manuever units. One of the biggest successes was conducting actual Warfighter exercises on a battalion scale. We taught the staffs, COIN, and battle tracking. The surge provided the breathing room and security to build confidence in the Iraqi's own security forces. Like us they have an AVF, and they are not short of recruits. That is the success in Iraq. I met and worked with hundreds of young IA officers and soldiers that know their business. They have the training, they are capable, and now they are out doing it.",

One of the biggest successes was conducting actual Warfighter exercises on a battalion scale. We taught the staffs, COIN, and battle tracking. The surge provided the breathing room and security to build confidence in the Iraqi's own security forces. Like us they have an AVF, and they are not short of recruits. That is the success in Iraq. I met and worked with hundreds of young IA officers and soldiers that know their business. They have the training, they are capable, and now they are out doing it.",
        "reply": " Absolutely concur. The increase in numbers allowed a greater permanent presence among the populace. Sort of like establishing permanent courts and local law enforcement instead of depending on US Marshalls and far flung Cavalry posts, tamed the US West.",

Of course you realise that the surge was NOT the biggest factor in the improvement in Iraq (no matter what the Pol spin said) it was the FACT that the US had started following the Counter Insurgency Manual and took advantage of an Al Quaeda mistake (attacking Sunni tribal members in an effort to grab control from local tribal leaders) and shifted the Sunni forces fighing the US to fighting for the US against Al Quaeda.

Of course you realise that the surge was NOT the biggest factor in the improvement in Iraq (no matter what the Pol spin said) it was the FACT that the US had started following the Counter Insurgency Manual and took advantage of an Al Quaeda mistake (attacking Sunni tribal members in an effort to grab control from local tribal leaders) and shifted the Sunni forces fighing the US to fighting for the US against Al Quaeda. The surge did work. I was there in Baghdad from November 07 to Feb 09, and I saw the difference in places like Sadr City first hand. In conjunction with the surge the biggest shift was in th ability of the Iraqi Army and Police to conduct operations on their own or with limited assistance. After the invasion in 2003 the Iraqi military ceased to exist. In 2004 the Iraqi Army began to be rebuilt, but they lacked everything from vehicles to tanks to supplies of uniforms. In Iraqi I was on a training team under MNSTC-I, the other 3 star command there besides MNC-I. I lived and worked at an Iraqi regional training center. Over the course of the year I was there we graduated nearly 10,000 Iraqi soldiers from basic training, and we were just one of a dozen training centers. We also fielded tens of thousands of M-16s and M-4s, thousands of HMMWVs, over 10,000 SINCGARS variant radios, and had an operating CIF for uniforms and field gear. We built ranges, obstacle courses, live fire shoot houses, and many other things. By the time I left our basic training mission went from 1200-1500 soldiers per cycle to 300-400 because the divisions are at strength and they were not building new manuever units. One of the biggest successes was conducting actual Warfighter exercises on a battalion scale. We taught the staffs, COIN, and battle tracking. The surge provided the breathing room and security to build confidence in the Iraqi's own security forces. Like us they have an AVF, and they are not short of recruits. That is the success in Iraq. I met and worked with hundreds of young IA officers and soldiers that know their business. They have the training, they are capable, and now they are out doing it.",

The surge did work. I was there in Baghdad from November 07 to Feb 09, and I saw the difference in places like Sadr City first hand. In conjunction with the surge the biggest shift was in th ability of the Iraqi Army and Police to conduct operations on their own or with limited assistance. After the invasion in 2003 the Iraqi military ceased to exist. In 2004 the Iraqi Army began to be rebuilt, but they lacked everything from vehicles to tanks to supplies of uniforms. In Iraqi I was on a training team under MNSTC-I, the other 3 star command there besides MNC-I. I lived and worked at an Iraqi regional training center. Over the course of the year I was there we graduated nearly 10,000 Iraqi soldiers from basic training, and we were just one of a dozen training centers. We also fielded tens of thousands of M-16s and M-4s, thousands of HMMWVs, over 10,000 SINCGARS variant radios, and had an operating CIF for uniforms and field gear. We built ranges, obstacle courses, live fire shoot houses, and many other things. By the time I left our basic training mission went from 1200-1500 soldiers per cycle to 300-400 because the divisions are at strength and they were not building new manuever units. One of the biggest successes was conducting actual Warfighter exercises on a battalion scale. We taught the staffs, COIN, and battle tracking. The surge provided the breathing room and security to build confidence in the Iraqi's own security forces. Like us they have an AVF, and they are not short of recruits. That is the success in Iraq. I met and worked with hundreds of young IA officers and soldiers that know their business. They have the training, they are capable, and now they are out doing it.",

Of course you realise that the surge was NOT the biggest factor in the improvement in Iraq (no matter what the Pol spin said) it was the FACT that the US had started following the Counter Insurgency Manual and took advantage of an Al Quaeda mistake (attacking Sunni tribal members in an effort to grab control from local tribal leaders) and shifted the Sunni forces fighing the US to fighting for the US against Al Quaeda. The surge did work. I was there in Baghdad from November 07 to Feb 09, and I saw the difference in places like Sadr City first hand. In conjunction with the surge the biggest shift was in th ability of the Iraqi Army and Police to conduct operations on their own or with limited assistance. -snip-. nspreitler I did NOT say the surge did not help I said \"he surge was NOT the biggest factor in the improvement in Iraq\". The surge was for the Baghdad area NOT Iraq as a whole. I think the evidence shows quite clearly that convincing the Sunni tribal leaders to shift to fighting Al Queada for the US rather helping Al Quaeda fight the US and the US backed Iraqi government had a much bigger impact on Iraq as a whole than the surge. The Sons of Iraq did help in Sunni areas. In Baghdad it was the Shia Mahdi Army that was the biggest threat. About this time last year the IZ had earned its name as the \"Impact Zone\" because of all the ortars and rockets being lobbed at it. After the offensive operation in April and May that area has become much safer. That was a combined US and Iraqi offensive. There is no doubt that the application of counterinsurgency tactics worked very well. It also increased the number of advisors. Where I was every Iraqi manuever battalion had a MiTT with it. Once Sadr City was calmed down the breathing room in Baghdad allowed us to rotate Iraqi units off the line and conduct training. The success of the MiTTs is probably the biggest lesson of Iraq.",
