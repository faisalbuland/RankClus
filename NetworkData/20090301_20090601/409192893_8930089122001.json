Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind,\" he said in a statement. \"He left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record. \"Republicans look forward to beating Sen.

Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind,\" he said in a statement. \"He left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record. \"Republicans look forward to beating Sen. Specter in 2010, assuming the Democrats don't do it first.\" As for me, I'm glad that Specter will no longer be a closet Democrat occupying a Republican seat in the Senate. Like Michael Steele, I look forward to Specter's defeat in the 2010 elections.",

They have been targeting him for years and have now handed another seat to the Demos in the Senate because if he wins the Demo nomination he will win the election and if he loses IMO the presummed Repub candidate will still lose unless the Demo candidate messes up. His list is long and distinguished why he is not liked by the republican party. Abortion stance is just but a little part of it. their may be other issues that from time to time the party leadership has disagreed with him on BUT during party nomination elections the issue used to attack him (especially grassroot attacks) by the local party in Pa is abortion. Negative, the stim package sealed his fate. Michael Steele even announced it. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?\" - Joseph Stalin",
