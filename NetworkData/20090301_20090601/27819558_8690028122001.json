Reichert Texas A & M University April 21, 2009 As a doctoral student in Counseling Psychology at Texas A&M University, I am currently conducting research on the open secret, a phrase sometimes used to describe situations where a gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (GLBT) person's sexuality is known, but not discussed. For example, Kenji Yoshino, a dean and law professor at Yale University and the author of Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights, notes that, \"Many gay people have had this experience of the 'open secret.' I was gay \u2013 she knew I was gay \u2013 I knew she knew I was gay ... [But] because I would never acknowledge our collective knowledge, she could not do so either. So we carried on \u2013 each week more strained than the last\" \"The military's policy is designed so that nobody knows, but in reality, people do know; yet, they cannot confirm their knowledge by asking or telling, and that is what seems to be problematic. If GLBT servicemembers were allowed to simply disclose their sexual orientation \u2013 get it out in the open, let everyone talk about it, and then move on \u2013 the secrecy and mistrust could dissipate. The policy suggests that people in the military cannot handle having an openly GLBT person in their midst. This would seem to seriously underestimate the intelligence and abilities of America\u2019s men and women in uniform.\" Andrew D. Reichert is a doctoral student in Counseling Psychology at Texas A&M University. An ordained minister in The United Methodist Church, he holds a Master of Science in Educational Psychology from Texas A&M University and a Master of Divinity from Duke University.
