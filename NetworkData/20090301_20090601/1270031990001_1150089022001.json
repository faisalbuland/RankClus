The older of the two pulls a bag out of her purse and starts flipping through photos. They start reminiscing. \"This is my oldest son Michael. He would have been 24 years old now.\" \"Yes, I remember him as a baby\" says the other mother cheerfully. \"He's a martyr now, though. The bomb he was wiring to the abortion doctor's car ignition went off too soon.\" she confides. \"Oh, so sad, dear\" says the other. \"And this is my second son, Keith. He would have been 21.\" \"Oh, I remember him,\" says the other happily, \"he had such curly hair when he was born\". \"He's a martyr too. He was making a bomb to blow up that hospital where abortions are performed and it blew up prematurely\" says the mother quietly. \"Oh, gracious me ...\" says the other. \"And this is my third son. My baby. My beautiful John. He would have been 18\", she whispers. \"Yes\" says the friend enthusiastically, \"I remember when he first started school.\" \"He's a martyr also,\" says the mother, with tears in her eyes. After a pause and a deep sigh, the second mother looks wistfully at the photographs and says... \"Children...they blow up so fast, don't they...\"",
