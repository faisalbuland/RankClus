        "content": "I must say, that while Obama has been a big disappointment to me in many respects, his public speeches are inspirational. One of the Great speakers of our time. Here are some of my favorite excerpts from his Commencement Address at Annapolis. I recoment reading the whole speech. He truly clarifies, what American Values are, and how the military upholds them. quote: But most of all, I\u2019ve admired the spirit of your service. Because it\u2019s not the strength of our arms or the power of our technology that gives the United States our military dominance. It\u2019s our people. It\u2019s our Sailors and Marines, Soldiers and Airmen and Coast Guardsmen who perform brilliantly in every mission we give them. ************** This class is about to become the latest link in a long, unbroken chain of heroism and victory. A chain forged in battles whose names are etched in the stone of this stadium. From Coral Sea to Midway to Guadalcanal. From Iwo Jima to Inchon. From the Mekong Delta to Desert Storm. For some among us, these are not just places on a map. They are the stories of their lives. And we honor all our veterans here today. This chain of service calls to mind words that were spoken here in Annapolis on another spring day a century ago. The crowds assembled, the bands played, and the cannons roared. And as John Paul Jones\u2019 body was carried to the Yard, President Teddy Roosevelt spoke to the Midshipmen gathered there that day. \"Remember,\" he said, \"our words of admiration are but as sounding brass and tinkling symbols if we do not\u2026prepare to emulate their deeds.\" Emulate their deeds. That is what you are called upon to do. And in doing so these past four years, you have not only given meaning to your own lives, you serve as a reminder\u2014a challenge\u2014to your fellow Americans to fulfill the true meaning of citizenship. America, look at these young men and women. Look at these Sailors and Marines. Here are the values we cherish. Here are the ideals that endure. In an era when too few citizens answer the call to service\u2014to community or country\u2014these Americans chose to serve. And they did so in a time of war, knowing they might be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice. ************* In a culture where so many chase the outward markers of success that can so often lead us astray\u2014titles and status, materialism and money, fame and popularity\u2014these Americans have embraced the virtues that we need most right now. Self-discipline over self-interest. Work over comfort. Character over celebrity. After an era when so many institutions and individuals acted with such greed and recklessness, it is no wonder that our military remains the most trusted institution in the nation. And in a world when so many forces and voices seek to divide us, it is inspiring that this class came together and succeeded together, from every state and every corner of the world. By building an institution that is more diverse than ever\u2014more women, more Hispanics, more African Americans\u2014the Naval Academy has reaffirmed a fundamental American truth: that out of many, we are one. We see these values in every one of these Sailors and Marines, including those who have already served their country\u2014the dozens among you with prior enlisted service. ************ Honor. Courage. Commitment. These are the values that have defined your years in the Yard and that you\u2019ll need in the years ahead. As you join the fleet. As you lead Marines. As you confront the ever-changing threats of an ever-changing world. For history teaches us that the nations that grow comfortable with the old ways and complacent in the face of new threats\u2014those nations do not long endure. And in the 21st century, we do not have the luxury of deciding which challenges to prepare for and which to ignore. We must overcome the full spectrum of threats. The conventional and the unconventional. The nation-state and the terrorist network. The spread of deadly technologies and of hateful ideologies. Eighteenth century-style piracy and 21st century cyberthreats. ***************** Marines\u2014we need you to defeat the insurgent and the extremist. But we also need you to work with the tribal sheik and local leaders from Anbar to Kandahar who want to build a better future for their people. Naval aviators and flight officers\u2014we need you to dominate the airspace in times of conflict, but also to deliver food and medicine in times of humanitarian crisis. And surface warfare officers and submariners\u2014we need you to project American power across the vast oceans, but also to project American principles and values when you pull into that foreign port\u2014because for so many people around the world, you are the face of America. ************** Yesterday I visited the National Archives and the hall that holds our Constitution, Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. I went there because as our nation debates how to deal with the security challenges that we face, we must remember this enduring truth: the values and ideals in those documents are not simply words written into aging parchment, they are the bedrock of our liberty and our security. We uphold our fundamental principles and values not just because we choose to, but because we swear to. Not because they feel good, but because they help keep us safe. Because when America strays from our values, it not only undermines the rule of law, it alienates us from our allies, it energizes our adversaries and it endangers our national security and the lives of our troops. So as Americans, we reject the false chose between our security and our ideals. We can and we must and we will protect both. And that is just what you will pledge to do in a few moments when you raise your right hand and take your oath. By that simple act you will accept a life of great sacrifice. Long deployments. Separation for loved ones. Tests and trials that most Americans cannot imagine. But that is the oath you take, the life you choose, the promise you make to America. And, today, this is the promise I make to you. It\u2019s a promise that as long as I am your Commander in Chief, I will only send you into harm\u2019s way when it is absolutely necessary, and with the strategy, the well-defined goals, the equipment and the support you need to get the job done. This includes the job of bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end and pursuing a new comprehensive strategy to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. And to get you the support you need, we\u2019re enlisting all elements of our national power\u2014our diplomacy and development and our economic might and our moral suasion\u2014so that you and the rest of our military do not bear the burden of our security alone. We will also ensure you can meet the missions of today, which is why we\u2019ve halted reductions in Navy personnel and increased the size of the Marine Corps. And we will ensure you can meet the missions of tomorrow, which is why we\u2019re investing in the capabilities and technologies\u2014the littoral combat ships, the most advanced submarines and fighter aircraft\u2014so that you have what you need to succeed. In short, we will maintain America\u2019s military dominance and keep you the finest fighting force the world has ever seen. http://www.usna.edu/PAO/",

When the US went to war in 1941, factories worked around the clock. I mean this literally. In THIS war, factories worked nine to five. No additional companies were hired. No overtime was suggested. It took more than four years for our troops to get the equipment that the military said we needed. Looked at objectively, this is unbelievable. The military in the form of the head of the Joint Chiefs, said point blank that we needed at least 200,000, better, 500,000 men to safely pacify the country and prevent an insurgency. For his trouble he was forced into retirement. I was against the war from the beginning, but if you're GOING to actually fight a war, don't do it on the cheap. Penny wise and dollar foolish is why we are still there. To my mind it's all academic. Here's a short Editorial from the US Army's own \"Strategic Studies Institute.\" Mind you, not something I grabbed from Moveon dot org... quote: IN DEFENSE OF RATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Freier Strategic Studies Institute Risk in Webster\u2019s is \u201cthe possibility of suffering harm or loss.\u201d1 Risk accompanies both action and inaction. To strategists, it is accounted for and mitigated, but not always or even commonly avoided. To the national security strategist, risk\u2014to paraphrase the current defense strategy\u2014is the likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost in pursuit of key objectives. In this view, some goals are beyond reach. Others are within reach, but the cost of achieving them puts more important ambitions in some jeopardy.2 Unfortunately, those familiar with contemporary strategic-level military decisionmaking know that rational consideration of even the prospect of failure is absent. In high-level policy discussions, success is assumed. From the beginning, Iraq was an experiment in risk taking. To be sure, the war\u2019s advocates saw it as risk mitigation as well\u2014remember \u2018smoking guns\u2019 and \u2018mushroom clouds,\u2019 for example. However, at its core, toppling Saddam was about balancing the certainty of violent dislocation that accompanies overthrow of an unfavorable but stable status quo against the hope for a more favorable, future post-war political order. It was extension of \u201cthe democratic peace\u201d by force\u2014whether or not the forcible export of representative governance was ever a formal casus belli. In this context, Iraq engendered enormous risk from the beginning. There was the ever-present \u2018likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost\u2019 that needed to be accounted for in deliberate planning. For example, there were obvious dormant sectarian divisions. Given Saddam\u2019s violent separation of ruler from ruled, this indicated the distinct possibility of uncontrolled civil conflict in the aftermath of the government\u2019s collapse. There was the extant Iraqi overdependence on primary resource exports for government revenues. This, in the developing world (which Iraq rejoined from below in 2003), commonly signals persistent danger to political order. There was a certainty that at least two of Iraq\u2019s neighbors would actively resist through politics, influence, and at times, violence\u2014American success. Still others would be very sympathetic to Iraq\u2019s minority Sunni; if not quite hostile to Shi\u2019a or Kurdish triumph. Others still\u2014likely most\u2014would remain reticent on the issue of Iraq\u2019s democratic success or failure. Finally, there was the precedent of the Soviet Afghan War. In Afghanistan (circa 1979-89), external intervention was a magnet for Muslim anti-colonial resistance. Tribalism, nationalism, and Muslim extremism combined to militate against Soviet success. These same forces join today with internecine sectarianism to similarly check American progress in Iraq. Rational risk assessment in advance of the Iraq intervention would have identified and accounted for all of these. Each, after all\u2014individually or in combination, could be enough to seriously delay favorable outcomes, prevent success, or drive strategic costs to prohibitive levels. Evaluating each seriously, thoughtfully considering their implications, and accounting for them deliberately in strategy development is a sign of wisdom, not fear. Instead, those engineering the Iraq War framed strategic risk incorrectly. They assumed ultimate success\u2014a stable, representative, multifaith polity\u2014would rapidly and naturally occur as a result of the necessary but decidedly intermediate step of overthrowing the existing regime. Thus, in their view, the likelihood for some near-term \u201charm or loss\u201d was insignificant compared to the anticipated return on the nation\u2019s strategic investment. Their risk calculations simply never went beyond D-Day. It is now well-documented that Iraq policy was made in a strategic vacuum. It appears no vizier-like or mandarin-like class on the inside carefully weighed specific grand strategic options vis-\u00e0-vis the United States, Iraq, and the world in detail, calculating different choices and their inherent risks and benefits. There were prescient warnings. It is now clear few were heeded. In short, the risk problem, as it was likely presented to the President, was a strawman. It failed to account comprehensively for the real hazards engendered in deliberate regime destruction, stabilization, and reconstruction in a large, consequential state. Iraq proceeded from risk assessment that in its sophistication went little beyond \u201cnothing ventured nothing gained.\u201d This is a caution for the future. Risk-informed strategy does not indicate risk aversion. Identifying risks and hazards and accounting for their mitigation does not prevent action. Rather, it underwrites success. The bold too often mistake thoughtful consideration of real hazard for weakness. Quite the contrary, deliberate consideration of risk-adjusted choices increases the prospect for bold action\u2019s ultimate success. Riskinformed strategy provides decisionmakers with a realistic accounting of strategic conditions as they are, versus as some would prefer them to be. It proceeds from the conclusion that raw capacity and desire alone do not determine success. It recognizes that our perceptions of our motives and intentions are likely quite different from the perceptions of others. Finally, it demands that strategists account for both the prospect of failure and the progressive accumulation of excessive cost that\u2014without mitigation\u2014might jeopardize long-term success and the security of interests of equal or greater importance.

I don't remember exactly but I do remember watching that covered over and over because I was so upset that the military did not have what they needed to keep them safe. Oh yes, and something about a net you keep in the room while sleeping to protect against a bomb? I am sure I don't have it all exactly right, but that is why I am here to learn. When the US went to war in 1941, factories worked around the clock. I mean this literally. In THIS war, factories worked nine to five. No additional companies were hired. No overtime was suggested. It took more than four years for our troops to get the equipment that the military said we needed. Looked at objectively, this is unbelievable. The military in the form of the head of the Joint Chiefs, said point blank that we needed at least 200,000, better, 500,000 men to safely pacify the country and prevent an insurgency. For his trouble he was forced into retirement. I was against the war from the beginning, but if you're GOING to actually fight a war, don't do it on the cheap. Penny wise and dollar foolish is why we are still there. To my mind it's all academic. Here's a short Editorial from the US Army's own \"Strategic Studies Institute.\" Mind you, not something I grabbed from Moveon dot org... quote: IN DEFENSE OF RATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Freier Strategic Studies Institute Risk in Webster\u2019s is \u201cthe possibility of suffering harm or loss.\u201d1 Risk accompanies both action and inaction. To strategists, it is accounted for and mitigated, but not always or even commonly avoided. To the national security strategist, risk\u2014to paraphrase the current defense strategy\u2014is the likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost in pursuit of key objectives. In this view, some goals are beyond reach. Others are within reach, but the cost of achieving them puts more important ambitions in some jeopardy.2 Unfortunately, those familiar with contemporary strategic-level military decisionmaking know that rational consideration of even the prospect of failure is absent. In high-level policy discussions, success is assumed. From the beginning, Iraq was an experiment in risk taking. To be sure, the war\u2019s advocates saw it as risk mitigation as well\u2014remember \u2018smoking guns\u2019 and \u2018mushroom clouds,\u2019 for example. However, at its core, toppling Saddam was about balancing the certainty of violent dislocation that accompanies overthrow of an unfavorable but stable status quo against the hope for a more favorable, future post-war political order. It was extension of \u201cthe democratic peace\u201d by force\u2014whether or not the forcible export of representative governance was ever a formal casus belli. In this context, Iraq engendered enormous risk from the beginning. There was the ever-present \u2018likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost\u2019 that needed to be accounted for in deliberate planning. For example, there were obvious dormant sectarian divisions. Given Saddam\u2019s violent separation of ruler from ruled, this indicated the distinct possibility of uncontrolled civil conflict in the aftermath of the government\u2019s collapse. There was the extant Iraqi overdependence on primary resource exports for government revenues. This, in the developing world (which Iraq rejoined from below in 2003), commonly signals persistent danger to political order. There was a certainty that at least two of Iraq\u2019s neighbors would actively resist through politics, influence, and at times, violence\u2014American success. Still others would be very sympathetic to Iraq\u2019s minority Sunni; if not quite hostile to Shi\u2019a or Kurdish triumph. Others still\u2014likely most\u2014would remain reticent on the issue of Iraq\u2019s democratic success or failure. Finally, there was the precedent of the Soviet Afghan War. In Afghanistan (circa 1979-89), external intervention was a magnet for Muslim anti-colonial resistance. Tribalism, nationalism, and Muslim extremism combined to militate against Soviet success. These same forces join today with internecine sectarianism to similarly check American progress in Iraq. Rational risk assessment in advance of the Iraq intervention would have identified and accounted for all of these. Each, after all\u2014individually or in combination, could be enough to seriously delay favorable outcomes, prevent success, or drive strategic costs to prohibitive levels. Evaluating each seriously, thoughtfully considering their implications, and accounting for them deliberately in strategy development is a sign of wisdom, not fear. Instead, those engineering the Iraq War framed strategic risk incorrectly. They assumed ultimate success\u2014a stable, representative, multifaith polity\u2014would rapidly and naturally occur as a result of the necessary but decidedly intermediate step of overthrowing the existing regime. Thus, in their view, the likelihood for some near-term \u201charm or loss\u201d was insignificant compared to the anticipated return on the nation\u2019s strategic investment. Their risk calculations simply never went beyond D-Day. It is now well-documented that Iraq policy was made in a strategic vacuum. It appears no vizier-like or mandarin-like class on the inside carefully weighed specific grand strategic options vis-\u00e0-vis the United States, Iraq, and the world in detail, calculating different choices and their inherent risks and benefits. There were prescient warnings. It is now clear few were heeded. In short, the risk problem, as it was likely presented to the President, was a strawman. It failed to account comprehensively for the real hazards engendered in deliberate regime destruction, stabilization, and reconstruction in a large, consequential state. Iraq proceeded from risk assessment that in its sophistication went little beyond \u201cnothing ventured nothing gained.\u201d This is a caution for the future. Risk-informed strategy does not indicate risk aversion. Identifying risks and hazards and accounting for their mitigation does not prevent action. Rather, it underwrites success. The bold too often mistake thoughtful consideration of real hazard for weakness. Quite the contrary, deliberate consideration of risk-adjusted choices increases the prospect for bold action\u2019s ultimate success. Riskinformed strategy provides decisionmakers with a realistic accounting of strategic conditions as they are, versus as some would prefer them to be. It proceeds from the conclusion that raw capacity and desire alone do not determine success. It recognizes that our perceptions of our motives and intentions are likely quite different from the perceptions of others. Finally, it demands that strategists account for both the prospect of failure and the progressive accumulation of excessive cost that\u2014without mitigation\u2014might jeopardize long-term success and the security of interests of equal or greater importance.

I did not know congress actually came through with \"every\" amount asked for from Bush, but I am happy to know you say they ended up giving it to him and then some. I actually do remember seeing the floor meetings with the two parties going at it over Iraq and wanting to bring our men and women home. Your memory IMO is so far correct. quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: I am sure you will correct me if I get it wrong..but it was more the Democratic party that had decided we never should have been at war with Iraq, then went on to call war crimes, to suggest Bush be removed from office, and finally to cut off his money as a way to get him to end that war, yes? Some Democrats suggested all of the above. Most Democrats suggested one or another of these acts. No one ever cut off any money. Impeachment (And I regret this) was never seriously on the table - Cutting off funds, even less so. Keep in mind that I can probably find a Republican advocating eating Muslims as a way to solve the World food problems (Perhaps I exagerate here... ) doesn't mean that this represents Republican thinking as a Party. quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: And it was more the Republican party that said, we went into Iraq based on intel from our country and others after being attacked on 9/11, we did not find what we were looking for but took Saddam out anyway who was an evil man, used Iraq as a base thinking Iran would be the big issue and we would have our people both in Afganistan and Irag to cover both sides of Iran, tried to bring freedom to the Iraq people, that ended up being harder than thought but because we did not cut and run when the liberals applied pressure at leeast the vote was a success, but at great cost to America, yes or no? President Bush wanted to invade Iraq long before he was even elected. 9/11 was the excuse. Did he believe Sadaam was an evil man? Sure he did. But there are a lot of evil men in this world. Did he believe that Iraq was an immenent threat to the United States? I doubt that. In fact, HE doubts that. Do I believe that Iraq was part of the WOT? Not a chance. Do I think that taking over Iraq lessened the power of Al Qaeda? I believed it prolonged Al Qaedas life. I believe it strenthed them in every possible way. And I also believe that we have created a new ally for Iran, and although Iran is not a part of the WOT, it does represent a long term threat to us, and we have helped them immensely without it costing them a dime. quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: When they were trying to force Bush in to ending the war on their time table wasn't it that that it was suggested that they would cut off his funds as a way to making him end the war?

        "content": "I must say, that while Obama has been a big disappointment to me in many respects, his public speeches are inspirational. One of the Great speakers of our time. Here are some of my favorite excerpts from his Commencement Address at Annapolis. I recoment reading the whole speech. He truly clarifies, what American Values are, and how the military upholds them. quote: But most of all, I\u2019ve admired the spirit of your service. Because it\u2019s not the strength of our arms or the power of our technology that gives the United States our military dominance. It\u2019s our people. It\u2019s our Sailors and Marines, Soldiers and Airmen and Coast Guardsmen who perform brilliantly in every mission we give them. ************** This class is about to become the latest link in a long, unbroken chain of heroism and victory. A chain forged in battles whose names are etched in the stone of this stadium. From Coral Sea to Midway to Guadalcanal. From Iwo Jima to Inchon. From the Mekong Delta to Desert Storm. For some among us, these are not just places on a map. They are the stories of their lives. And we honor all our veterans here today. This chain of service calls to mind words that were spoken here in Annapolis on another spring day a century ago. The crowds assembled, the bands played, and the cannons roared. And as John Paul Jones\u2019 body was carried to the Yard, President Teddy Roosevelt spoke to the Midshipmen gathered there that day. \"Remember,\" he said, \"our words of admiration are but as sounding brass and tinkling symbols if we do not\u2026prepare to emulate their deeds.\" Emulate their deeds. That is what you are called upon to do. And in doing so these past four years, you have not only given meaning to your own lives, you serve as a reminder\u2014a challenge\u2014to your fellow Americans to fulfill the true meaning of citizenship. America, look at these young men and women. Look at these Sailors and Marines. Here are the values we cherish. Here are the ideals that endure. In an era when too few citizens answer the call to service\u2014to community or country\u2014these Americans chose to serve. And they did so in a time of war, knowing they might be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice. ************* In a culture where so many chase the outward markers of success that can so often lead us astray\u2014titles and status, materialism and money, fame and popularity\u2014these Americans have embraced the virtues that we need most right now. Self-discipline over self-interest. Work over comfort. Character over celebrity. After an era when so many institutions and individuals acted with such greed and recklessness, it is no wonder that our military remains the most trusted institution in the nation. And in a world when so many forces and voices seek to divide us, it is inspiring that this class came together and succeeded together, from every state and every corner of the world. By building an institution that is more diverse than ever\u2014more women, more Hispanics, more African Americans\u2014the Naval Academy has reaffirmed a fundamental American truth: that out of many, we are one. We see these values in every one of these Sailors and Marines, including those who have already served their country\u2014the dozens among you with prior enlisted service. ************ Honor. Courage. Commitment. These are the values that have defined your years in the Yard and that you\u2019ll need in the years ahead. As you join the fleet. As you lead Marines. As you confront the ever-changing threats of an ever-changing world. For history teaches us that the nations that grow comfortable with the old ways and complacent in the face of new threats\u2014those nations do not long endure. And in the 21st century, we do not have the luxury of deciding which challenges to prepare for and which to ignore. We must overcome the full spectrum of threats. The conventional and the unconventional. The nation-state and the terrorist network. The spread of deadly technologies and of hateful ideologies. Eighteenth century-style piracy and 21st century cyberthreats. ***************** Marines\u2014we need you to defeat the insurgent and the extremist. But we also need you to work with the tribal sheik and local leaders from Anbar to Kandahar who want to build a better future for their people. Naval aviators and flight officers\u2014we need you to dominate the airspace in times of conflict, but also to deliver food and medicine in times of humanitarian crisis. And surface warfare officers and submariners\u2014we need you to project American power across the vast oceans, but also to project American principles and values when you pull into that foreign port\u2014because for so many people around the world, you are the face of America. ************** Yesterday I visited the National Archives and the hall that holds our Constitution, Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. I went there because as our nation debates how to deal with the security challenges that we face, we must remember this enduring truth: the values and ideals in those documents are not simply words written into aging parchment, they are the bedrock of our liberty and our security. We uphold our fundamental principles and values not just because we choose to, but because we swear to. Not because they feel good, but because they help keep us safe. Because when America strays from our values, it not only undermines the rule of law, it alienates us from our allies, it energizes our adversaries and it endangers our national security and the lives of our troops. So as Americans, we reject the false chose between our security and our ideals. We can and we must and we will protect both. And that is just what you will pledge to do in a few moments when you raise your right hand and take your oath. By that simple act you will accept a life of great sacrifice. Long deployments. Separation for loved ones. Tests and trials that most Americans cannot imagine. But that is the oath you take, the life you choose, the promise you make to America. And, today, this is the promise I make to you. It\u2019s a promise that as long as I am your Commander in Chief, I will only send you into harm\u2019s way when it is absolutely necessary, and with the strategy, the well-defined goals, the equipment and the support you need to get the job done. This includes the job of bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end and pursuing a new comprehensive strategy to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. And to get you the support you need, we\u2019re enlisting all elements of our national power\u2014our diplomacy and development and our economic might and our moral suasion\u2014so that you and the rest of our military do not bear the burden of our security alone. We will also ensure you can meet the missions of today, which is why we\u2019ve halted reductions in Navy personnel and increased the size of the Marine Corps. And we will ensure you can meet the missions of tomorrow, which is why we\u2019re investing in the capabilities and technologies\u2014the littoral combat ships, the most advanced submarines and fighter aircraft\u2014so that you have what you need to succeed. In short, we will maintain America\u2019s military dominance and keep you the finest fighting force the world has ever seen. http://www.usna.edu/PAO/",

Because it\u2019s not the strength of our arms or the power of our technology that gives the United States our military dominance. It\u2019s our people. It\u2019s our Sailors and Marines, Soldiers and Airmen and Coast Guardsmen who perform brilliantly in every mission we give them. ************** This class is about to become the latest link in a long, unbroken chain of heroism and victory. A chain forged in battles whose names are etched in the stone of this stadium. From Coral Sea to Midway to Guadalcanal. From Iwo Jima to Inchon. From the Mekong Delta to Desert Storm. For some among us, these are not just places on a map. They are the stories of their lives. And we honor all our veterans here today. This chain of service calls to mind words that were spoken here in Annapolis on another spring day a century ago. The crowds assembled, the bands played, and the cannons roared. And as John Paul Jones\u2019 body was carried to the Yard, President Teddy Roosevelt spoke to the Midshipmen gathered there that day. \"Remember,\" he said, \"our words of admiration are but as sounding brass and tinkling symbols if we do not\u2026prepare to emulate their deeds.\" Emulate their deeds. That is what you are called upon to do. And in doing so these past four years, you have not only given meaning to your own lives, you serve as a reminder\u2014a challenge\u2014to your fellow Americans to fulfill the true meaning of citizenship. America, look at these young men and women. Look at these Sailors and Marines. Here are the values we cherish. Here are the ideals that endure. In an era when too few citizens answer the call to service\u2014to community or country\u2014these Americans chose to serve. And they did so in a time of war, knowing they might be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice. ************* In a culture where so many chase the outward markers of success that can so often lead us astray\u2014titles and status, materialism and money, fame and popularity\u2014these Americans have embraced the virtues that we need most right now. Self-discipline over self-interest. Work over comfort. Character over celebrity. After an era when so many institutions and individuals acted with such greed and recklessness, it is no wonder that our military remains the most trusted institution in the nation.

Congress raised military and VA benefits over the objections of the Republicans (as a group). Such being the case, what are you talking about?

When the US went to war in 1941, factories worked around the clock. I mean this literally. In THIS war, factories worked nine to five. No additional companies were hired. No overtime was suggested.

Penny wise and dollar foolish is why we are still there. To my mind it's all academic. Here's a short Editorial from the US Army's own \"Strategic Studies Institute.\" Mind you, not something I grabbed from Moveon dot org... quote: IN DEFENSE OF RATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Freier Strategic Studies Institute Risk in Webster\u2019s is \u201cthe possibility of suffering harm or loss.\u201d1 Risk accompanies both action and inaction. To strategists, it is accounted for and mitigated, but not always or even commonly avoided. To the national security strategist, risk\u2014to paraphrase the current defense strategy\u2014is the likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost in pursuit of key objectives. In this view, some goals are beyond reach. Others are within reach, but the cost of achieving them puts more important ambitions in some jeopardy.2 Unfortunately, those familiar with contemporary strategic-level military decisionmaking know that rational consideration of even the prospect of failure is absent. In high-level policy discussions, success is assumed. From the beginning, Iraq was an experiment in risk taking. To be sure, the war\u2019s advocates saw it as risk mitigation as well\u2014remember \u2018smoking guns\u2019 and \u2018mushroom clouds,\u2019 for example. However, at its core, toppling Saddam was about balancing the certainty of violent dislocation that accompanies overthrow of an unfavorable but stable status quo against the hope for a more favorable, future post-war political order. It was extension of \u201cthe democratic peace\u201d by force\u2014whether or not the forcible export of representative governance was ever a formal casus belli. In this context, Iraq engendered enormous risk from the beginning. There was the ever-present \u2018likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost\u2019 that needed to be accounted for in deliberate planning. For example, there were obvious dormant sectarian divisions. Given Saddam\u2019s violent separation of ruler from ruled, this indicated the distinct possibility of uncontrolled civil conflict in the aftermath of the government\u2019s collapse. There was the extant Iraqi overdependence on primary resource exports for government revenues. This, in the developing world (which Iraq rejoined from below in 2003), commonly signals persistent danger to political order. There was a certainty that at least two of Iraq\u2019s neighbors would actively resist through politics, influence, and at times, violence\u2014American success. Still others would be very sympathetic to Iraq\u2019s minority Sunni; if not quite hostile to Shi\u2019a or Kurdish triumph. Others still\u2014likely most\u2014would remain reticent on the issue of Iraq\u2019s democratic success or failure. Finally, there was the precedent of the Soviet Afghan War. In Afghanistan (circa 1979-89), external intervention was a magnet for Muslim anti-colonial resistance. Tribalism, nationalism, and Muslim extremism combined to militate against Soviet success. These same forces join today with internecine sectarianism to similarly check American progress in Iraq. Rational risk assessment in advance of the Iraq intervention would have identified and accounted for all of these. Each, after all\u2014individually or in combination, could be enough to seriously delay favorable outcomes, prevent success, or drive strategic costs to prohibitive levels. Evaluating each seriously, thoughtfully considering their implications, and accounting for them deliberately in strategy development is a sign of wisdom, not fear. Instead, those engineering the Iraq War framed strategic risk incorrectly. They assumed ultimate success\u2014a stable, representative, multifaith polity\u2014would rapidly and naturally occur as a result of the necessary but decidedly intermediate step of overthrowing the existing regime. Thus, in their view, the likelihood for some near-term \u201charm or loss\u201d was insignificant compared to the anticipated return on the nation\u2019s strategic investment. Their risk calculations simply never went beyond D-Day. It is now well-documented that Iraq policy was made in a strategic vacuum. It appears no vizier-like or mandarin-like class on the inside carefully weighed specific grand strategic options vis-\u00e0-vis the United States, Iraq, and the world in detail, calculating different choices and their inherent risks and benefits. There were prescient warnings. It is now clear few were heeded. In short, the risk problem, as it was likely presented to the President, was a strawman. It failed to account comprehensively for the real hazards engendered in deliberate regime destruction, stabilization, and reconstruction in a large, consequential state. Iraq proceeded from risk assessment that in its sophistication went little beyond \u201cnothing ventured nothing gained.\u201d This is a caution for the future. Risk-informed strategy does not indicate risk aversion. Identifying risks and hazards and accounting for their mitigation does not prevent action. Rather, it underwrites success. The bold too often mistake thoughtful consideration of real hazard for weakness. Quite the contrary, deliberate consideration of risk-adjusted choices increases the prospect for bold action\u2019s ultimate success. Riskinformed strategy provides decisionmakers with a realistic accounting of strategic conditions as they are, versus as some would prefer them to be. It proceeds from the conclusion that raw capacity and desire alone do not determine success. It recognizes that our perceptions of our motives and intentions are likely quite different from the perceptions of others. Finally, it demands that strategists account for both the prospect of failure and the progressive accumulation of excessive cost that\u2014without mitigation\u2014might jeopardize long-term success and the security of interests of equal or greater importance.

It was extension of \u201cthe democratic peace\u201d by force\u2014whether or not the forcible export of representative governance was ever a formal casus belli. In this context, Iraq engendered enormous risk from the beginning. There was the ever-present \u2018likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost\u2019 that needed to be accounted for in deliberate planning. For example, there were obvious dormant sectarian divisions. Given Saddam\u2019s violent separation of ruler from ruled, this indicated the distinct possibility of uncontrolled civil conflict in the aftermath of the government\u2019s collapse. There was the extant Iraqi overdependence on primary resource exports for government revenues. This, in the developing world (which Iraq rejoined from below in 2003), commonly signals persistent danger to political order. There was a certainty that at least two of Iraq\u2019s neighbors would actively resist through politics, influence, and at times, violence\u2014American success. Still others would be very sympathetic to Iraq\u2019s minority Sunni; if not quite hostile to Shi\u2019a or Kurdish triumph. Others still\u2014likely most\u2014would remain reticent on the issue of Iraq\u2019s democratic success or failure. Finally, there was the precedent of the Soviet Afghan War. In Afghanistan (circa 1979-89), external intervention was a magnet for Muslim anti-colonial resistance. Tribalism, nationalism, and Muslim extremism combined to militate against Soviet success. These same forces join today with internecine sectarianism to similarly check American progress in Iraq. Rational risk assessment in advance of the Iraq intervention would have identified and accounted for all of these. Each, after all\u2014individually or in combination, could be enough to seriously delay favorable outcomes, prevent success, or drive strategic costs to prohibitive levels. Evaluating each seriously, thoughtfully considering their implications, and accounting for them deliberately in strategy development is a sign of wisdom, not fear. Instead, those engineering the Iraq War framed strategic risk incorrectly. They assumed ultimate success\u2014a stable, representative, multifaith polity\u2014would rapidly and naturally occur as a result of the necessary but decidedly intermediate step of overthrowing the existing regime. Thus, in their view, the likelihood for some near-term \u201charm or loss\u201d was insignificant compared to the anticipated return on the nation\u2019s strategic investment. Their risk calculations simply never went beyond D-Day. It is now well-documented that Iraq policy was made in a strategic vacuum. It appears no vizier-like or mandarin-like class on the inside carefully weighed specific grand strategic options vis-\u00e0-vis the United States, Iraq, and the world in detail, calculating different choices and their inherent risks and benefits. There were prescient warnings. It is now clear few were heeded. In short, the risk problem, as it was likely presented to the President, was a strawman. It failed to account comprehensively for the real hazards engendered in deliberate regime destruction, stabilization, and reconstruction in a large, consequential state. Iraq proceeded from risk assessment that in its sophistication went little beyond \u201cnothing ventured nothing gained.\u201d This is a caution for the future. Risk-informed strategy does not indicate risk aversion. Identifying risks and hazards and accounting for their mitigation does not prevent action. Rather, it underwrites success. The bold too often mistake thoughtful consideration of real hazard for weakness. Quite the contrary, deliberate consideration of risk-adjusted choices increases the prospect for bold action\u2019s ultimate success. Riskinformed strategy provides decisionmakers with a realistic accounting of strategic conditions as they are, versus as some would prefer them to be. It proceeds from the conclusion that raw capacity and desire alone do not determine success. It recognizes that our perceptions of our motives and intentions are likely quite different from the perceptions of others. Finally, it demands that strategists account for both the prospect of failure and the progressive accumulation of excessive cost that\u2014without mitigation\u2014might jeopardize long-term success and the security of interests of equal or greater importance.

I did not know congress actually came through with \"every\" amount asked for from Bush, but I am happy to know you say they ended up giving it to him and then some. I actually do remember seeing the floor meetings with the two parties going at it over Iraq and wanting to bring our men and women home. Your memory IMO is so far correct. quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: I am sure you will correct me if I get it wrong..but it was more the Democratic party that had decided we never should have been at war with Iraq, then went on to call war crimes, to suggest Bush be removed from office, and finally to cut off his money as a way to get him to end that war, yes? Some Democrats suggested all of the above. Most Democrats suggested one or another of these acts. No one ever cut off any money. Impeachment (And I regret this) was never seriously on the table - Cutting off funds, even less so. Keep in mind that I can probably find a Republican advocating eating Muslims as a way to solve the World food problems (Perhaps I exagerate here... ) doesn't mean that this represents Republican thinking as a Party. quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: And it was more the Republican party that said, we went into Iraq based on intel from our country and others after being attacked on 9/11, we did not find what we were looking for but took Saddam out anyway who was an evil man, used Iraq as a base thinking Iran would be the big issue and we would have our people both in Afganistan and Irag to cover both sides of Iran, tried to bring freedom to the Iraq people, that ended up being harder than thought but because we did not cut and run when the liberals applied pressure at leeast the vote was a success, but at great cost to America, yes or no? President Bush wanted to invade Iraq long before he was even elected. 9/11 was the excuse. Did he believe Sadaam was an evil man? Sure he did. But there are a lot of evil men in this world. Did he believe that Iraq was an immenent threat to the United States? I doubt that. In fact, HE doubts that. Do I believe that Iraq was part of the WOT? Not a chance. Do I think that taking over Iraq lessened the power of Al Qaeda? I believed it prolonged Al Qaedas life. I believe it strenthed them in every possible way. And I also believe that we have created a new ally for Iran, and although Iran is not a part of the WOT, it does represent a long term threat to us, and we have helped them immensely without it costing them a dime. quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: When they were trying to force Bush in to ending the war on their time table wasn't it that that it was suggested that they would cut off his funds as a way to making him end the war? Some Democrats suggested that. Unfortunately they never came close to having enough votes to do this. quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: You don't remember seeing any of that? You never heard about that plan? I do. It would have been about the same time the media kept doing all the reports on how our men did not have the proper items needed to keep them safe. I think the tanks were a big issue, yes? \"You go to war with the army you have, not the army you want.\" Donald Rumsfeld quote: Originally posted by usa_girl: Was that called a hummer or humd? I don't remember exactly but I do remember watching that covered over and over because I was so upset that the military did not have what they needed to keep them safe. Oh yes, and something about a net you keep in the room while sleeping to protect against a bomb? I am sure I don't have it all exactly right, but that is why I am here to learn. When the US went to war in 1941, factories worked around the clock. I mean this literally. In THIS war, factories worked nine to five. No additional companies were hired. No overtime was suggested. It took more than four years for our troops to get the equipment that the military said we needed. Looked at objectively, this is unbelievable. The military in the form of the head of the Joint Chiefs, said point blank that we needed at least 200,000, better, 500,000 men to safely pacify the country and prevent an insurgency. For his trouble he was forced into retirement. I was against the war from the beginning, but if you're GOING to actually fight a war, don't do it on the cheap. Penny wise and dollar foolish is why we are still there. To my mind it's all academic. Here's a short Editorial from the US Army's own \"Strategic Studies Institute.\" Mind you, not something I grabbed from Moveon dot org... quote: IN DEFENSE OF RATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Freier Strategic Studies Institute Risk in Webster\u2019s is \u201cthe possibility of suffering harm or loss.\u201d1 Risk accompanies both action and inaction. To strategists, it is accounted for and mitigated, but not always or even commonly avoided. To the national security strategist, risk\u2014to paraphrase the current defense strategy\u2014is the likelihood of failure or prohibitive cost in pursuit of key objectives. In this view, some goals are beyond reach. Others are within reach, but the cost of achieving them puts more important ambitions in some jeopardy.2 Unfortunately, those familiar with contemporary strategic-level military decisionmaking know that rational consideration of even the prospect of failure is absent. In high-level policy discussions, success is assumed. From the beginning, Iraq was an experiment in risk taking. To be sure, the war\u2019s advocates saw it as risk mitigation as well\u2014remember \u2018smoking guns\u2019 and \u2018mushroom clouds,\u2019 for example.
