Do they bash on the kids and adults that send them letters and care packages? And do they always talk like that? For example, when the guy from Rolling Stones came. Please don't get me wrong, I have all the respect and appreciation for our military. I'm even thinking of enlisting myself, but when I see those things it just makes me think twice. Is that what it will be like?",

I understand though and just ask him to lighten up with it when he is around his younger brother. I remember coming home after my first 2 month patrol on a Coast Guard cutter. I was 19 and sitting at the table for dinner with my parents and brothers. \"Pass the F-ing potatoes, please.\" My parents just looked at me and didn't say a word. I apologized. It was just the way most people talked, not saying it was right. When people are around traumatic events, they deal with it in their own way. I remember being at a friend's BBQ, we were all cops of some kind. We'd get talking about a boating fatality like most people talk about sports. We looked back and the wives and girlfriends were horrified at how causual we were in talking about someone dying. If you do go into the service, just be yourself. If you can fight off turning out that way then great for you. No one has to be that way and I doubt anyone wants to. Like I said, often times it's just the way people deal with death. Good luck to you, Don Proud father of a US Marine, Cpl, AAV's",
