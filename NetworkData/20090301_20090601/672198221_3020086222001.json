ETA: Nobody wants to admit it, but in reality, states don't have rights. Example, the federal government likes to say that votor registration and elections or firearms laws are \"state's rights\" issues. However, that doesn't stop the federal government from continuing to \"monitor\" states that had a history of election issues 40 years ago or coming up with federal firearms restrictions. So, if states only have the rights that the federal government wants them to have, they don't have rights...they have priviledges.",

However, that doesn't stop the federal government from continuing to \"monitor\" states that had a history of election issues 40 years ago or coming up with federal firearms restrictions. So, if states only have the rights that the federal government wants them to have, they don't have rights...they have priviledges.",
