It is the best health care in the world because if you can afford it you can get it. Doctors are leaving in droves because of the huge increase in Medicaid/cair patients. The government makes it so difficult to get paid and under market value the docs cannot run the BUSINESS. Premiums going up is because people have the mentality that it is free. They get a pimple and they want three doctors to look at it. If that is WHAT they want to do then fine...but they will have to pay for it. If you lose your job do you lose your car insurance, house insurance, boater insurance? Why is health care tied to your job? You think you are getting a deal on it? 47% of health care is operated by the gov. millions of illegal\u2019s get free health care. millions who can afford health care do not care to. Do your homework quote: Contrary to right-wingers popular belief, noone is advocating that type of health care reform. In fact, people will be able to keep their current coverage if they so choose. That is soooooo far from the truth it is in another solar system. You WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD the current coverage because the SUPPLY is going to DISAPPEAR. Use common sense. If you own a car repair shop and the gov said...you can only charge so much to paint that, cut this, fix that you would go into a more lucrative business. You do that there are less hospitals, doctors offices, on and on. The costs go up the lines get longer. Nancy P will be able to afford it but I will not. The only way to keep costs down on government ran health care is to ration it! That is it. No other options. You either ration the costs, the volume, or the form of treatment. We have a limited amount of dollars as a GDP. There is no other way. The play book they are following is Daschle\u2019s among others...that is why they wanted him so bad. And they stated that they wanted him because he is the only one who knows healthcare as well as he does Health care is already rationed by the insurance companies. They decide who they will cover, what they will cover and how much they will pay.",
