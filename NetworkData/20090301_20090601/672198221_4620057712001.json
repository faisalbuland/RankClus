A weaker dollar would erode the value of those assets. \"Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be honest, I'm a little bit worried,\" Wen said at a news conference Friday after the closing of China's annual legislative session. \"I would like to call on the United States to honor its words, stay a credible nation and ensure the safety of Chinese assets.\" The appeal suggested the outlines of Chinese President Hu Jintao's stance when he meets with President Barack Obama at an April 2 summit in London of the Group of 20 major economies on possible remedies for the global crisis. Wen gave no indication whether Beijing wants changes in U.S. policy. But economists said his comments reflect fears that higher U.S. budget deficits from Washington's $787 billion stimulus package could drive down the dollar and the value of China's Treasury notes. \"China is telling the U.S. to be careful, not to overspend and keep an eye on the dollar,\" said Kelvin Lau, regional economist at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. \"There are risks that China cannot control, so they're depending on the U.S. to maintain fiscal prudence and keep the dollar reasonably stable.\" Yeah, their buddies are telling them what to do. Knew BHO couldn't do this. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
