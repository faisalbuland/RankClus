All of what you say would be true, if this guy was an American, with the best interests of the country at heart - But he's a Democrat, and as Rush tells me, he was there to work with his terrorist allies - But they simply don't appreciate his willingness to surrender to them. Of course Congress will soon be voting on questions about this part of the world - We should tell them to stay in Washington, say their prayers, trust whatever the President tells them, and STFU! This is basically what Mr. Bush told Congress, and it's only fair that Mr. Obama be able to tell them the same thing. Some might whine and snivel that the President has too much power already.

This is basically what Mr. Bush told Congress, and it's only fair that Mr. Obama be able to tell them the same thing. Some might whine and snivel that the President has too much power already.
