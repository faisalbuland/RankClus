Osnabr\u00fcck/Passau - The Federal Government has agreed upon a tougher stance against piracy, the coalition's leading lawmaker for domestic politics, Hans-Peter Uhl (CSU) has said. \"From now on pirates will be fought will all military and police means, including the deployment of anti-terrorism units\", Mr. Uhl told the \"Neue Osnabr\u00fccker Zeitung\" newspaper. Pirates still have restrained the German freighter \"Hansa Stavanger\", with five German citizens and 19 other sailors onboard. According to word that has reached SPIEGEL, the GSG9 counter terrorism unit was scheduled to free the hostages at the very beginning of the siege - however the liberation was cancelled. \"We think when pirates strike there can be only one appropriate answer: The ships of the pirates must be sunken immediately\", Mr. Uhl said. Now the German Navy would need to use their firepower, because \"further diffidence just makes the German state look silly\". Also resolute deployments of special forces to recapture hijacked ships and frighten off pirates were called necessary.
