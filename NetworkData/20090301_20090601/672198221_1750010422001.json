The F-22 can turn and burn with the best of them! The Rator has yet to fire in anger, let's hope not but if has to I'm sure with the right pilot in the cockpit, the USAF will come out on top! The price for the new bird is high, maybe if it was built at just one or two plants and in greater numbers to offset the high cost, I'm sure it won't be as costly to the US tax payer. Politics and bureaucratic bumbling have a way of really dragging down America's and the US Air Force's true potential. I can only imagine the bickering and critisims had the YF-23 Blackwidow II made into full production as well! Just my two cents on the subject! -Max Brandt",
