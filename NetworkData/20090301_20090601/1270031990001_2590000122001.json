Well, let me reproduce it for you, in full: quote: \"In God We Still Trust\" by Diamond Rio You place your hand on His bible, when you swear to tell the truth. His name is on our greatest monuments and all our money too. An' when we pledge allegiance, there's no doubt where we stand: There's no separation, we're one nation under Him. In God, We Still Trust, Here in America, He's the one we turn to every time the going gets rough. He is the source of all our strength, The one who watches over us. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Now there are those among us, Who wanna push Him out. And erase his name from everything, This country's all about. From the schoolhouse to the courthouse, They're silencing His word, An' now it's time for all believers, To make our voices heard. In God, We Still Trust, here in America, He's the one we turn to every time the goin' gets rough. He is the source of all our strength, the one who watches over us. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America, Here in America, Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America. This is CLEARLY a Christian song, not just a \"generally religious\" song. It's clearly indoctrinating the idea that we are a Christian nation, and that in order to be American, you have to be Christian. This particular line is painfully telling: \"There's no separation, we're one nation under Him.\" They wanted to teach this and have third graders sing it in a public elementary school in Florida. If I was a parent of a child at that school, and my kid came home singing that garbage, I'd be furious. I'm glad they put a stop to it.",

It seems to me, the last time I was in court, I didn't have to swear upon a bible if I didn't want to. I was provided the option to simply affirm, but that might be in the statement itself. If it is required to use the Holy Bible, that is an infringement on the Constitution of the United States. Who here is sworn to uphold and defend this?

In my grade school, in the United States of America, if the music teacher wanted us to sing a song, and it were \"Christian Biased\", and say, a girl named Jay was a Jehovah's Witness, she would simply tell the teacher that the song was in violation of her family's religious practices and would thereby be exempt from having to sing the song. This applied to Christmas Carols, as Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas. How hard is that? Well, I will tell you. The children who were Jehovah's Witnesses felt alienated when the other children sang Christmas Carols. They looked kind of disappointed too. What is the solution??

But, it seems that maybe you do not fully understand the concept of establishment. If the school had been allowed to mandate that the song is performed, and those who do not wish to sing it, are excluded, then the school has in effect established a preference for christianity (since the song references the bible). Since the school is an agent of the government, by establishing a preference for religion, it has run afoul of the Constitution, and the SCOTUS rulings prohibiting it. No misunderstanding there. There are several SCOTUS rulings establishing the separation of church and state, which support this judges ruling. Here are a few for you to reference. -McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948) - Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional. -Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962) - Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion. -Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional and Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional. -Epperson v. Arkansas, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968) - State statue banning teaching of evolution is unconstitutional. A state cannot alter any element in a course of study in order to promote a religious point of view. A state's attempt to hide behind a nonreligious motivation will not be given credence unless that state can show a secular reason as the foundation for its actions. -Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971) - Established the three part test for determining if an action of government violates First Amendment's separation of church and state: 1) the government action must have a secular purpose; 2) its primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance religion; 3) there must be no excessive entanglement between government and religion. -Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) - Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional. -Wallace v. Jaffree, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985) - State's moment of silence at public school statute is unconstitutional where legislative record reveals that motivation for statute was the encouragement of prayer. Court majority silent on whether \"pure\" moment of silence scheme, with no bias in favor of prayer or any other mental process, would be constitutional. -Edwards v. Aquillard, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987) - Unconstitutional for state to require teaching of \"creation science\" in all instances in which evolution is taught. Statute had a clear religious motivation. -Lee v. Weisman, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) - Unconstitutional for a school district to provide any clergy to perform nondenominational prayer at elementary or secondary school graduation.

Just because many cannot understand what the establishment clause was meant to prevent (a federal church, like the Church of England, with powers to match) and the free exercise was to prevent making other religions illegal (again, like in England when practicing religions other than the state approved one was a crime) Yes, the First Amendment was meant to prevent the establishment of a national church/religion. But, it seems that maybe you do not fully understand the concept of establishment. If the school had been allowed to mandate that the song is performed, and those who do not wish to sing it, are excluded, then the school has in effect established a preference for christianity (since the song references the bible). Since the school is an agent of the government, by establishing a preference for religion, it has run afoul of the Constitution, and the SCOTUS rulings prohibiting it. No misunderstanding there. There are several SCOTUS rulings establishing the separation of church and state, which support this judges ruling. Here are a few for you to reference. -McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948) - Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional. -Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962) - Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion. -Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional and Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional. -Epperson v. Arkansas, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968) - State statue banning teaching of evolution is unconstitutional. A state cannot alter any element in a course of study in order to promote a religious point of view. A state's attempt to hide behind a nonreligious motivation will not be given credence unless that state can show a secular reason as the foundation for its actions. -Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971) - Established the three part test for determining if an action of government violates First Amendment's separation of church and state: 1) the government action must have a secular purpose; 2) its primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance religion; 3) there must be no excessive entanglement between government and religion. -Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) - Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional. -Wallace v. Jaffree, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985) - State's moment of silence at public school statute is unconstitutional where legislative record reveals that motivation for statute was the encouragement of prayer. Court majority silent on whether \"pure\" moment of silence scheme, with no bias in favor of prayer or any other mental process, would be constitutional. -Edwards v. Aquillard, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987) - Unconstitutional for state to require teaching of \"creation science\" in all instances in which evolution is taught. Statute had a clear religious motivation. -Lee v. Weisman, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) - Unconstitutional for a school district to provide any clergy to perform nondenominational prayer at elementary or secondary school graduation. It involves government sponsorship of worship. Court majority was particularly concerned about psychological coercion to which children, as opposed to adults, would be subjected, by having prayers that may violate their beliefs recited at their graduation ceremonies. quote: Originally posted by STDog: Lastly, read the letter where Jefferson use the \"wall of separation\" phrase, a letter to a Connecticut Baptist Association, and you see that he meant that the government would not interfere with the church.

It's clearly indoctrinating the idea that we are a Christian nation, and that in order to be American, you have to be Christian.

It seems to me, the last time I was in court, I didn't have to swear upon a bible if I didn't want to. I was provided the option to simply affirm, but that might be in the statement itself. If it is required to use the Holy Bible, that is an infringement on the Constitution of the United States. Who here is sworn to uphold and defend this?

Okay, so it's alright for a big person to break the law, but not a kid?? I never said it wasn't a \"religious song\", it is, in this sense, no different than forcing children to pray. When I was in grade school, I don't think we sang hymns in music class, but there might have been a couple of songs which were Christian biased. Nobody complained, if we did. In my grade school, in the United States of America, if the music teacher wanted us to sing a song, and it were \"Christian Biased\", and say, a girl named Jay was a Jehovah's Witness, she would simply tell the teacher that the song was in violation of her family's religious practices and would thereby be exempt from having to sing the song. This applied to Christmas Carols, as Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas. How hard is that? Well, I will tell you. The children who were Jehovah's Witnesses felt alienated when the other children sang Christmas Carols. They looked kind of disappointed too. What is the solution?? The separation of the church and state should probably apply to school function. It is, however, an entity of the state. Of course, this would be the \"letter of the law\".

But, it seems that maybe you do not fully understand the concept of establishment. If the school had been allowed to mandate that the song is performed, and those who do not wish to sing it, are excluded, then the school has in effect established a preference for christianity (since the song references the bible). Since the school is an agent of the government, by establishing a preference for religion, it has run afoul of the Constitution, and the SCOTUS rulings prohibiting it. No misunderstanding there. There are several SCOTUS rulings establishing the separation of church and state, which support this judges ruling. Here are a few for you to reference. -McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948) - Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional. -Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962) - Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion. -Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional and Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional. -Epperson v. Arkansas, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968) - State statue banning teaching of evolution is unconstitutional. A state cannot alter any element in a course of study in order to promote a religious point of view. A state's attempt to hide behind a nonreligious motivation will not be given credence unless that state can show a secular reason as the foundation for its actions. -Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971) - Established the three part test for determining if an action of government violates First Amendment's separation of church and state: 1) the government action must have a secular purpose; 2) its primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance religion; 3) there must be no excessive entanglement between government and religion. -Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) - Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional. -Wallace v. Jaffree, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985) - State's moment of silence at public school statute is unconstitutional where legislative record reveals that motivation for statute was the encouragement of prayer. Court majority silent on whether \"pure\" moment of silence scheme, with no bias in favor of prayer or any other mental process, would be constitutional. -Edwards v. Aquillard, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987) - Unconstitutional for state to require teaching of \"creation science\" in all instances in which evolution is taught. Statute had a clear religious motivation. -Lee v. Weisman, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) - Unconstitutional for a school district to provide any clergy to perform nondenominational prayer at elementary or secondary school graduation. It involves government sponsorship of worship. Court majority was particularly concerned about psychological coercion to which children, as opposed to adults, would be subjected, by having prayers that may violate their beliefs recited at their graduation ceremonies. quote: Originally posted by STDog: Lastly, read the letter where Jefferson use the \"wall of separation\" phrase, a letter to a Connecticut Baptist Association, and you see that he meant that the government would not interfere with the church.

Where exactly dose the 1st Amnd. promise such separation? Just because many cannot understand what the establishment clause was meant to prevent (a federal church, like the Church of England, with powers to match) and the free exercise was to prevent making other religions illegal (again, like in England when practicing religions other than the state approved one was a crime) Lastly, read the letter where Jefferson use the \"wall of separation\" phrase, a letter to a Connecticut Baptist Association, and you see that he meant that the government would not interfere with the church. That letter was obscure and little known until the 20th century when it was taken out of context by those wanting to remove religion from the public sphere. Let's get crazy and say for a second that you're assumptions are right: that the first amendment doesn't prohibit preaching and singing religious tunes in grade school, but only is indeed there to prevent a national church from taking over. What do you think a national church would consist of? Wouldn't one of the qualifiers be the indoctrination of children into a belief, however general... just as the songs and preachings and religious teachings attempt to do? Let's also assume for an impossible instant that I'm wrong and that it's okie dokie per the Constitution and Bill of Rights to let children sing Silent Night, pray before school, listen to sermons at school, etc. This, of course, will make the other religions and atheists feel excluded, and by that measure it's a divisive thing to do, very biased and segregationist. This being the case, wouldn't it behoove us to amend the Constitution so that this were no longer so? I doubt that the framers ever dreamed that their document was perfect. That's why it's been such a fluid device all these decades. And that's why you hear things like Jefferson and judges clarifying it as a document maintaining separation of church and state. It's the only fair thing to do. There's been a lot more discussion about this sort of thing in the last twenty years than the previous twenty. Then, for a couple of decades before that, there was a previous wave of disagreement, culminating in the dominant school of thought seeing to it that the Pledge, etc., contained a bit of God with Old Glory.

It seems we are going to woo the fools in Cuba now, maybe it will be Raul or Fidel before he dies as the proper obeisance that will be declared for you before they issue you the cute little blue helmets, in place of what ever you happen to be issued now. After all the apologies are made, who will you be tasked to serve?? God?? That's a hoot!!! He has been cast into disfavor along with American soveriegnty and your freedoms, so I guess it doesn't really matter does it?? This whole discussion is among the few in the beginning of futility. The cute part is you are arguing the price of eggs as the whole world changes around you...now THAT'S a hoot!!!

It seems to me, the last time I was in court, I didn't have to swear upon a bible if I didn't want to. I was provided the option to simply affirm, but that might be in the statement itself. If it is required to use the Holy Bible, that is an infringement on the Constitution of the United States. Who here is sworn to uphold and defend this? It is kind of weird to me to see this thread directed towards the lack of support of having that song in grade school. It looks like a turn in the tide or something.

Just because many cannot understand what the establishment clause was meant to prevent (a federal church, like the Church of England, with powers to match) and the free exercise was to prevent making other religions illegal (again, like in England when practicing religions other than the state approved one was a crime) Yes, the First Amendment was meant to prevent the establishment of a national church/religion. But, it seems that maybe you do not fully understand the concept of establishment. If the school had been allowed to mandate that the song is performed, and those who do not wish to sing it, are excluded, then the school has in effect established a preference for christianity (since the song references the bible). Since the school is an agent of the government, by establishing a preference for religion, it has run afoul of the Constitution, and the SCOTUS rulings prohibiting it. No misunderstanding there. There are several SCOTUS rulings establishing the separation of church and state, which support this judges ruling. Here are a few for you to reference. -McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948) - Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional. -Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962) - Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion. -Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional and Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional. -Epperson v. Arkansas, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968) - State statue banning teaching of evolution is unconstitutional. A state cannot alter any element in a course of study in order to promote a religious point of view. A state's attempt to hide behind a nonreligious motivation will not be given credence unless that state can show a secular reason as the foundation for its actions. -Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971) - Established the three part test for determining if an action of government violates First Amendment's separation of church and state: 1) the government action must have a secular purpose; 2) its primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance religion; 3) there must be no excessive entanglement between government and religion. -Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) - Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional. -Wallace v. Jaffree, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985) - State's moment of silence at public school statute is unconstitutional where legislative record reveals that motivation for statute was the encouragement of prayer. Court majority silent on whether \"pure\" moment of silence scheme, with no bias in favor of prayer or any other mental process, would be constitutional. -Edwards v. Aquillard, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987) - Unconstitutional for state to require teaching of \"creation science\" in all instances in which evolution is taught. Statute had a clear religious motivation. -Lee v. Weisman, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) - Unconstitutional for a school district to provide any clergy to perform nondenominational prayer at elementary or secondary school graduation. It involves government sponsorship of worship. Court majority was particularly concerned about psychological coercion to which children, as opposed to adults, would be subjected, by having prayers that may violate their beliefs recited at their graduation ceremonies. quote: Originally posted by STDog: Lastly, read the letter where Jefferson use the \"wall of separation\" phrase, a letter to a Connecticut Baptist Association, and you see that he meant that the government would not interfere with the church.

        "quote": "Originally posted by Whirled_Peas: No, not the phrase on the money - the song. And no, not banned completely - just banned from being taught in Public School. What's wrong with the song? Well, let me reproduce it for you, in full: quote: \"In God We Still Trust\" by Diamond Rio You place your hand on His bible, when you swear to tell the truth. His name is on our greatest monuments and all our money too. An' when we pledge allegiance, there's no doubt where we stand: There's no separation, we're one nation under Him. In God, We Still Trust, Here in America, He's the one we turn to every time the going gets rough. He is the source of all our strength, The one who watches over us. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Now there are those among us, Who wanna push Him out. And erase his name from everything, This country's all about. From the schoolhouse to the courthouse, They're silencing His word, An' now it's time for all believers, To make our voices heard. In God, We Still Trust, here in America, He's the one we turn to every time the goin' gets rough. He is the source of all our strength, the one who watches over us. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America, Here in America, Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America. This is CLEARLY a Christian song, not just a \"generally religious\" song. It's clearly indoctrinating the idea that we are a Christian nation, and that in order to be American, you have to be Christian. This particular line is painfully telling: \"There's no separation, we're one nation under Him.\" They wanted to teach this and have third graders sing it in a public elementary school in Florida. If I was a parent of a child at that school, and my kid came home singing that garbage, I'd be furious.[Then enroll your kid in anti-Christian school.] I'm glad they put a stop to it.[The deep feelings and emotions and faith of so many who believe its words will see to it that a so-called \"ban\" will remain only the ineffective censorship it is.

In my grade school, in the United States of America, if the music teacher wanted us to sing a song, and it were \"Christian Biased\", and say, a girl named Jay was a Jehovah's Witness, she would simply tell the teacher that the song was in violation of her family's religious practices and would thereby be exempt from having to sing the song.

Schlesinger also said, despite the school\u2019s voluntary removal of the song, the teachers had already infringed on the students\u2019 First Amendment rights and caused \u201cirreparable injury.\u201d \u201cThese lyrics endorse a specific viewpoint of preference for religious sectarianism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFurther\u2026this song antagonizes and degrades those whose beliefs differ from the ones espoused by its lyrics. \u2026\u201d",

Just because many cannot understand what the establishment clause was meant to prevent (a federal church, like the Church of England, with powers to match) and the free exercise was to prevent making other religions illegal (again, like in England when practicing religions other than the state approved one was a crime) Yes, the First Amendment was meant to prevent the establishment of a national church/religion. But, it seems that maybe you do not fully understand the concept of establishment. If the school had been allowed to mandate that the song is performed, and those who do not wish to sing it, are excluded, then the school has in effect established a preference for christianity (since the song references the bible). Since the school is an agent of the government, by establishing a preference for religion, it has run afoul of the Constitution, and the SCOTUS rulings prohibiting it. No misunderstanding there. There are several SCOTUS rulings establishing the separation of church and state, which support this judges ruling. Here are a few for you to reference. -McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948) - Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional. -Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962) - Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion. -Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional and Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional. -Epperson v. Arkansas, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968) - State statue banning teaching of evolution is unconstitutional. A state cannot alter any element in a course of study in order to promote a religious point of view. A state's attempt to hide behind a nonreligious motivation will not be given credence unless that state can show a secular reason as the foundation for its actions. -Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971) - Established the three part test for determining if an action of government violates First Amendment's separation of church and state: 1) the government action must have a secular purpose; 2) its primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance religion; 3) there must be no excessive entanglement between government and religion. -Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) - Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional. -Wallace v. Jaffree, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985) - State's moment of silence at public school statute is unconstitutional where legislative record reveals that motivation for statute was the encouragement of prayer. Court majority silent on whether \"pure\" moment of silence scheme, with no bias in favor of prayer or any other mental process, would be constitutional. -Edwards v. Aquillard, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987) - Unconstitutional for state to require teaching of \"creation science\" in all instances in which evolution is taught. Statute had a clear religious motivation. -Lee v. Weisman, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) - Unconstitutional for a school district to provide any clergy to perform nondenominational prayer at elementary or secondary school graduation. It involves government sponsorship of worship.

In all that time, there was never in the whole friggin' city, ONE kid killed in a Chicago school. There was discipline and reform school available for your sorry self if you screwed up bad enough. Also even miserable little Shiites like me understood, that people had value because we learned it in Sunday school if no flippin' where else!! Give a harness bull (cop, to you rubes) a ration of crap and you got stuffed up your own azz!! Then came the marvelous seventies, when the insane were given control of the asylums by the intellegentsia who abdicated their positions of responsibility in favor of their combined liberal guilt for their success in life!! The dumbing down of our youth began then and continues today, to the point to where they are no longer employable with just a high school education and just barely so with an associates degree in some field!! Now you tell me oh revered ones of higher intellect, what the farg is wrong with this picture????!! Why are our kids killing each other in schools, beating teachers half to death, shooting others, rebelling at any and all forms of discipline. From the time they enter school half of them have been drugged to relieve them of their Hyperactivity Attention Deficit Disorder....what used to be fixed by giving them a crack in the azz and telling them to SIT DOWN and SHUT UP or they were going to be so frigging gone, nobody would remember their name!!! Now when the class size is over twenty kids there is a teachers assistant in the room then there are the special ed assistants in the classes that are constantly disrupted by these who are incapable of learning in \"normal\" surroundings and the regulsar kids have to pay with their own educations for this crap!!! And, before anybody jumps my crap, my brother Mike was a special ed kid way back then and went to a separate school till high school, by then he had caught up and did well from then on!! They got an education then too!! O.K. libs....or should I say \"progressives\" ( that's a hoot!!!) What is your answer?? What are your solutions??? You've been running the asylum now for the last forty years and bringing all these improvements, what are ya gonna do??? Hold a candlelight vigil...oh yeah!! That's real damned effective!! How about grief counsellors for the survivors of what ever holocause visits a school near you next week?? Or I know, let's all hold a sit in that's always effective as well!! How about a march that always gets em feelin' like they REALLY did something don't it!! We're all waiting for your well considered answers, come on rescue us!!!",

        "reply": "I grew up on one of the roughest areas of the country, as a kid I was a rotten little bas****!! I was in fights at least twice a week almost all the time I was in school, mostly because of the flack I took over the surplus clothes I wore. In all that time, there was never in the whole friggin' city, ONE kid killed in a Chicago school. There was discipline and reform school available for your sorry self if you screwed up bad enough. Also even miserable little Shiites like me understood, that people had value because we learned it in Sunday school if no flippin' where else!! Give a harness bull (cop, to you rubes) a ration of crap and you got stuffed up your own azz!! Then came the marvelous seventies, when the insane were given control of the asylums by the intellegentsia who abdicated their positions of responsibility in favor of their combined liberal guilt for their success in life!! The dumbing down of our youth began then and continues today, to the point to where they are no longer employable with just a high school education and just barely so with an associates degree in some field!! Now you tell me oh revered ones of higher intellect, what the farg is wrong with this picture????!! Why are our kids killing each other in schools, beating teachers half to death, shooting others, rebelling at any and all forms of discipline. From the time they enter school half of them have been drugged to relieve them of their Hyperactivity Attention Deficit Disorder....what used to be fixed by giving them a crack in the azz and telling them to SIT DOWN and SHUT UP or they were going to be so frigging gone, nobody would remember their name!!! Now when the class size is over twenty kids there is a teachers assistant in the room then there are the special ed assistants in the classes that are constantly disrupted by these who are incapable of learning in \"normal\" surroundings and the regulsar kids have to pay with their own educations for this crap!!! And, before anybody jumps my crap, my brother Mike was a special ed kid way back then and went to a separate school till high school, by then he had caught up and did well from then on!! They got an education then too!! O.K. libs....or should I say \"progressives\" ( that's a hoot!!!) What is your answer?? What are your solutions??? You've been running the asylum now for the last forty years and bringing all these improvements, what are ya gonna do??? Hold a candlelight vigil...oh yeah!! That's real damned effective!! How about grief counsellors for the survivors of what ever holocause visits a school near you next week?? Or I know, let's all hold a sit in that's always effective as well!! How about a march that always gets em feelin' like they REALLY did something don't it!! We're all waiting for your well considered answers, come on rescue us!!!",

Well, let me reproduce it for you, in full: quote: \"In God We Still Trust\" by Diamond Rio You place your hand on His bible, when you swear to tell the truth. His name is on our greatest monuments and all our money too. An' when we pledge allegiance, there's no doubt where we stand: There's no separation, we're one nation under Him. In God, We Still Trust, Here in America, He's the one we turn to every time the going gets rough. He is the source of all our strength, The one who watches over us. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Now there are those among us, Who wanna push Him out. And erase his name from everything, This country's all about. From the schoolhouse to the courthouse, They're silencing His word, An' now it's time for all believers, To make our voices heard. In God, We Still Trust, here in America, He's the one we turn to every time the goin' gets rough. He is the source of all our strength, the one who watches over us. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America, Here in America, Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America, in God, we still trust. Here in America. This is CLEARLY a Christian song, not just a \"generally religious\" song. It's clearly indoctrinating the idea that we are a Christian nation, and that in order to be American, you have to be Christian. This particular line is painfully telling: \"There's no separation, we're one nation under Him.\" They wanted to teach this and have third graders sing it in a public elementary school in Florida. If I was a parent of a child at that school, and my kid came home singing that garbage, I'd be furious. I'm glad they put a stop to it.",

And why should those who oppose religious indoctrination have to enroll OUR kids in a different school? Public schools are supposed to be secular. Now if YOU wish YOUR kids to have a religious education, enroll them in a religious school. Us lemmings? No, you are part of the blind sheep.",

It seems to me, the last time I was in court, I didn't have to swear upon a bible if I didn't want to. I was provided the option to simply affirm, but that might be in the statement itself. If it is required to use the Holy Bible, that is an infringement on the Constitution of the United States. Who here is sworn to uphold and defend this?

If the school had been allowed to mandate that the song is performed, and those who do not wish to sing it, are excluded, then the school has in effect established a preference for christianity (since the song references the bible). Since the school is an agent of the government, by establishing a preference for religion, it has run afoul of the Constitution, and the SCOTUS rulings prohibiting it. No misunderstanding there. There are several SCOTUS rulings establishing the separation of church and state, which support this judges ruling. Here are a few for you to reference. -McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948) - Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional. -Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962) - Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion. -Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional and Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional. -Epperson v. Arkansas, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968) - State statue banning teaching of evolution is unconstitutional. A state cannot alter any element in a course of study in order to promote a religious point of view. A state's attempt to hide behind a nonreligious motivation will not be given credence unless that state can show a secular reason as the foundation for its actions. -Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971) - Established the three part test for determining if an action of government violates First Amendment's separation of church and state: 1) the government action must have a secular purpose; 2) its primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance religion; 3) there must be no excessive entanglement between government and religion. -Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) - Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional. -Wallace v. Jaffree, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985) - State's moment of silence at public school statute is unconstitutional where legislative record reveals that motivation for statute was the encouragement of prayer. Court majority silent on whether \"pure\" moment of silence scheme, with no bias in favor of prayer or any other mental process, would be constitutional. -Edwards v. Aquillard, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987) - Unconstitutional for state to require teaching of \"creation science\" in all instances in which evolution is taught. Statute had a clear religious motivation. -Lee v. Weisman, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) - Unconstitutional for a school district to provide any clergy to perform nondenominational prayer at elementary or secondary school graduation. It involves government sponsorship of worship. Court majority was particularly concerned about psychological coercion to which children, as opposed to adults, would be subjected, by having prayers that may violate their beliefs recited at their graduation ceremonies. quote: Originally posted by STDog: Lastly, read the letter where Jefferson use the \"wall of separation\" phrase, a letter to a Connecticut Baptist Association, and you see that he meant that the government would not interfere with the church.
