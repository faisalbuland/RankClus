In a letter to the secretary general of the United Nations, the 16 signatories, including Richard Goldstone, a former chief prosecutor for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said both sides in the conflict had allegations to answer for and needed to be held to account. \"Allegations of serious violations of the laws of war have emerged throughout the latest Gaza conflict, relating to conduct and actions by both the Israeli military and by the Palestinian armed groups,\" the letter says. \"Without setting the record straight in a credible and impartial manner, it will be difficult for those communities that have borne the heavy cost of violence to move beyond the terrible aftermath of conflict. \"A prompt, independent and impartial investigation would provide a public record of gross violations of international humanitarian law committed and provide recommendations on how those responsible for crimes should be held to account.\" Israel launched a three-week offensive in Gaza on Dec. 27, 2008, saying the land, sea and aerial attack was designed to put a stop to the firing of rockets across the border into southern Israel by militant groups, including Hamas.

That's nine years ago and yet no one assigns responsibility to the originator of the latest version of death and destruction. Camp David Summit I cannot possibly imagine why Arafat would refuse below terms! -73% of the West Bank (27% less than the 1993 agreed Green Line borders) -Refugees (some 700,000) would not be allowed to return to (their homes) in present day Israel! -West Bank would be separated by a road from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea Palestinians would have free passage, at Israeli discretion of course. -Give up Jerusalem in exchange for \u201csurrounding villages\u201d. -Israeli Early warning stations inside the Palestinian state -Israeli control of Palestinian airspace -The right of Israel to deploy troops in the Palestinian state -Palestinian state was to be demilitarized So, how was their situation going to change from what it is now? What concessions was Israel planing on making? Camp David Summit was equivalent to buying a car at the dealership! Car is worth $20,000 but when you get there it\u2019s priced at $24,000; hence you spend the next 3 hours talking them down to $20,000.....dealer gets what he originaly wanted without any compromise, and the buyer gets the illusion of a \u201cgetting a great deal\u201d!

Being able to read since the age of five I understand what your link was saying, but they have only one they would prosecute or take action against. As you know the UN is the harbor of propaganda and venue to harass Israel. That\u2019s your story and you\u2019re sticking to it? The entire world is out to get them!? Not to mention being a dark cloud over the mideast keeping Palestine in the 10th century. Not only the US but Europe and even Russia has spent time and money trying aid this region. Recent evidence of the big guns in the neighborhood accepting an equal place at the table and not dictating as the leader of Arab league shows promise. Second part of the equation, by nullifying Israel right to defend themselves and holding military upgrades you're not only putting them at risk but the many Arab nations that we supply more goods and revenue also. They would be subject to being inferior to neighbors as Somalia, Rwanda, and unfriendlies like Iran or Zimbabwee. Or , limiting the Jew/Arab population of Israel as a subservient? Not very well thought out plan on someones part. The two State theory was first floated by a guy named Bill. President Clinton suggested this publicly for the first time and was shot down by not only the opposition but his party. Finally, the idea caught on he busted his butt on pulling it off but the little ratfink Arafat was already planning infatada dos. That's nine years ago and yet no one assigns responsibility to the originator of the latest version of death and destruction. Camp David Summit I cannot possibly imagine why Arafat would refuse below terms! -73% of the West Bank (27% less than the 1993 agreed Green Line borders) -Refugees (some 700,000) would not be allowed to return to (their homes) in present day Israel! -West Bank would be separated by a road from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea Palestinians would have free passage, at Israeli discretion of course. -Give up Jerusalem in exchange for \u201csurrounding villages\u201d. -Israeli Early warning stations inside the Palestinian state -Israeli control of Palestinian airspace -The right of Israel to deploy troops in the Palestinian state -Palestinian state was to be demilitarized So, how was their situation going to change from what it is now? What concessions was Israel planing on making?", 
        "reply": " Camp David Summit was equivalent to buying a car at the dealership! Car is worth $20,000 but when you get there it\u2019s priced at $24,000; hence you spend the next 3 hours talking them down to $20,000.....dealer gets what he originaly wanted without any compromise, and the buyer gets the illusion of a \u201cgetting a great deal\u201d!

Camp David Summit I cannot possibly imagine why Arafat would refuse below terms! -73% of the West Bank (27% less than the 1993 agreed Green Line borders) -Refugees (some 700,000) would not be allowed to return to (their homes) in present day Israel! -West Bank would be separated by a road from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea Palestinians would have free passage, at Israeli discretion of course. -Give up Jerusalem in exchange for \u201csurrounding villages\u201d. -Israeli Early warning stations inside the Palestinian state -Israeli control of Palestinian airspace -The right of Israel to deploy troops in the Palestinian state -Palestinian state was to be demilitarized So, how was their situation going to change from what it is now? What concessions was Israel planing on making? Camp David Summit was equivalent to buying a car at the dealership! Car is worth $20,000 but when you get there it\u2019s priced at $24,000; hence you spend the next 3 hours talking them down to $20,000.....dealer gets what he originaly wanted without any compromise, and the buyer gets the illusion of a \u201cgetting a great deal\u201d!
