What would be the technology needed or problems encountered in making this telescope a part of the International Space Station (ISS)? Or is there some other reason that the Space stations altitude of 220 miles may not be suitable for the telescope? seems to me that this would make for a great primary or backup science tool for the station. It seems to me that it could be easily adapted for station use.",

The James Webb telescope will be much much better, but it will not alow us to \"see\" earth-like planets....that will require a monstrous instrument I think the shuttle cannot land with a load that heavy. While there is no maximum TO weights involved (vertical lift vs. horizontal on wheels and struts) the same is not true upon landing. And any aircraft can take off horizontally at a much higher weight than it could possibly land with. Does this make sense?",
