I was stop lossed in 2003 and if anyone else who was stop lossed before oct. 2008 should write thier congressman and complain that this pay doesnt extend to ALL veterans who were involuntarily extended. Maybe if enough people complain we will all get back pay. Besides its a safer investment for the govt than AIG.",
