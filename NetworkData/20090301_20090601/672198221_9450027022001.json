        "content": ">http://zenhuber.blogspot.com Dumped from the mil.com opinion board, Jeff Huber continues to pen his salient, and usually well off-message bits, about the GWOT, and what it's doing to the rest of the world. To-day's piece is about the 'long' war, ie the one to-day's generation of American 12 year olds will be invited to join if the economy holds up and the Iranians don't nuke everybody. There may be a light visible in the tunnel but it just might be a miracle of holographics and stimulated radiation. Huber frames his argument much better than I. In the meantime, this is the pap we're given: Emma Sky: the voice that soothes the savage beast, or at least stays out of targetting anybody. >http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article6083011.ece",

No, a smart, savvy officer who starting in late 2006, along with Petraus, were FINALLY allowed to run the war the way they thought it should be run. Up until then, the war was being run by politicians who didn't even acknowledge that there was a war. Why not read \"Three Cups of Tea?\" Petreaus did. Dave",
