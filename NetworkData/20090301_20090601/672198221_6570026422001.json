Philidephia is a funny place. Interesting that Fox News finally has a story about voter intimidation to report. I wonder where they've been? quote: \"Voter terrorism\" For decades, Republicans have mounted highly organized operations to discourage minorities from voting. Experts say there's no reason to believe this year's presidential campaign will be any different. By Farhad Manjoo Sep 21, 2004 | Philadelphia's 2003 mayoral election did not set especially high standards for civic discourse in the city where American democracy was born. Talking to Philadelphians about the bitter contest between John Street, the African-American incumbent Democrat, and Sam Katz, the white Republican challenger, is like discussing an election in some upstart Latin American democracy. During the course of the race, Street's office was bugged by the FBI, a Katz field office was \"firebombed\" by an unlit Molotov cocktail, and on Election Day, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, 84 voting-related incidents were called in to police, including \"assaults, disturbances, threats, harassment, vandalism\" and one bona fide \"polling-place brawl.\" Amid the general ugliness of the race, though, there's one incident that Democrats in the city remember with a distinct sense of unease. The story, which was first reported by The American Prospect in February, and has since been broadcast by activist groups like MoveOn.org, goes like this: In an attempt to intimidate African-Americans and deter them from showing up at the polls, the Katz campaign, or one of its associates, put together a team of men dressed in official-looking attire -- dark suits, lapel pins bearing insignia of federal or local law-enforcement agencies -- and sent them into areas of the city with large black populations. According to Sherry Swirsky, a local antitrust attorney who is active in Democratic politics and who worked as an election monitor that day, the men carried clipboards and drove around in unmarked black vans. \"Some of them were just driving around neighborhoods, looking menacing,\" Swirsky recalls. \"But others were going up to voters and giving them misinformation about the kind of I.D. they needed in order to vote. The truth is, you don't need any I.D. to vote. But they were telling them they needed a major credit card, a passport or driver's license. They were telling them it was risky to vote if they had any outstanding child support bills. Imagine the menacing presence of a bunch of big white guys in black cars who look like they're law-enforcement people telling you all these things.\" \"http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/09/21/intimidation/index.html\" I guess organised mass campaigns are small stuff compared to two guys standing around doing nothing.

Philidephia is a funny place. Interesting that Fox News finally has a story about voter intimidation to report. I wonder where they've been? quote: \"Voter terrorism\" For decades, Republicans have mounted highly organized operations to discourage minorities from voting. Experts say there's no reason to believe this year's presidential campaign will be any different. By Farhad Manjoo Sep 21, 2004 | Philadelphia's 2003 mayoral election did not set especially high standards for civic discourse in the city where American democracy was born. Talking to Philadelphians about the bitter contest between John Street, the African-American incumbent Democrat, and Sam Katz, the white Republican challenger, is like discussing an election in some upstart Latin American democracy. During the course of the race, Street's office was bugged by the FBI, a Katz field office was \"firebombed\" by an unlit Molotov cocktail, and on Election Day, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, 84 voting-related incidents were called in to police, including \"assaults, disturbances, threats, harassment, vandalism\" and one bona fide \"polling-place brawl.\" Amid the general ugliness of the race, though, there's one incident that Democrats in the city remember with a distinct sense of unease. The story, which was first reported by The American Prospect in February, and has since been broadcast by activist groups like MoveOn.org, goes like this: In an attempt to intimidate African-Americans and deter them from showing up at the polls, the Katz campaign, or one of its associates, put together a team of men dressed in official-looking attire -- dark suits, lapel pins bearing insignia of federal or local law-enforcement agencies -- and sent them into areas of the city with large black populations. According to Sherry Swirsky, a local antitrust attorney who is active in Democratic politics and who worked as an election monitor that day, the men carried clipboards and drove around in unmarked black vans. \"Some of them were just driving around neighborhoods, looking menacing,\" Swirsky recalls. \"But others were going up to voters and giving them misinformation about the kind of I.D. they needed in order to vote. The truth is, you don't need any I.D. to vote. But they were telling them they needed a major credit card, a passport or driver's license. They were telling them it was risky to vote if they had any outstanding child support bills. Imagine the menacing presence of a bunch of big white guys in black cars who look like they're law-enforcement people telling you all these things.\" \"http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/09/21/intimidation/index.html\" I guess organised mass campaigns are small stuff compared to two guys standing around doing nothing.

You do NOT go to a district where your candidate is going to win.

To \"prove\" voter intimidation, you have to make a primi faci case that surpressing the vote in a Black Neighborhood is going to benefit the candidate that you choose. The \"eye witness\" afadavit that Fox cites, was of such a dubious nature, that it wasn't even included in the Bush legal case. Dave",
