Security forces guarded key government locations as supporters of fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra massed here, one day after activists raised tensions by attacking Abhisit's car and smashing a window. Police said around 60,000 red-clad protesters chanting \"Bring Thaksin back, Abhisit get out!\" gathered outside Abhisit's office in the capital, where demonstrators have been staging a sit-in for the past two weeks. A potential flashpoint arose when they later surrounded the house of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's top adviser, General Prem Tinsulanonda, who has been accused by Thaksin of orchestrating the coup that toppled him in 2006. \"We came here to expel the government,\" protest leader Nattawut Saikuar told the cheering crowd. He added that Prem should also quit for \"inciting the military to turn against democracy.\" Dozens of soldiers stood guard inside the adviser's house. The accusations against Prem have broken a major taboo in Thai society, where the royalty is revered, and fuelled the risk of what Abhisit described earlier this week as a \"civil war\" after more than three years of instability. British-born Abhisit warned the protesters of strong action if there was any violence, and rejected their demands to dissolve his four-month-old government and hold fresh elections. (...) The unrest has prompted mounting speculation that the army could try to mount another coup, despite the fact that Abhisit and his ministers are accused by their opponents of being the military's stooges. But powerful army chief General Anupong Paojinda ruled out talk of a putsch. \"No matter how the situation deteriorates, we will abide by the law and use no other extra power,\" he said. The so-called \"Red Shirts\" remain furious about the way Abhisit took power in December, after a court decision that removed billionaire Thaksin's allies from government. That ruling came after months of protests by rival, yellow-clad protesters claiming allegiance to the monarchy, who occupied Government House and mounted a crippling blockade of Bangkok's airports late last year. Thaksin, who is living in an undisclosed foreign country to avoid a prison term for corruption, promised that the protests would mark a \"historic day for Thailand.\" (...) The nation remains deeply divided between Thaksin's followers, mainly among the urban and rural poor in northern Thailand, and his foes in Bangkok's traditional power cliques of the palace, military and bureaucracy.

The move came just hours after thousands of pro-Thaksin demonstrators abandoned their three-week rally at Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's office, fearing a potentially bloody crackdown by government troops.

(...) The premier said a state of emergency imposed on Sunday in Bangkok and surrounding areas would remain in place while isolated \"incidents\" of protest were dealt with and promised to prosecute all protest leaders. But analysts warned that the violence had merely widened the rift between largely poor supporters of Thaksin and the government backed by the army and the Bangkok elite. (...) Shopping malls closed down by the violence quickly reopened, a boost for the struggling economy and the vital tourism industry after television images of the chaos in Bangkok flashed around the world.

Army spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said troops had also suppressed protests in three provinces on Monday, during which demonstrators took control of a television station and a railway terminal. Several countries have advised tourists not to travel to Thailand or to exercise caution if already there, while the US State Department condemned the \"unacceptable violence\" by the protesters. Bangkok emergency services said Tuesday that the toll from clashes between security forces, demonstrators and local residents stood at two dead and 123 wounded, 44 of whom were still in hospital.",

The move came just hours after thousands of pro-Thaksin demonstrators abandoned their three-week rally at Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's office, fearing a potentially bloody crackdown by government troops. A court issued warrants for Thaksin and 12 supporters, three of whom were detained by police and charged with crimes relating to the unrest, which saw soldiers and protesters fight running battles in Bangkok on Monday. (...) The premier said a state of emergency imposed on Sunday in Bangkok and surrounding areas would remain in place while isolated \"incidents\" of protest were dealt with and promised to prosecute all protest leaders. But analysts warned that the violence had merely widened the rift between largely poor supporters of Thaksin and the government backed by the army and the Bangkok elite. (...) Shopping malls closed down by the violence quickly reopened, a boost for the struggling economy and the vital tourism industry after television images of the chaos in Bangkok flashed around the world. (...) Army spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said troops had also suppressed protests in three provinces on Monday, during which demonstrators took control of a television station and a railway terminal. Several countries have advised tourists not to travel to Thailand or to exercise caution if already there, while the US State Department condemned the \"unacceptable violence\" by the protesters. Bangkok emergency services said Tuesday that the toll from clashes between security forces, demonstrators and local residents stood at two dead and 123 wounded, 44 of whom were still in hospital.",
