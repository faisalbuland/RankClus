There's this talk of spreading the wealth around and the mysterious tax code of the future. I see only new taxes that are going to drive investment out of this country. Large employers are moving manufacturing and engineering resources overseas not because they can see tangible success but that they can see lower labor costs that aren't likely to last as the dollar shrinks. Here's where I'm going with this. If the President and his Congress want to raise taxes why don't they consider those who don't pay taxes at all and those who aren't U.S. Citizens? If lawmakers look at all forms of discretionary household spending they could consider that which applies to products that are made offshore. They could look at spending that will result in declining health and how it will burden the healthcare system that may offer us less and less in the future. Those with smoking and alcohol habits should pay more over the counter. Unhealthy food in restaurants where people go for a quick fix should also be considered. The President and those in congress who may really care about jobs could consider how they tax the wealthy. Rather than the $250,000 threshold for increased taxes they could consider tax write-offs for those who invest in companies with 250 or fewer employees. There are lots of smart people getting laid off. These people want often want to start a business. Our Military is able to defend our freedom because there are revenues to support our defense. A worthless dollar will result in a worthless U.S.A. What I see from our government now is those who are grasping at straws for how to keep our economy on life support. Some of our Congress folks know this stuff but they aren't being hammered by the public for better solutions. If I'm wrong please explain to me.",

Those people stand to get well over the $400 to $800 they're entitled to. Come tax time, they will have to give back the additional amount. The government says for most people that will just mean a smaller refund next year, but tax advisors say some people might want to have more taken out now. *The Associated Press contributed to this report.* Simple solutions from simple minded people don't work that well. BTW, if you owe a penalty for underpayment of taxes don't forget to ask for a waver of penalty like Rep. Rangel and Sec. Treas. Geithner received.",
