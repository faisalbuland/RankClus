To jog some memory possibly i was discharged on a fraud entry due to a recruiter and meps lission telling me not to worry about it. even though i disclosed it at MEPS and to the recruiter people still thought i lied, but oh well. i applied for an upgrade and change in characterization and code. it was not granted due to lack of paperwork. oh well it happens. last month i decided to enlist again. the waiver was approved now waiting on a physical and retake the ASVAB. looking forward to serving yet again.",
