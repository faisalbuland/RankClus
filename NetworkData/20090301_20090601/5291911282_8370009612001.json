        "content": "I was recently medically disqualified from AFROTC for 2 reasons, both of which don't hinder me physically in any way. In March of 2005 I had spinal fusion of more than 2 vertebrae which is disqualifying. However, I have updated my medical records since they were sent in to DoDMERB and gotten a written letter from my orthopedic surgeon that I am cleared for any and all physical activity. I have no pain whatsoever and have healed extremely well. My spine is exactly the same as someone's without titanium rods. I ran varsity track hurdles in high school and have played competitive basketball for years. My PFA score while I was in ROTC last semester was outstanding. I maxed push-ups, sit ups, and was 8 seconds from maxing the 1.5 mi. The other disqualifying issue was celiac disease- a gluten/wheat intolerance. The thing is, I have never had a blood test to verify that I actually am celiac. I spoke too soon when giving DoDMERB medical information. It never occurred to me that the issue would be disqualifying. I identified with some of the symptoms of a celiac and found that not eating wheat stopped those symptoms. After trial and error with certain diets, my physician and I have recently determined I am only gluten sensitive. The reactions I get after eating bread or wheat are actually quite minimal- gas and bloating. There is no pain or anything that would hold me back in the field. My doctor is in the process of writing a letter clearing me of the wrongful diagnosis. I have heard from several military members and recruiters that there are waivers for everything. I've spoken with with a Marine recruiter who has seen someone with spinal fusion similar to mine get a waiver so I know it's possible! Has anyone out there experienced the waivering process like this? -Cherileigh, FL",

If you have back problems already, I doubt anyone will sign you up BECAUSE of the weight you are required to carry around. If by some chance they do let you in - and you aggrivate your injuries - you will get nothing and they will medically kick you out. Do not take further injury lightly. As you know - back pain is nothing to mess with!!! Plus, if you are in bad shape - then your buddies will have to pick up your slack (which is no fun).",
