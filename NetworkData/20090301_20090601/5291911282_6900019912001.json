I feel that there are bigger and better opportunities out there for me as well as my FAMILY. I've been thinking about enlisting into the Airforce Reserves for a while now because i've heard about alot of benefits that I think would benefit ME. As great as that may sound, I am more interested in how my 3 boys and my wife can benefit from this. Basically my main question is: By me enlisting, does uncle Sam help me pay for my boys education and possibly my wifes education? I have an 11 year old going on 12 in July, a 3 year old going on 4 in August, and a four month old. My wife is 31 and their future is my concern. I am willing to do and sacrifice anything for them!",

If your still here, follow this: I was 10 years into a Teaching and Coaching career, making about $15,000.00 a year working from daylight to dark (6 classes a day, the football, wrestling, tennis,and track after school), and the community swimming pool (0700-2100 Mon-Sat).

I was never seeing my wife and 4 sons anyway, except when they came to events or the pool , so I decided to give up the extra-curricular involvement and go for it. After the third year, I was bringing in as much as $20,000.00 extra a year, by doing night duty and extended TDY deployments in the summer (This was in the 80s before Desert Storm). In other words, I often better than doubled my civilian income. I got back in Uniform (I'd been in the Army), where I really felt at home, and I did some things (especially on Drug Interdiction missions \"points south\") that I felt really made a GOOD difference. Because I remained a High School teacher, I promoted Patriotism there, often taking part in Patriotic Veterans Day Assemblies and such. I often inspired students to enter all branches of the Services. Two are attending West Point helped by my letters of recommendation.

Couple of thoughts after reading your post and the replies that you got. A) Scroll down to the Air Force section and then look for the Guard & Reserve sub-section. Post your questions there. Ask the local Recruiter some questions and read the brochures. B) Talk with your wife. You already have a steady civilian job as a Postal Worker. If you sign-up for the AF Reserve you will have to attend Basic Training which is now about 7-8 weeks at Lackland AFB in Texas. Can she handle the housework/pay the bills/buy-shop for groceries/get the older boy to school and take care of the smaller boys/take them to the doctor-dentist/add a quart of oil to the car...? For 2 months ? By herself ? Then after you graduate Basic Training at Lackland, you are sent to whatever Tech (job) school that your Reseerve Unit has a vacancy for... Tech school can be a month to 6 months long, depending on the difficulty level of the course/task. Is she going to be able to handle \"things\" and situations while you are away ? Talk to her and ask HER what she thinks. Many women want their husbands at home with them and the kids. Save yourself a ton of grief and heartache. Get the Recruiter to sit down and answer her questions, if you proceed. After Tech School, then you return to your Home of record and the next Drill Weekend you get over to the AF Reserve Base/Center and report in. Usually about 0700 hrs Saturday until about 1630 hrs. Sunday. Once a month. That means you may miss birthday parties of relatives/weddings/Little League games,Cub Scout stuff, Sunday Church service etc... 2 weeks a year you and the Unit do annual Training. Could be at the nearest Air Base to your Home, or you could be sent overseas for training. Then there is something that you and your wife REALLY need to talk about: It is called Activation... nope not the Cell phone kind, I'm talking about your unit gets a notice that says you are Activated and will be going overseas for a tour... usually at least 6 months. Can your wife handle you being gone for 6 months ? You need to do some thinking and talking, before you become a statistic of the Divorce desease. If it sounds like I'm trying to talk you out of joining--- you are correct. Why ? Because your Thread Title and you question are ALL WRONG! The \"benefits\" are NOT why anyone should sign-up. They are just that \"benefits\". The reason for joining any branch of the Armed Forces should NOT be job training or worse \"college\" money... or \"benefits\". The Reason for joining is to protect and defend The Constitution of the United States of America from all enemies Foriegn and Domestic! If you are not of that mindset, then stay at the Post Office and be a dad to your kids, and a husband to your wife.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by familyfirst: Hello everybody. My name is Mark and i'm 33 years old in June. I work for the U.S Post Office and have been there for 10 years going on 11. I feel that there are bigger and better opportunities out there for me as well as my FAMILY. I've been thinking about enlisting into the Airforce Reserves for a while now because i've heard about alot of benefits that I think would benefit ME. As great as that may sound, I am more interested in how my 3 boys and my wife can benefit from this. Basically my main question is: By me enlisting, does uncle Sam help me pay for my boys education and possibly my wifes education? I have an 11 year old going on 12 in July, a 3 year old going on 4 in August, and a four month old. My wife is 31 and their future is my concern. I am willing to do and sacrifice anything for them!", 
        "reply": " Couple of thoughts after reading your post and the replies that you got. A) Scroll down to the Air Force section and then look for the Guard & Reserve sub-section. Post your questions there. Ask the local Recruiter some questions and read the brochures. B) Talk with your wife. You already have a steady civilian job as a Postal Worker. If you sign-up for the AF Reserve you will have to attend Basic Training which is now about 7-8 weeks at Lackland AFB in Texas. Can she handle the housework/pay the bills/buy-shop for groceries/get the older boy to school and take care of the smaller boys/take them to the doctor-dentist/add a quart of oil to the car...? For 2 months ? By herself ? Then after you graduate Basic Training at Lackland, you are sent to whatever Tech (job) school that your Reseerve Unit has a vacancy for... Tech school can be a month to 6 months long, depending on the difficulty level of the course/task. Is she going to be able to handle \"things\" and situations while you are away ? Talk to her and ask HER what she thinks. Many women want their husbands at home with them and the kids. Save yourself a ton of grief and heartache. Get the Recruiter to sit down and answer her questions, if you proceed. After Tech School, then you return to your Home of record and the next Drill Weekend you get over to the AF Reserve Base/Center and report in. Usually about 0700 hrs Saturday until about 1630 hrs. Sunday. Once a month. That means you may miss birthday parties of relatives/weddings/Little League games,Cub Scout stuff, Sunday Church service etc... 2 weeks a year you and the Unit do annual Training. Could be at the nearest Air Base to your Home, or you could be sent overseas for training. Then there is something that you and your wife REALLY need to talk about: It is called Activation... nope not the Cell phone kind, I'm talking about your unit gets a notice that says you are Activated and will be going overseas for a tour... usually at least 6 months. Can your wife handle you being gone for 6 months ? You need to do some thinking and talking, before you become a statistic of the Divorce desease. If it sounds like I'm trying to talk you out of joining--- you are correct. Why ? Because your Thread Title and you question are ALL WRONG! The \"benefits\" are NOT why anyone should sign-up. They are just that \"benefits\". The reason for joining any branch of the Armed Forces should NOT be job training or worse \"college\" money... or \"benefits\". The Reason for joining is to protect and defend The Constitution of the United States of America from all enemies Foriegn and Domestic! If you are not of that mindset, then stay at the Post Office and be a dad to your kids, and a husband to your wife.",
