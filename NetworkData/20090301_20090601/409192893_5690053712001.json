The letter is entitled, \u2018Dear IRS\u2019 and starts out by explaining that he won\u2019t be able to pay his taxes this year and asks the IRS to treat him like famous tax cheats, like Charles Rangel, Barney Frank, Senator Chris Dodd, Tom Daschle and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. The letter was printed in the Wichita Falls, Texas Times Record News in February 2009. The letter started gaining attention and has recently gone viral with other newspapers and the internet spreading Barnett\u2019s words to everyone. In the letter, Barnett lists 37 other taxes he\u2019s paid and promises to pay a little bit as soon as he gets his stimulus check. Mr. Barnett is a bit surprised at the attention his letter has gotten. The thing is, Dear Mr. Barnett, we can all relate. Here\u2019s the text of Ed Barnett\u2019s letter text: Dear IRS, I\u2019m sorry to inform you that I\u2019m not going to be able to pay the taxes owed on April 15th, but all is not lost. I paid these taxes: accounts receivable tax, building permit tax, CDL tax, corporate income tax, dog license tax, federal income tax, unemployment tax, gas tax, hunting license tax, fishing license tax, waterfowl stamp tax, inheritance tax, inventory tax, liquor tax, luxury tax, Medicare tax, city tax, school and county property tax up to 33% the last four years. Real estate tax, Social Security tax, road use tax, toll road tax, state and city sales tax, recreational vehicle tax, sales franchise tax, state unemployment tax, federal excise tax, telephone tax, telephone federal state and local surcharge tax, telephone minimum usage surcharge tax, telephone state and local tax, utility tax, vehicle tax, registration tax, capital gains tax, lease severance tax, oil and gas assessment tax, Colorado property tax, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Mexico sales tax and many more I can\u2019t recall and I\u2019ve run out of space and money. When you do not receive my check April 15th, just know that it was an honest mistake. Please treat me the same as the way you\u2019ve treated Congressmen Charlie Rangel, Chris Dodd, Barney Frank, ex-congressman Tom Daschle and, of course, your boss, Timothy Geithner. No penalties, no interest. PS, I\u2019ll make at least a partial payment as soon as I get my stimulus check. Ed Barnett, Wichita Falls.",
