        "content": "RACINE COUNTY \u2014 An important new gun-carry ruling has even gun rights advocates seeing imperfection in this state\u2019s gun-carry laws. Tuesday gun rights advocates and top law enforcement officials here were asked to weigh in on Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen\u2019s Monday memo. It stated that openly wearing a holstered gun is not grounds for a disorderly conduct charge. The case involved a West Allis man who was charged with disorderly conduct for openly carrying a gun on his property while planting a tree. The result of Van Hollen\u2019s opinion is that one cannot legally carry a concealed weapon in this state \u2014 but bearing one in plain sight is within the law. That doesn\u2019t mean all gun rights supporters are happy with the situation. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the open carry,\u201d said Jim Schunk, owner of Shooters Sports Center, 4900 6 Mile Road. \u201cI believe you should have to go through a class and get a certification to be able to carry,\u201d said Schunk, a former police officer. But Schunk said he thought Van Hollen\u2019s ruling was sensible under current law. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to push our political system to take a second look at this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to regulate this somehow.\u201d State Rep. Scott Gunderson, R-Waterford, pointed out that state law forbids concealing a weapon \u2014 but says nothing about carrying one openly. \u201cIt\u2019s not addressed, so it can\u2019t be illegal,\u201d he said. He said concealed-carry law opponents may have induced the current state of affairs. Gunderson twice worked to pass a concealed-carry bill through the Legislature, but both times Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed it. \u201cIt just seems to me if we would have passed concealed carry law, I have a hard time believing we would be at this point today,\u201d Gunderson said. \u201cPeople are going to have to be a little careful what they wish for.\u201d The sight of a firearm on someone else\u2019s hip may be nerve-wracking for some people, and state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Caledonia commented, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why Wisconsin should allow concealed carry, like 48 other states.\u201d Besides this state, only Illinois forbids carrying a concealed gun. Vos called Van Hollen\u2019s opinion well-researched and well-thought out. Racine County Sheriff Bob Carlson said from now on, if a caller reports someone with a gun, dispatchers will be instructed to ask other questions such as: Is the person agitated, quarreling, or in a place posted against guns? And so on. \u201cI want to avoid any kind of visceral leap toward making an arrest purely on the basis of carrying a firearm,\u201d Carlson said. But he noted that the ruling pertains only to a holstered gun \u2014 not one in the hand. Similarly, it\u2019s still illegal to have a gun lying on a car seat, for example. And pointing a gun at someone is \u201cabsolutely\u201d illegal, Carlson pointed out. Racine Police Department spokesman Sgt. Bernie Kupper said the ruling will not prevent police from stopping and questioning a person with a firearm. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not accompanied by erratic behavior, they answer the questions truthfully, etc., they may be allowed to go on their way,\u201d Kupper said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a get-out-of-jail-free card,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can still make investigative stops.\u201d \"http://www.journaltimes.com/articles/2009/04/21/local_news/doc49ee4a286c67b468031272.txt\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
