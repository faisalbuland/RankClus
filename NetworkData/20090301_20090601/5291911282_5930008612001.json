He got out after three years and enrolled in seminary. The air force reserve accepted him so he could be a Chaplin for them and the CAP during his seminary days.

When he returned the chief of chaplains for the navy realized as he stated it \"A once in a life time opportunity and ask him how he would feel about having another uniform in his sea bag.\" he accepted, of course, and was detailed to the Coast Guard. About ten years ago, he retired as a navy-captain chaplain at Paris Island with 30 years active duty. There was a big story about him in the military time, all of them.
