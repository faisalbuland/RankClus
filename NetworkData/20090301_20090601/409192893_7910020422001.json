The part that really bugs me is that if the parent doesn't fill in the form, the district will. How will they know????? Our campus should receive the rating exemplary.

How could someone else know? How would they prove it? How many generations back? We also have to get fingerprinted this summer. How did your TAKS go? I think all teachers in Texas got one...I have always had an issue with questions like that...I figure that as long as race is used as a measure, then there will be racism. In the past on job applications when the race question was there I would check \"other\" or fill in, \"human.\" One time when I was in college I put in NHRA... The form went home in March and a lot of parents pitched a fit...as did several teachers. I just ignored it until I got called down to explain why I had not turned it in...then I got called back to fill it in after I turned it in without answering the questions. All the teachers in our district have to pass a background check and be fingerprinted. That has been going on here for years. No biggie...I did that a couple of years back...anyway, other than the TEA, my fingerprints are in the DoD database and no where else. The TAKS went very well this year. Our scores were very good and we will be Recognized. I had 13 of 17 resource students pass the first time around and the second administration was just last Tuesday so the scores are not in. I expect that two of the four who failed will pass this time. Our Science and Reading/Writing scores were very high this time. How did it go for you?", 
        "reply": " Yes, I tried to turn in a blank one too! Then the secretary brought it to me and waited while I filled it out. However, we just got our forms the other day. The part that really bugs me is that if the parent doesn't fill in the form, the district will. How will they know????? Our campus should receive the rating exemplary. Thank heaven, I don't have a TAKS class now; however, we just get them ready in 6th grade to go on to the next grade and pass the 8th grade science TAKS. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",

Our scores were very good and we will be Recognized. I had 13 of 17 resource students pass the first time around and the second administration was just last Tuesday so the scores are not in. I expect that two of the four who failed will pass this time. Our Science and Reading/Writing scores were very high this time. How did it go for you?", 
        "reply": " Yes, I tried to turn in a blank one too! Then the secretary brought it to me and waited while I filled it out. However, we just got our forms the other day. The part that really bugs me is that if the parent doesn't fill in the form, the district will. How will they know????? Our campus should receive the rating exemplary. Thank heaven, I don't have a TAKS class now; however, we just get them ready in 6th grade to go on to the next grade and pass the 8th grade science TAKS. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",
