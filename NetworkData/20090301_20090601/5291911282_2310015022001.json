We get there and are in our vehicles covering the roads for about a half hour. I am sending messages back and forth with my bro who is the TC of the vehicle to my rear. He said he had to poo. I told him he is screwed because we will be here for another few hours, and he cant get out of the truck because of the mines. He said he was going to look around in the back for an ammo can. I thought he was joking. I told him his truck crew was going to hate him for life... 10 minutes later I saw both front doors open and his gunner pop up and start dry heaving over the side of the turret. He wasn't joking... His driver grabbed his camera and turned around in his seat and yelled bro's name loud... Bro turned his head quickly Camera went \"CLICK\" A legend was born.",
