That is a stretch when considering it being the home of politic's which is nothing but hot air. plus the fact I've spent vacations in D C and the pollution is the far worse than any city I've been in including LA, New York, London, New Orleans, St Louis, Miami etc. Prudhoe would be a paradise compared to D C. No drilling in ANWR but 60 miles away Prudhoe is OK and a little further is the western wilderness of Canada that produces most of the oil we use. Go figure.

It was just a snowjob (excuse the pun) by the Libs to halt all drilling of fossil fuels. It was proven a long time ago that the drilling in ANWR would have zero impact on any wildlife in the area. Of course, Obama is in trouble again with his supporters for going back on yet another campaign promise. bad you must not be old enough to have seen some of the GARBAGE and WASTELANDS that COMPANIES turned alot of the envoronment in to after they got through with it. Try 70s and back. You say look at 70s and back. This is 2009 now, welcome home. We have come along way with technology and safety. I agree with BAD that harming the wildlife is not a reason anymore. If it were, we wouldn't have Nuclear plants anymore because we would be scared that they are leaking into the ground and they could blow at any moment. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

No drilling in ANWR but 60 miles away Prudhoe is OK and a little further is the western wilderness of Canada that produces most of the oil we use. Go figure.
