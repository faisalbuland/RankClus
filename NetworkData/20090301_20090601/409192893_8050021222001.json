These things always come full circle. Dems and Repubs can't help it...they are programmed to take their majority and try to push the country further left or right than it really wants to go. So we have the pendulum effect...the farther we go back and forth the more chaotic it will become. My issue is that when the country \u201cswings right\u201d I feel it is getting back to the basics. Today on swinging left\u2026we are NOT getting back to the basics. I do not call John McCain a \u201cswinging right movement\u201d however.

Pretty much spot-on until the late 70's and 80's, when the Democrats went from \"social justice\" to \"socialism\" and the GOP had to take up the torch of religeous freedom, family values and small government. It's kind of ironic...the Democratic party is founded by a slave-owning super-wealthy state's rights champion, and the GOP has it's roots with the \"all powerful central government\" crowd, and in a mere 200 years they pretty much completely switched. FYI, if group can be called the \"rich white man's club\", I think the Democratic party from it's founding until the present day DEFINITLY qualifies. So, in my book, have no fear...in 200 years, the Dems will once again be led by slave-owning super-rich white men, and the GOP will be the \"I don't care who you are as long as you want absolute power consolidated in Washington\" club.",
