Its a persuasive essay on some issue of race(she seems to be obsessed with race and gender issues ) The sad thing is that if one of my white counterparts turned this in he might be branded a racist, i'll surely be a sell-out. Working Thesis: The issue of illegal immigration has become a divisive and detrimental subject due in part to native-born Hispanics who support this activity. Hispanics have contributed greatly to America in every facet of our civilization, but they undermine these contributions and their own image by choosing cultural pride over the rule of law. Moral support for individuals who violate our laws creates a confusing image of native-born Hispanics, even though this support might act as a catalyst for change in the conditions that lead to illegal immigration. 1. Moral support for individuals who violate our laws. The United States of America is a nation of laws. As children we are not allowed to toss rocks into windows or water balloons at moving cars, even though this behavior might be seen as, \u201c boys being boys,\u201d it is wrong and dangerous and as children we are taught these simple values. As we progress into our teenage years we are not allowed to drive without the proper permits and or license, we are not allowed to smoke or drink until a certain age is reached, and we are not allowed to do countless other activities that harm ourselves or others. Clearly, anyone who is a part of American society understands that whether we like certain laws or not, it is not up to us to choose which ones we will follow, and we certainly do not support those who believe in such ideology. I have yet to see any serious organized effort to support teenage drunk driving, or reckless children who toss rocks from freeway overpasses, so why do some Hispanics support the people who commit the crime of entering the United States illegally.? 2. Confusing image of native-born Hispanics emerges The strongest answer I can provide is the link previous illegal immigrants share with their native-born sons and daughters. It is incredibly hard to view ones relatives as criminals when they do not engage in obvious acts of crime like robbery or drug trafficking, but it is certainly an inconvenient truth that must be acknowledged. Whether our parents were immigrated legally or not, it should not influence our resolve to abide by the rule of law, yet this is exactly what has been going on for several years. The sight of tens of thousands of protesters in Los Angeles, California marching with Mexican flags is not a sign that the best interests of the United States are being considered. It is a sign of laws taking a back seat to cultural pride. As a nation we have fought countless battles for equality among majority groups and minorities, but this is a fight that cannot be won if we continue to create divisions by choosing to ignore the values and traditions of America. This behavior automatically creates a volatile atmosphere where all Hispanics are viewed as supporters of illegal immigration when the reality couldn\u2019t be further from the rhetoric. If we want to be fully accepted as just another American, we have to do what is right, not for our sense of pride, but for our nation. 3. Moral support for illegal immigrants can be the catalyst for solutions to their problem. Many people will argue that we cannot simply ignore the plight of impoverished people in Mexico or the countless other nations who have citizens that dream of the American way of life. Indifference is not something that I advocate, but words do nothing to solve ingrained problems in these impoverished nations. The lack of education and economic opportunities is a grave and serious problem for many illegal immigrants, but we cannot jeopardize our own society to alleviate these issues. It takes a tremendous amount of financial resources to make meaningful impacts in the lives of these people, but these are sacrifices that we cannot continue to make when our own economic infrastructure is in turmoil, nor can we do so in the future when it is stabilized. I am a firm believer in individual responsibility, individual resolve, and individual determination, but these are ideals that cannot be provided by government assistance or moral support. In fact, these are ideals that are the back bone of the American way of life so why are we denying them the opportunity to embrace them by \u201cbailing\u201d them out if you will. In the end, the only people who are hurt are Hispanics of all walks of life, and no one else by continuing to support illegal immigration. 4. Conclusion. The rule of law is a necessary and absolutely critical part of any rational and organized nation. This ensures our prosperity and unity in good times and bad. We cannot jeopardize this due to cultural pride or emotional attachments. We cannot fuel the voices of hate by sending mixed signals and confusing messages that in one breath enjoy everything America has to offer, and with the other ignore the values and traditions of our nation.",
