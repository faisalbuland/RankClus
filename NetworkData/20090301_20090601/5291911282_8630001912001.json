We set Japan on the right track...it has productive and bright people who were misguided by an upper echelon of deranged kooks who had the whole population headed the wrong way. Look at the atrocities that Japan inflicted on Mongolia, Korea, the Philippines and even China over history's unfolding drama. Drastic action was NEEDED...and it was TAKEN. Warnings were issued by the US, and they were ignored and went UNHEEDED. After the first bomb was dropped, Japan STILL wanted to foolishly continue to \"mix it up\". The 2nd bomb finally woke them up as to the error of their hostile, expansionist ideas, and the war came to an end. Many lives were lost on both sides, but many more were saved in the long run, by halting the war, which would likely have continued another 4 to 5 years or more. One can't sit here in 2009, and try to play the 'blame game' with minds that were faced with the realities of the 1940s and an expensive, expansive, ongoing war. The ships in Pearl Harbor did NOT explode/sink themselves! Those kamikaze airplanes that flew into US ship after US ship, killing Americans, were not pilotless drones...Iwo Jima wasn't some peaceful little idyllic rocky island...it was crawling with A/A gun nests and caves, and entrenched Japanese forces. The battles of Midway, Tarawa, Peleliu, Palau, Wake...have we already forgotten how far the \"rising sun\" had spread? This was serious business. Today we have liberal schmucks who try to demonize this country, and their ideologies couldn't be more destructive or wrong-headed. Get over it and move on! They've tried to rewrite history, and they are cheating our children out of the truth with their liberal 'indoctrination' and gross, politically-correct, but dishonest misinformation campaigns. I WON'T and DON'T APOLOGIZE to ANYONE or ANYTHING for being AMERICAN. These liberal leftist socialists are amoral 'change agents' whose loyalties are NOT to America and her PEOPLE. What are YOUR children being taught? Do you REALLY know?",

        "reply": "The idiot \"emporor\" of Japan had it in his head that his ever-spreading program was 'unstoppable'. We set Japan on the right track...it has productive and bright people who were misguided by an upper echelon of deranged kooks who had the whole population headed the wrong way. Look at the atrocities that Japan inflicted on Mongolia, Korea, the Philippines and even China over history's unfolding drama. Drastic action was NEEDED...and it was TAKEN. Warnings were issued by the US, and they were ignored and went UNHEEDED. After the first bomb was dropped, Japan STILL wanted to foolishly continue to \"mix it up\". The 2nd bomb finally woke them up as to the error of their hostile, expansionist ideas, and the war came to an end. Many lives were lost on both sides, but many more were saved in the long run, by halting the war, which would likely have continued another 4 to 5 years or more. One can't sit here in 2009, and try to play the 'blame game' with minds that were faced with the realities of the 1940s and an expensive, expansive, ongoing war. The ships in Pearl Harbor did NOT explode/sink themselves! Those kamikaze airplanes that flew into US ship after US ship, killing Americans, were not pilotless drones...Iwo Jima wasn't some peaceful little idyllic rocky island...it was crawling with A/A gun nests and caves, and entrenched Japanese forces. The battles of Midway, Tarawa, Peleliu, Palau, Wake...have we already forgotten how far the \"rising sun\" had spread? This was serious business.

Dropping the bombs shortened the war and saved American lives. If it saved Japanese lives, that's beyond the point. They had earned NO mercy... explain to me again why the only alternatives for the US were 1) massive land invasion of Japan 2) atomic weapons because I don't really understand why something like a blockade wasn't an option You do know that the USN was taking such a pounding from kamikazes that they were getting short of escort vesels, right? And that the Japanese had thousands of acft and volunteers to fly them to continue the onslaught, right? You do know that the objective throughout the war was unconditional surrender, right? You do know that leaving the military structure in place may have had consequenes later on, right? Bottom line, they were used and the war ended, so yes to original question.

Haven't you been watching any of the History Channel in the last 20 years? The Japanese were not that far from developing super weapons themselves. They had pontoon aircraft carried on submarines that could have delivered weapons to America. They had dropped bombs loaded with anthrax on cities all over China - - America had to defeat Japan ASAP to keep the Russians from claiming half of the island and the Pacific themselves - - DUH! WHAT planet did you come from?? Wandering and Wondering",

Dad and these uncles were also EXTREMELY HAPPY that they did not have to invade Japan, because certainly some of them, along with an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 American soldiers would have died taking Japan, along with maybe 5-10,000,000 Japanese! Dropping the bombs shortened the war and saved American lives. If it saved Japanese lives, that's beyond the point. They had earned NO mercy... explain to me again why the only alternatives for the US were 1) massive land invasion of Japan 2) atomic weapons because I don't really understand why something like a blockade wasn't an option You do know that the USN was taking such a pounding from kamikazes that they were getting short of escort vesels, right? And that the Japanese had thousands of acft and volunteers to fly them to continue the onslaught, right? You do know that the objective throughout the war was unconditional surrender, right? You do know that leaving the military structure in place may have had consequenes later on, right? Bottom line, they were used and the war ended, so yes to original question.
