Along this time my stress level has increased dramatically. i have a gf that will most likely leave me in my time at basic, and my mother is not doing too good with bills. i have to go cash some of my bonds today so we can pay rent, i have come to realize that the army life is not for me! i have told my readiness NCO, but to no avail i received no help on my status. i told my recruiter i would like to be discharged, he is supposed to talk to me today..but the last time we did this he just gave me a speech about how this will be a choice that makes or breaks me. i already have decided i am not going to do this..hopefully i can get help cuz the last thing i want is a Dishonorable Discharge! if you have any ideas of wat i can do please post them... and i understand if you want to break my balls for failing to live up to my commitment but i love the army its just not something that a 17 yr old kid really should have to deal with right now..if i can get a discharge where i can join again in the future i gladly will but this is too much stress for me right now...Hopefully somone can help me cuz everyone else i go to ignores wat i have to say!

Most high school grads are not qualified to be anything more than a burger-flipper. If he wishes to help mom and to push forward into life, with a chance to succeed, he needs to STOP doing things just because his love interest doesn't agree with his career choices.

        "content": "tbthomas, It's too early for you to decide this isn't for you. Listen to those who have BTDT. At your age, and with your education, you aren't likely to find a legal job that pays better than the Army. You are just letting too many things pile up on you that aren't worth losing any sleep over. Here are some tips: 1. Lose the dingbat. If she won't stay steady with you while you go to basic, you sure as h---don't want to marry her. Why shackle yourself to someone with no staying power? So you don't go in the military, but you fall on hard times in the civilian world. Do you think this piece of fluff will stand by your side and meet any challenges? She'll be one of those who sits on her butt in front of the TV all day long and whines because she can't buy a new pair of shoes! 2. Basic is no easy deal, but it's only about 8 weeks long, right? And during that 8 weeks, you don't have to make any decisions. You'll be told where to be and when, what to wear and what to do. As long as you meet those basic requirements, you won't have a problem. Work on making sure you can handle the physical requirements before you start training and while you're cruising along, you'll be seeing all the others who didn't prepare, crying for their mothers. The best advice my dad gave me was \"always watch for the humor\". A lot of really funny stuff happens in basic. You can laugh your way all the way through. 3. Once you're done with basic, the Army will train you to do a job. But you know what? You will still have 2-3 years of simply doing what your told, when your told, in the uniform prescribed. Imagine that! Getting paid and not having to make any decisions while doing it! My son went off to the first gulf war, as an E-3 right out of advanced training. He called me to say he was just a bit scared at the prospect. I told him, you just do your job to the best of your ability and NCOs and officers will take care of you. He was assigned as a medic to a Hawk missile battery and he loved it. He is now making very good money in California as a Nurse in the civilian sector. He got almost all his medical training through the military. Along the way, he dumped his first wife (who had a lot in common with your girlfriend), and will soon marry a very sharp young woman who is a Captain in the regular AF. 3. Getting a steady job with the Army is the best way you can help your mom. As Elesso said, you'll have a steady income and very few personal expenses. Military housing for even lower ranking personnel is getting better every day. You'll have a nice place to live, the Army will feed you and take care of a lot of your clothing needs related to the job, and take care of your medical needs. In time, if you are supporting your mother, you may even be able to claim her as a dependent, making her eligible for medical care and other bennies. So, going into the Army may be the best decision you could make right now. It won't always be easy, but I've had a lot of jobs in my 60 years, and my military jobs were usually the best paying and the most rewarding. I am financially secure in these troubled times because I made the most of the opportunities the military gave me. Dump the whining dingbat. Ask Mom to hang on a bit longer. Go into the military...give it your all and do the best job you can. Then come back here a year from now and tell us if your life hasn't improved dramatically.",

It's not about the money kid, it's about Honor, Duty, Respect (for yourself and others) and standing up to fight for those that can't/won't. You obviously can't grasp that...",

Any girl worth her skirt will stand by you no matter what. I stood by my husband through basic training, and am still standing by him despite the fact that he's a disabled veteran. If you want to let a girl ruin your life because you don't want to be away from her, then by all means, go for it, it's your life. \"and the money you get from the army is not worth the energy put in\"-- Okay, that right there tells me that the Army is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU. It's not about the money kid, it's about Honor, Duty, Respect (for yourself and others) and standing up to fight for those that can't/won't. You obviously can't grasp that...",

        "content": "tbthomas, It's too early for you to decide this isn't for you. Listen to those who have BTDT. At your age, and with your education, you aren't likely to find a legal job that pays better than the Army. You are just letting too many things pile up on you that aren't worth losing any sleep over. Here are some tips: 1. Lose the dingbat. If she won't stay steady with you while you go to basic, you sure as h---don't want to marry her. Why shackle yourself to someone with no staying power? So you don't go in the military, but you fall on hard times in the civilian world. Do you think this piece of fluff will stand by your side and meet any challenges? She'll be one of those who sits on her butt in front of the TV all day long and whines because she can't buy a new pair of shoes! 2. Basic is no easy deal, but it's only about 8 weeks long, right? And during that 8 weeks, you don't have to make any decisions. You'll be told where to be and when, what to wear and what to do. As long as you meet those basic requirements, you won't have a problem. Work on making sure you can handle the physical requirements before you start training and while you're cruising along, you'll be seeing all the others who didn't prepare, crying for their mothers. The best advice my dad gave me was \"always watch for the humor\". A lot of really funny stuff happens in basic. You can laugh your way all the way through. 3. Once you're done with basic, the Army will train you to do a job. But you know what? You will still have 2-3 years of simply doing what your told, when your told, in the uniform prescribed. Imagine that! Getting paid and not having to make any decisions while doing it! My son went off to the first gulf war, as an E-3 right out of advanced training. He called me to say he was just a bit scared at the prospect. I told him, you just do your job to the best of your ability and NCOs and officers will take care of you. He was assigned as a medic to a Hawk missile battery and he loved it. He is now making very good money in California as a Nurse in the civilian sector. He got almost all his medical training through the military. Along the way, he dumped his first wife (who had a lot in common with your girlfriend), and will soon marry a very sharp young woman who is a Captain in the regular AF. 3. Getting a steady job with the Army is the best way you can help your mom. As Elesso said, you'll have a steady income and very few personal expenses. Military housing for even lower ranking personnel is getting better every day. You'll have a nice place to live, the Army will feed you and take care of a lot of your clothing needs related to the job, and take care of your medical needs. In time, if you are supporting your mother, you may even be able to claim her as a dependent, making her eligible for medical care and other bennies. So, going into the Army may be the best decision you could make right now. It won't always be easy, but I've had a lot of jobs in my 60 years, and my military jobs were usually the best paying and the most rewarding. I am financially secure in these troubled times because I made the most of the opportunities the military gave me. Dump the whining dingbat. Ask Mom to hang on a bit longer. Go into the military...give it your all and do the best job you can. Then come back here a year from now and tell us if your life hasn't improved dramatically.",

        "reply": "tbthomas, It's too early for you to decide this isn't for you. Listen to those who have BTDT. At your age, and with your education, you aren't likely to find a legal job that pays better than the Army. You are just letting too many things pile up on you that aren't worth losing any sleep over. Here are some tips: 1. Lose the dingbat. If she won't stay steady with you while you go to basic, you sure as h---don't want to marry her. Why shackle yourself to someone with no staying power? So you don't go in the military, but you fall on hard times in the civilian world. Do you think this piece of fluff will stand by your side and meet any challenges? She'll be one of those who sits on her butt in front of the TV all day long and whines because she can't buy a new pair of shoes! 2. Basic is no easy deal, but it's only about 8 weeks long, right? And during that 8 weeks, you don't have to make any decisions. You'll be told where to be and when, what to wear and what to do. As long as you meet those basic requirements, you won't have a problem. Work on making sure you can handle the physical requirements before you start training and while you're cruising along, you'll be seeing all the others who didn't prepare, crying for their mothers. The best advice my dad gave me was \"always watch for the humor\". A lot of really funny stuff happens in basic. You can laugh your way all the way through. 3. Once you're done with basic, the Army will train you to do a job. But you know what? You will still have 2-3 years of simply doing what your told, when your told, in the uniform prescribed. Imagine that! Getting paid and not having to make any decisions while doing it! My son went off to the first gulf war, as an E-3 right out of advanced training. He called me to say he was just a bit scared at the prospect. I told him, you just do your job to the best of your ability and NCOs and officers will take care of you. He was assigned as a medic to a Hawk missile battery and he loved it. He is now making very good money in California as a Nurse in the civilian sector. He got almost all his medical training through the military. Along the way, he dumped his first wife (who had a lot in common with your girlfriend), and will soon marry a very sharp young woman who is a Captain in the regular AF. 3. Getting a steady job with the Army is the best way you can help your mom. As Elesso said, you'll have a steady income and very few personal expenses. Military housing for even lower ranking personnel is getting better every day. You'll have a nice place to live, the Army will feed you and take care of a lot of your clothing needs related to the job, and take care of your medical needs. In time, if you are supporting your mother, you may even be able to claim her as a dependent, making her eligible for medical care and other bennies. So, going into the Army may be the best decision you could make right now. It won't always be easy, but I've had a lot of jobs in my 60 years, and my military jobs were usually the best paying and the most rewarding. I am financially secure in these troubled times because I made the most of the opportunities the military gave me. Dump the whining dingbat. Ask Mom to hang on a bit longer. Go into the military...give it your all and do the best job you can. Then come back here a year from now and tell us if your life hasn't improved dramatically.",

If he wishes to help mom and to push forward into life, with a chance to succeed, he needs to STOP doing things just because his love interest doesn't agree with his career choices.

        "content": "tbthomas, It's too early for you to decide this isn't for you. Listen to those who have BTDT. At your age, and with your education, you aren't likely to find a legal job that pays better than the Army. You are just letting too many things pile up on you that aren't worth losing any sleep over. Here are some tips: 1. Lose the dingbat. If she won't stay steady with you while you go to basic, you sure as h---don't want to marry her. Why shackle yourself to someone with no staying power? So you don't go in the military, but you fall on hard times in the civilian world. Do you think this piece of fluff will stand by your side and meet any challenges? She'll be one of those who sits on her butt in front of the TV all day long and whines because she can't buy a new pair of shoes! 2. Basic is no easy deal, but it's only about 8 weeks long, right? And during that 8 weeks, you don't have to make any decisions. You'll be told where to be and when, what to wear and what to do. As long as you meet those basic requirements, you won't have a problem. Work on making sure you can handle the physical requirements before you start training and while you're cruising along, you'll be seeing all the others who didn't prepare, crying for their mothers. The best advice my dad gave me was \"always watch for the humor\". A lot of really funny stuff happens in basic. You can laugh your way all the way through. 3. Once you're done with basic, the Army will train you to do a job. But you know what? You will still have 2-3 years of simply doing what your told, when your told, in the uniform prescribed. Imagine that! Getting paid and not having to make any decisions while doing it! My son went off to the first gulf war, as an E-3 right out of advanced training. He called me to say he was just a bit scared at the prospect. I told him, you just do your job to the best of your ability and NCOs and officers will take care of you. He was assigned as a medic to a Hawk missile battery and he loved it. He is now making very good money in California as a Nurse in the civilian sector. He got almost all his medical training through the military. Along the way, he dumped his first wife (who had a lot in common with your girlfriend), and will soon marry a very sharp young woman who is a Captain in the regular AF. 3. Getting a steady job with the Army is the best way you can help your mom. As Elesso said, you'll have a steady income and very few personal expenses. Military housing for even lower ranking personnel is getting better every day. You'll have a nice place to live, the Army will feed you and take care of a lot of your clothing needs related to the job, and take care of your medical needs. In time, if you are supporting your mother, you may even be able to claim her as a dependent, making her eligible for medical care and other bennies. So, going into the Army may be the best decision you could make right now. It won't always be easy, but I've had a lot of jobs in my 60 years, and my military jobs were usually the best paying and the most rewarding. I am financially secure in these troubled times because I made the most of the opportunities the military gave me. Dump the whining dingbat. Ask Mom to hang on a bit longer. Go into the military...give it your all and do the best job you can. Then come back here a year from now and tell us if your life hasn't improved dramatically.",

It's about personal responsibility, not someone being there for you 24/7 because you feel a little ill. And as far as your \"girlfriend\"... \"who can stand (to) be away for so long\". Any girl worth her skirt will stand by you no matter what. I stood by my husband through basic training, and am still standing by him despite the fact that he's a disabled veteran. If you want to let a girl ruin your life because you don't want to be away from her, then by all means, go for it, it's your life. \"and the money you get from the army is not worth the energy put in\"-- Okay, that right there tells me that the Army is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU. It's not about the money kid, it's about Honor, Duty, Respect (for yourself and others) and standing up to fight for those that can't/won't. You obviously can't grasp that...",

If she won't stay steady with you while you go to basic, you sure as h---don't want to marry her. Why shackle yourself to someone with no staying power? So you don't go in the military, but you fall on hard times in the civilian world. Do you think this piece of fluff will stand by your side and meet any challenges? She'll be one of those who sits on her butt in front of the TV all day long and whines because she can't buy a new pair of shoes! 2. Basic is no easy deal, but it's only about 8 weeks long, right? And during that 8 weeks, you don't have to make any decisions. You'll be told where to be and when, what to wear and what to do. As long as you meet those basic requirements, you won't have a problem. Work on making sure you can handle the physical requirements before you start training and while you're cruising along, you'll be seeing all the others who didn't prepare, crying for their mothers. The best advice my dad gave me was \"always watch for the humor\". A lot of really funny stuff happens in basic. You can laugh your way all the way through. 3. Once you're done with basic, the Army will train you to do a job. But you know what? You will still have 2-3 years of simply doing what your told, when your told, in the uniform prescribed. Imagine that! Getting paid and not having to make any decisions while doing it! My son went off to the first gulf war, as an E-3 right out of advanced training. He called me to say he was just a bit scared at the prospect. I told him, you just do your job to the best of your ability and NCOs and officers will take care of you. He was assigned as a medic to a Hawk missile battery and he loved it. He is now making very good money in California as a Nurse in the civilian sector. He got almost all his medical training through the military. Along the way, he dumped his first wife (who had a lot in common with your girlfriend), and will soon marry a very sharp young woman who is a Captain in the regular AF. 3. Getting a steady job with the Army is the best way you can help your mom. As Elesso said, you'll have a steady income and very few personal expenses. Military housing for even lower ranking personnel is getting better every day. You'll have a nice place to live, the Army will feed you and take care of a lot of your clothing needs related to the job, and take care of your medical needs. In time, if you are supporting your mother, you may even be able to claim her as a dependent, making her eligible for medical care and other bennies. So, going into the Army may be the best decision you could make right now. It won't always be easy, but I've had a lot of jobs in my 60 years, and my military jobs were usually the best paying and the most rewarding. I am financially secure in these troubled times because I made the most of the opportunities the military gave me. Dump the whining dingbat. Ask Mom to hang on a bit longer. Go into the military...give it your all and do the best job you can. Then come back here a year from now and tell us if your life hasn't improved dramatically.",

If he wishes to help mom and to push forward into life, with a chance to succeed, he needs to STOP doing things just because his love interest doesn't agree with his career choices.

At your age, and with your education, you aren't likely to find a legal job that pays better than the Army. You are just letting too many things pile up on you that aren't worth losing any sleep over. Here are some tips: 1. Lose the dingbat. If she won't stay steady with you while you go to basic, you sure as h---don't want to marry her. Why shackle yourself to someone with no staying power? So you don't go in the military, but you fall on hard times in the civilian world. Do you think this piece of fluff will stand by your side and meet any challenges? She'll be one of those who sits on her butt in front of the TV all day long and whines because she can't buy a new pair of shoes! 2. Basic is no easy deal, but it's only about 8 weeks long, right? And during that 8 weeks, you don't have to make any decisions. You'll be told where to be and when, what to wear and what to do. As long as you meet those basic requirements, you won't have a problem. Work on making sure you can handle the physical requirements before you start training and while you're cruising along, you'll be seeing all the others who didn't prepare, crying for their mothers. The best advice my dad gave me was \"always watch for the humor\". A lot of really funny stuff happens in basic. You can laugh your way all the way through. 3. Once you're done with basic, the Army will train you to do a job. But you know what? You will still have 2-3 years of simply doing what your told, when your told, in the uniform prescribed. Imagine that! Getting paid and not having to make any decisions while doing it! My son went off to the first gulf war, as an E-3 right out of advanced training. He called me to say he was just a bit scared at the prospect. I told him, you just do your job to the best of your ability and NCOs and officers will take care of you. He was assigned as a medic to a Hawk missile battery and he loved it. He is now making very good money in California as a Nurse in the civilian sector. He got almost all his medical training through the military. Along the way, he dumped his first wife (who had a lot in common with your girlfriend), and will soon marry a very sharp young woman who is a Captain in the regular AF. 3. Getting a steady job with the Army is the best way you can help your mom. As Elesso said, you'll have a steady income and very few personal expenses. Military housing for even lower ranking personnel is getting better every day. You'll have a nice place to live, the Army will feed you and take care of a lot of your clothing needs related to the job, and take care of your medical needs. In time, if you are supporting your mother, you may even be able to claim her as a dependent, making her eligible for medical care and other bennies. So, going into the Army may be the best decision you could make right now. It won't always be easy, but I've had a lot of jobs in my 60 years, and my military jobs were usually the best paying and the most rewarding. I am financially secure in these troubled times because I made the most of the opportunities the military gave me. Dump the whining dingbat. Ask Mom to hang on a bit longer. Go into the military...give it your all and do the best job you can. Then come back here a year from now and tell us if your life hasn't improved dramatically.",

I thought you might just not be seeing the opportunities the military could offer. I missed the most important part of your first entry....17 yr old kid.",

After this last post I don't think it's your girlfriend or money stressing you out... \"things have to be done a certain way\" \"I need to know that medical attention is there for me\" ... dude, if you freaked out because they didn't wait on you hand a foot for dehydration (i.e., drink more water...) then you're right, the Army isn't for you. It's about personal responsibility, not someone being there for you 24/7 because you feel a little ill. And as far as your \"girlfriend\"... \"who can stand (to) be away for so long\". Any girl worth her skirt will stand by you no matter what. I stood by my husband through basic training, and am still standing by him despite the fact that he's a disabled veteran. If you want to let a girl ruin your life because you don't want to be away from her, then by all means, go for it, it's your life. \"and the money you get from the army is not worth the energy put in\"-- Okay, that right there tells me that the Army is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU. It's not about the money kid, it's about Honor, Duty, Respect (for yourself and others) and standing up to fight for those that can't/won't. You obviously can't grasp that...",

It sound to me that you aren't ready to cut the apron strings and are making up excuses.

That's a line of bullshyyt!! You either got guts enough to be a Man or you don't. Buck UP or be a f!@#$k up! Either way, doesn't matter to me. There is nothing in the Army that is any tougher than going out for football, wrestling, or boxing. Probably ain't even that tough anymore, being co-ed and all... You sound like a whiner wimp that's looking for sympathy for being a pathetic loser!! Get some back bone and be a Man, or drop dead! Wandering and Wondering",
