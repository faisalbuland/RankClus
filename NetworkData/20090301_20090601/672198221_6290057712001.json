John Shimkus has been in office for the 19th District since 03; he was preceded by Phelps who was only in office for four years. Glenn Poshard was before him for 10 years. That covers both Southern Illinois distrcits for the last 20 years. I would have to guess you are talking about Melvin Price who was before Costello and he was in Congress from 1944 until his death 1988, but that was more than a few years ago.",

        "reply": " Jerry Costello is in office now for the 12th District and has been since 88. John Shimkus has been in office for the 19th District since 03; he was preceded by Phelps who was only in office for four years. Glenn Poshard was before him for 10 years. That covers both Southern Illinois distrcits for the last 20 years. I would have to guess you are talking about Melvin Price who was before Costello and he was in Congress from 1944 until his death 1988, but that was more than a few years ago.",
