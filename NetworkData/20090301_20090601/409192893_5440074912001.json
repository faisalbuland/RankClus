The CRA was passed by the 95th United States Congress and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. As far as CRA being responsible for the mess we have now it depends on who you listen to. Some say yes, some say no. Relation to 2008 financial crisis See also: Subprime mortgage crisis and Global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 Some economists, politicians and other commentators have charged that the CRA contributed in part to the 2008 financial crisis by encouraging banks to make unsafe loans. Others however, including the economists from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, dispute this contention. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC holds that empirical research has not validated any relationship between the CRA and the 2008 financial crisis.[56][57] Economist Stan Liebowitz wrote in the New York Post that a strengthening of the CRA in the 1990s encouraged a loosening of lending standards throughout the banking industry. He also charges the Federal Reserve with ignoring the negative impact of the CRA.[51] In a commentary for CNN, Congressman Ron Paul, who serves on the United States House Committee on Financial Services, charged the CRA with \"forcing banks to lend to people who normally would be rejected as bad credit risks.\"[58] In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Austrian school economist Russell Roberts wrote that the CRA subsidized low-income housing by pressuring banks to serve poor borrowers and poor regions of the country.[59] Jeffrey A. Miron, a senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University, in an opinion piece for CNN, calls for \u201cgetting rid\u201d of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as policies like the Community Reinvestment Act that \u201cpressure banks into subprime lending.\u201d[60] However, others dispute the involvement of the CRA in the subprime crisis. San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank Governor Randall Kroszner has stated that the claim that \"the law pushed banking institutions to undertake high-risk mortgage lending\" was contrary to their experience, and that no empirical evidence had been presented to support the claim.[56] In a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) working paper, economist Luci Ellis concluded that \"there is no evidence that the Community Reinvestment Act was responsible for encouraging the subprime lending boom and subsequent housing bust,\" relying partly on evidence that the housing bust has been a largely exurban event.[61] Others have also concluded that the CRA did not contribute to the financial crisis, for example, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair,[62] Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan,[63] Tim Westrich of the Center for American Progress,[64] Robert Gordon of the American Prospect,[65] Daniel Gross of Slate, and Aaron Pressman from BusinessWeek.[66] Some legal and financial experts note that CRA regulated loans tend to be safe and profitable, and that subprime excesses came mainly from institutions not regulated by the CRA. In the February 2008 House hearing, law professor Michael S. Barr, a Treasury Department official under President Clinton,[67][34] stated that a Federal Reserve survey showed that affected institutions considered CRA loans profitable and not overly risky. He noted that approximately 50% of the subprime loans were made by independent mortgage companies that were not regulated by the CRA, and another 25% to 30% came from only partially CRA regulated bank subsidiaries and affiliates. Barr noted that institutions fully regulated by CRA made \"perhaps one in four\" sub-prime loans, and that \"the worst and most widespread abuses occurred in the institutions with the least federal oversight\".[68] According to Janet L. Yellen, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, independent mortgage companies made risky \"high-priced loans\" at more than twice the rate of the banks and thrifts; most CRA loans were responsibly made, and were not the higher-priced loans that have contributed to the current crisis.[69] A 2008 study by Traiger & Hinckley LLP, a law firm that counsels financial institutions on CRA compliance, found that CRA regulated institutions were less likely to make subprime loans, and when they did the interest rates were lower. CRA banks were also half as likely to resell the loans.[70] Emre Ergungor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that there was no statistical difference in foreclosure rates between regulated and less-regulated banks, although a local bank presence resulted in fewer foreclosures.[71] During a 2008 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the financial crisis, including in relation to the Community Reinvestment Act, asked if the CRA provided the \u201cfuel\u201d for increasing subprime loans, former Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines said it might have been a catalyst encouraging bad behavior, but it was difficult to know. Raines also cited information that only a small percentage of risky loans originated as a result of the CRA. Bob McTeer, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank from 1991 to 2004, said \u201cThere was a lot of pressure from Congress and generally everywhere to make homeownership affordable for poor and low-income people. Some mortgages were made that would not have ordinarily been made.\u201d He also said \u201cWhen a bank made a decision to purchase mortgaged-backed securities, they would somehow determine if some of them were in zip codes covered by the CRA, and therefore they could get CRA credit.\u201d[72][73] >>>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act#Relation_to_2008_financial_crisis For a quick rundown I've posted what Wiki has.

Who 'strengthened' it? Legislative changes 1989 The Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) was enacted by the 101st Congress and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush in the wake of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. As part of a general reform of the banking industry, it increased public oversight of the process of issuing CRA ratings to banks. It required the agencies to issue CRA ratings publicly and written performance evaluations using facts and data to support the agencies' conclusions. It also required a four-tiered CRA examination rating system with performance levels of 'Outstanding', 'Satisfactory', 'Needs to Improve', or 'Substantial Noncompliance'.[15] According to Ben Bernanke, this law greatly increased the ability of advocacy groups, researchers, and other analysts to \"perform more-sophisticated, quantitative analyses of banks' records,\" thereby influencing the lending policies of banks. Over time, community groups and nonprofit organizations established \"more-formalized and more-productive partnerships with banks.\"[9] [edit] Legislative changes 1992 Although not part of the CRA, in order to achieve similar aims the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 required Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government sponsored enterprises that purchase and securitize mortgages, to devote a percentage of their lending to support affordable housing.[9] In October 2000, in order to expand the secondary market for affordable community-based mortgages and to increase liquidity for CRA-eligible loans, Fannie Mae committed to purchase and securitize $2 billion of \"MyCommunityMortgage\" loans.[20][21] In November 2000 Fannie Mae announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) would soon require it to dedicate 50% of its business to low- and moderate-income families.\" It stated that since 1997 Fannie Mae had done nearly $7 billion in CRA business with depository institutions, but its goal was $20 billion.[22] In 2001 Fannie Mae announced that it had acquired $10 billion in specially-targeted Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) loans more than one and a half years ahead of schedule, and announced its goal to finance over $500 billion in CRA business by 2010, about one third of loans anticipated to be financed by Fannie Mae during that period.[23] [edit] Legislative changes 1994 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which repealed restrictions on interstate banking, listed the CRA ratings received by the out-of-state bank as a consideration when determining whether to allow interstate branches.[24] According to Bernanke, a surge in bank merger and acquisition activities followed the passing of the act, and advocacy groups increasingly used the public comment process to protest bank applications on CRA grounds. When applications were highly contested, federal agencies held public hearings to allow public comment on the bank's lending record. In response many institutions established separate business units and subsidiary corporations to facilitate CRA-related lending. Local and regional public-private partnerships and multi-bank loan consortia were formed to expand and manage such CRA-related lending.[9] [edit] Regulatory changes 1995 In July 1993, President Clinton asked regulators to reform the CRA in order to make examinations more consistent, clarify performance standards, and reduce cost and compliance burden.[15] Robert Rubin, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, under President Clinton, explained that this was in line with President Clinton's strategy to \"deal with the problems of the inner city and distressed rural communities\". Discussing the reasons for the Clinton administration's proposal to strengthen the CRA and further reduce red-lining, Lloyd Bentsen, Secretary of the Treasury at that time, affirmed his belief that availability of credit should not depend on where a person lives, \"The only thing that ought to matter on a loan application is whether or not you can pay it back, not where you live.\" Bentsen said that the proposed changes would \"make it easier for lenders to show how they're complying with the Community Reinvestment Act\", and \"cut back a lot of the paperwork and the cost on small business loans\".[13] In 1995, the CRA regulations were substantially revised to address criticisms that the regulations, and the agencies' implementation of them through the examination process, were too process-oriented, burdensome, and not sufficiently focused on actual results. The agencies also changed the CRA examination process to incorporate these revisions.[15] Information about banking institutions' CRA ratings were made available via web page for public comment.[13] The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also revised its regulations, allowing lenders subject to the CRA to claim community development loan credits for loans made to help finance the environmental cleanup or redevelopment of industrial sites when it was part of an effort to revitalize the low- and moderate-income community where the site was located.[25] During March 1995 congressional hearings William A. Niskanen, chair of the Cato Institute, criticized the proposals for political favoritism in allocating credit and micromanagement by regulators, and that there was no assurance that banks would not be expected to operate at a loss. He predicted they would be very costly to the economy and banking system, and that the primary long term effect would be to contract the banking system. He recommended Congress repeal the Act.[26] Responding to concerns that the CRA would lower bank profitability, a 1997 research paper by economists at the Federal Reserve found that \"[CRA] lenders active in lower-income neighborhoods and with lower-income borrowers appear to be as profitable as other mortgage-oriented commercial banks\".[27] Speaking in 2007, Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke noted that, \"managers of financial institutions found that these loan portfolios, if properly underwritten and managed, could be profitable\" and that the loans \"usually did not involve disproportionately higher levels of default\".[9] According to a 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends in 305 U.S. cities between 1993 and 1998, $467 billion in mortgage credit flowed from CRA-covered lenders to low- and medium-income borrowers and areas. In that period, the total number of loans to poorer Americans by CRA-eligible institutions rose by 39% while loans to wealthier individuals by CRA-covered institutions rose by 17%. The share of total US lending to low and medium income borrowers rose from 25% in 1993 to 28% in 1998 as a consequence. [28] In October 1997, First Union Capital Markets and Bear, Stearns & Co launched the first publicly available securitization of Community Reinvestment Act loans, issuing $384.6 million of such securities. The securities were guaranteed by Freddie Mac and had an implied \"AAA\" rating.[29][22] The public offering was several times oversubscribed, predominantly by money managers and insurance companies who were not buying them for CRA credit.[30] [edit] Legislative changes 1999 In 1999 the Congress enacted and President Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the \"Financial Services Modernization Act,\" which repealed the part of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services. The bill was killed in 1998 because Senator Phil Gramm wanted the bill to expand the number of banks which no longer would be covered by the CRA. He also demanded full disclosure of any financial deals which community groups had with banks, accusing such groups of \"extortion.\" In 1999 Senators Christopher Dodd and Charles E. Schumer broke another deadlock by forcing a compromise between Gramm and the Clinton administration which wanted to prevent banks from expanding into insurance or securities unless they were compliant with the CRA. In the final compromise, the CRA would cover bank expansions into new lines of business, community groups would have to disclose certain kinds of financial deals with banks, and smaller banks would be reviewed less frequently for CRA compliance.[31][32][33] On signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act , President Clinton said that it, \"establishes the principles that, as we expand the powers of banks, we will expand the reach of the [Community Reinvestment] Act\".[34] Cut and paste is the only answer I have. However, it looks like the same deregulation (repeal of Glass-Steagall Act) that precipitated the current excess of financial criminality put the CRA at risk (not strengthened) as well. The repubs wrote and the demo President signed what has pretty much allowed the crooks to run the jailhouse. It just goes to prove that neither the repubs nor the demos have a lock on crooked politicians. It also proves that most everyone will lay the blame on those they want to, facts be damned.",
