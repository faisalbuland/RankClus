Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Colin Kahl told The Associated Press that the military will continue to watch whether increased violence may push back deadlines for U.S. troop withdrawals ordered by President Barack Obama. \"Are we likely to see the ebb and flow of violence as our posture changes, and as the enemy tries to probe the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces, or demonstrate that they're still relevant? Yes,\" Kahl said during a 30-minute interview at the Pentagon. \"I think we are likely to see that. But I don't know that we're anticipating a substantial increase.\"\u201d http://www.military.com/news/article/dod-expects-more-a...=1186032310810&wh=wh President Obama has always said that his deadline for withdraw could be adjusted depending on circumstances on the ground. But the date for withdraw of \u201cAll American forces\u201d from Iraq (12-31-2011) agreed to by President Bush has the force of law in Iraq. It cannot be changed except by a vote in the Iraqi Parliament. Since all the groups that caused the violence to go out of control in 2006 are still capable of causing violence, why would they not increase the violence as American troops draw down? The Sunni insurgency still has reasons to bring down the Iraqi government, and has never stopped trying. All al Qaeda in Iraq has to do is hold until 12-31-2011 and they will declare victory over the United States and continue to destabilize the Iraq government.",
