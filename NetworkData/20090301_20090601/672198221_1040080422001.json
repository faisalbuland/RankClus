But that's still not enough, right???? Ya have to disrupt the military too. You're the one always bringing race into the Gay Rights issue, well, it seems , with your own admission, gay Rights have gone further in just two decades than blacks in a century, but still not enough, right? I suppose that if an open homosexual ran for POTUS you'd vote for him/her, regardless if they're qualified or not, just to prove something, right????? Exactly....There is no thought of Country anymore, if its a woman, gay, or minority that is enough of a qualification. We cannot be in the business of hurting anyones feelings after all. BTW: I'm Hispanic. The real story is that a majority of the people voted for him in an OPEN election, knowing that he is gay. The fact that he is gay did not bother a majority of the voters, so they must have voted him for other reasons, presumably his stand on the issues that concern most Coloradans in his area. Thats fine, but some here and in other locales only worried about his sexuality. Not one word about his qualification, previous experience or anything. Someone told me recently, \"Wouldn't it be great to have a Hispanic President now that we have a Black one?\" well, my response was as honest as I could be, \"I want the best man for the job, if he happens to be white, black, brown I don't care...what the hell does that matter? Is skin color and ethnicity going to solve problems?\" I'm just so sick of it already.... Its happening with the Supreme Court Pick....Sen.Boxer from California said it best: \"We want the most qualified person on the Supreme Court, and you know, there are alot of great women out there.\" You got to be an idiot to not read between the lines.. Take my word for it, As a Hispanic guy in his early twenties the thing I hate the most right now, even after three tours in Iraq and Afghan, is the Political Correctness culture the Liberals have created....",

The only good thing about this dump belongs to mother nature. Are you? Really? Man, if you are, you could do me a big favor. I've been trying to find one of the best soldiers that I ever had. His name was Philip M Sanchez. He came into my plt as a pvt E2 back in the late 70s and left as a buck sgt, that was hard to do back then but he deserved every promotion. I tried my damndest to get him to make it a career, he would have gone far. I would have put him in for the Sgt Morales Club if I could have. Here's all the info I remember about him other than his name. His nickname was \"kid bush\". He was married or about to get married and had a son he too called \"kid bush\". He worked before he enlisted for the Post Office in LA and I'm sure that's where he went back to for work and is probably retired now, maybe. He served with me in C Btry 75th FA (Charlie Pride). I would really appreciate it. I tried one time by calling info for LA, the operator almost busted out laughing when she asked if I had time to write all the numbers down. I knew then I couldn't afford the phone bill.",
