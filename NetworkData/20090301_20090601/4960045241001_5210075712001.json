Our Visitors don't speak to communicate, rather they communicate through Symbolism by occupying our skies, abductions, and by disarmament of Nuclear Missiles stored in military bases across the globe. They, as in many Civilizations, come here, unarmed to help the world disarm itself from our own destruction. Every ET craft or UFO that had been fired upon never retaliated, instead, pulled miraculous speeds and maneuvers, disappearing into the sky. Some have even jammed the radars of pursuing pilots of armed jet fighters to defend themselves. What do these reports of pursuit and Take down ET Crafts hovering our skies symbolize? Domination and The Lust for Harvesting and Utilize Alien Technology to create *DeathTech. DeathTech meaning, WMD's. Possibilities for the Technology we have of theirs will not be made use for the benefit of every day life, instead, spend an untold number of years to research ways to take lives than to help give it. Sadly, they continue to tread this path by continuing their production patterns. We are destined for self destruction. Are we still primitive? That question is asked a countless number of times and the answer is, Yes. Primitive not as in the caveman times, but as in the way we have dealt with things through history. Examples, Conquering/claiming/taking of ones territory, and on the rise,\"The need to take,Territory in Space\". Our actions are primitive and that pertains to the way we use Technology. It is the thought of \"If we can't have, We take it\" and \"Destroy anything that we fail to understand\". Through the years we have done that to our planet, but space remained calm except the booms from dieing stars. Conflicts were made on earth, but in space, civilizations made no conflicts. Now in our age, our quest to weaponize space is about to change things for the worst. There are other civilizations that Occupy Space, not just us; however, they are what is keeping the peace out there. As humans, we see peace through a treaty, a signature on paper. If that fails, we force it. The label Violent remains permanent below the title Human and to some of us it still lies there, at a dormant state. So have we made ourselves unwelcome in this universe to continue on with the rest to travel across the stars, into a gateway that branches another Universe so that we live on when our Current Universe reaches that 5th Era? The answer is Yes. Until we prove and break sweat for achieving true peace by eliminating all of the worlds WMD's. It is obvious why they keep the eye over us, why sightings are so common upon the people. Our actions show them that we are violent and for that, I am nowhere near in a Proud state of mind. The Weaponization of Space is Unnecessary and is disruption to the peace within our neighbors lightyears away from us. Why are mass numbers of witnesses afraid to go public with their story? It is the fear of Ridicule. People who host at Fox News air a legit sighting, then get a chuckle here and there. It's the feeling that nobody will believe you, and you could lose your job, possibly lose your wife, and like one man, had all that happen to him, plus the burning of his house. What in the Human mind thinks that we are the only, walking, living things that occupy the universe? After wall, we were all created from Space Dust. The Iron, ect. It can be found in Star Nurseries. People whom have been abducted, or have seen a legit UFO that should by common sense be considered alien, have been laughed at to the point where all is lost. Lets break it down shall we? Referring back up to what I had just mentioned fear of ridicule. Abductees and Ufo Witnesses who want to believe are not the crazy ones. They are not ignorant like the rest. Facts show hundreds upon thousands of evidence in reports. Most of which contain key recordings, like Holts recording at Rendlesham forest. The indentations the craft left after taking off and the radiation levels that were recorded there. Ignorant debunkers and skeptics have made no succession in legit UFO sightings. Notice they don't leave their name on their claims on what it might be, example, Weather balloon/Flare attached together theory because they are afraid of backfire. To even think most of us have absolutely no common sense to pass off a theory so adolescent, unsophisticated, brainless, dumb, idiotic and moronic claim like Flares and Weather balloons tied together to take triangle formation also takes someone whom is beyond feeble-minded. That theory was tested and their flare/Weather balloon theory was swept away like a Tsunami hitting a wasp head on. The lighthouse theory of one of the many incidents at Rendlesham Forest was proven absurd due to the light being 3 miles away from the farmhouse and the intensity of the glow and only had aim out towards the sea because of the metal plating, not enough to be compared to what was seen, in addition to that, was nowhere near the line of sight that the UFO appeared at. Second, A lighthouse does not glow red like this did, and third, a lighthouse cannot in any way speed off to the farmhouse, shoot a beam down, then explode into 5 other miniature orbs and takeoff at unimaginable speeds you. If someone believes that a lighthouse can do that, please go hide yourself when disclosure day comes. That there is the first piece of bread with cheese, ham and mayo. We are almost there, Second incident. The Triangle ufo, glowed intensely, it left a strong static charge the witnesses said as he touched the side of the craft, then, it took off at extreme speeds through the forest floor then shot off in the sky. In 1980 there were no craft with that capability and there are not today no matter how secret you want to call the military's air projects. It left \"three depressions 1 1/2\" deep and 7\" in diameter were found where the object had been sighted on the ground. The following night (29 Dec 80) the area was checked for radiation. Beta/gamma readings of 0.1 milliroentgens were recorded with peak readings in the three depressions and near the center of the triangle formed by the depressions. A nearby tree had moderate (.05 - .07) readings on the side of the tree toward the depressions. \" You see, witnesses are like bits and pieces of a broken key, you get all of them and mold them together, you are only a couple steps away from unlocking the secret. It helps if whomever you are come forward. We are not weird, we just have more common sense to realize what things really are and what they are not. We can differentiate better. Why should witnesses be afraid when Debunkers debunking the truth don't have the balls to publish a theory that would take a mere five year old to think up in their name. If you feel you have to do so, just every one of you deniers prepare for your day of ridicule when disclosure comes to full effect. I surely hope suicide rises amongst them from daily humiliation. I, as a strong Gary McKinnon supporter, will say this,\"You can't hide a secret forever, and if you continue to do so there will be an increase of people with knowledge compared to him. Cyber Militias will be on the rise and a matter of time Riots/Foot Militias will run a muck, and the agenda will be \"The Freedom to Know\". I strongly suggest, as one person and maybe many others, that you do not weaponize their technology or even try to, no matter whose hands it is in. Nuclear weapons are bad enough as it is in ANYBODIES hands. It has been proven that Intelligent Civilizations that have advanced rapidly are on a quick trip for their own destruction.

She asked to meet with me and I met with her and she informed me that President Carter, upon taking office in January 1977, held a meeting within the Director of Central Intelligence, who was George Bush Senior and demanded that the Director of Central Intelligence turn over to the President the classified information about Unidentified Flying Objects, and the information was in the possession of the United States Intelligence Community concerning the existence of \u201cExtra Terrestrial Intelligence\u201d.

Daniel Salter: U.S. Air Force, Chief Master Sergeant \u2013 NRO I would go and interview people who would claim they had seen something and try to convince them they hadn\u2019t seen something or they were hallucinating or something. Well if that didn\u2019t work, another team would come in, Give all the threats, and threaten your family and so and so forth.

And they\u2019re you know, its basically that for 8 or 9 hours\u2026They\u2019re just off on their own, there\u2019s no oversight, no control, they just do whatever they want. They\u2019re evil, these people are evil. Unable to Identify National Security Council National Security Planning Group No Congressional Oversight Basically its an oversight group, inner-mingled with the National Security Council and the National Security Planning Group. They have full control, they have NO congressional oversight what so ever, they answer to nobody. Except for the President of the United States, but they\u2019re trying to push aside away from the President. Dr. Carol Rosin: Aerospace Executive \u2013 Fairchild Industries When I was a Corporate Manager of Fairchild Industries in 1974 through 77, I met Dr. Wernher von Braun in early 74. At that time, Von Braun was dying of cancer, but he assured me that he would live a few more years in order to tell me about the game that was being played. That game being the effort to, \u201cWeaponize Space.\u201d Von Braun\u2019s purpose in life during the last years of his life, his dying years, was to educate the public and decision makers, of why space based weapons are a dumb, dangerous, destabilizing, too costly, unnecessary, unworkable, undesirable. The strategy that Wernher von Braun taught me is at first the Russians are going to be considered the enemy, when I met him in 74, they were the enemy. They identified the enemy. We were told they had killer satellites, we were told they were coming to get us and control us, the dirty commi\u2019s that whole story. But first the Russians were the enemy in which whom we are going to build space based weapons against. In 1977 I was in a meeting in Fairchild Industries in their conference room called the War Room, and in that room were a lot of charts on the walls with enemies, enemies in which people have never heard of. Names like Saddam Hussein and Kadafi. We were then talking about terrorists, the potential terrorist. No one had ever talked about this before. But this was the next stage after the Russians, of whom we were going to build space based weapons. These terrorists. This is 1977 and they were talking about, Creating a war in the Gulf Region where there was 25 billion dollars in the space based weapons program, that yet, had not been identified. It wasn\u2019t called the Strategic Defense Initiative at least until 1983. This weapons system had obviously been going on for some time, that I didn\u2019t know anything about. So I stood up in this meeting in 1977 and then said, \u201cI\u2019d like to know why we\u2019re talking about Space Based Weapons against these enemies? Id like to know more about this, would someone tell me more on what this is about.\u201d And nobody answered. They went on with this meeting as if I hadn\u2019t said anything. We heard a lot about terrorism, then we were going to hear about 3rd world country crazies we now call the Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the 3rd enemy that\u2019s whom would be needing to build Space Based Weapons. And the next enemy was Asteroids. Now at this point, he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. Asteroids. Against Asteroids we\u2019re going to build space based weapons. So it was funny then. And the funniest one of all, Was what he called Aliens, Extra Terrestrials.\u201d That would be the final card. And over, and over, and over, during the four years that I knew him, and was giving his speeches for him, he would bring up that last card, and remember now, and that last card, is the alien card. You have to build space based weapons against Aliens. And all of it he said. Was A LIE John Maynard: Retired Military Intelligence Analyst \u2013 Army Security, DEA Weapons in space is still a big enigma. Black covert operations have always been trying to do something like that. They wanted a weapons system they could put in space that would stop a ballistic missile. That was the concept. When star wars was brought out as an idea which was before Reagan, it had incorporated into his administration. There was a lot of truth on what they wanted to do, and they knew the basic principal on what they wanted to do. Dr. Paul Czysz: United States Air Force \u2013 McDonald Douglas Engineer The ballistic missile is probably, a pipe drain in the sense that, if what it\u2019s designed for that you know where its coming from. And when we had Russia, there was a 50/50 chance that you knew about where it would be coming from. With the rogue nations we have today its absolutely ludicrous. Don Phillips: United States Air Force - Lockheed Skunkworks [U]Well if they were hostile, my own knowledge is, in feeling. I don\u2019t know about all of them, is that we could have been uh, their weaponry as it might be used, could\u2019ve destroyed us a LONG time ago.[/U] Dr. Paul Czysz of the United States Air Force. Continues on [U]If beings can travel in time space, then anything we put in as a weapon would be like going against Genghis Khan with a fire cracker.[/U] Daniel Salter of the U.S. Air Force, adds in the conversation Now some would like for us to believe that, the idea that Aliens and People are enemy now. But that\u2019s not true. John Maynard: who is a Retired Military Intelligence Analyst adds to the conversation I noticed the satellites positions, and I said, \u201cNow this is supposed to be a system that tracks radar anomalies on Earth\u201d you know the whole thing moving, and he says that\u2019s what it does, and I say \u201cWhy are half of them pointing towards outer space?\u201d Towards the Moon, Towards areas where there is just quiet space. Sergeant Clifford Stone: US Army \u2013 Extraterrestrial Retrieval Team I have concluded, that we are fighting against the clock. I have got a short time, to convince people that we are moving to the point where we are going to Militarize Space. As we saw Militarizing space, we are going to acquire new technology, we are going to evolve in technology John Maynard: who is a Retired Military Intelligence Analyst adds to the conversation [I]At least half of those satellites you have up there, aren\u2019t looking at earth [Unknown] You have to receive, several transmissions from the Pentagon and from the other Satellite monitoring the station at the NSA that they were tracking ETV\u2019s. Extra Terrestrial. That stands for Extra Terrestrial Vehicles. John Maynard: who is a Retired Military Intelligence Analyst adds to the conversation And I says, \u201cWhat are they looking for?\u201d and he says, \u201cwell you got to have a Need To Know to know about that.\u201d Daniel Salter of the U.S. Air Force, adds in the conversation We put nuclear weapons Out. In. Space! That was a line of defense, and we was ready to blow em up if they started in. Dr. Carol Rosin: Aerospace Executive for Fairchild Industries, continues the conversation He didn\u2019t mention a timeline, but he said it was going to be speeding up faster than anybody could possibly imagine. NASA Broadcast Live at NASA: Ok, uhhhh, we\u2019re not jokin about this but uhhh, was that window 1 where we saw an object floating nearby, we took several pictures of it, its uhhh very small CNN Shuttle Trouble? We just heard that in the process of, pouring over that Heat Shield they found, 3 more objects floating, in close proximity to the space shuttle Atlantis, here we go, 1\u20262\u2026and 3.. uhh unclear on what those are. Maybe a fourth there, uh I\u2019m not clear what those are. It could be Ice, it could be, it could be little pieces of harmless debris, worst case scenario is that it could be part of that heat shield, that is why NASA is concerned. Another News Station [I]Uhh, its very hard to be able to identify on what those little things might be If you love this country, You would respect and trust those who had fought and did their duty to defend it whom are now speaking out about the dark truth of what is now still today, going on militarily. Life matters, but it is better to be remembered as someone that has tried to fight against the biggest conspiracy theory since the time our visitors showed up in our skies. There are possibly more than 400 witnesses ready to go to congress right now and that majority has served in the United States Military, and have undergone Harsh criticism that they do not deserve. They need to be announced as Hero\u2019s of this time and place before they pass on to the next life with their knowledge. I understand conspiracies are hard to prove, especially when they are involved with our government here. You have 400+ witnesses that have been there, and seen it and heard it and are not afraid to speak. Those 400 stand strong, and they are not dead. The opportunity to change the world is here, support them. If you know anyone who could be of extreme help, contact them and let them know about The Disclosure Project. Its not crazy when your doing the right thing, and don\u2019t let these men they talk about threaten you to hush. These are troubled times, listen to the witness testimonies, its all there. Think, if you got caught in a situation like theirs, would you want other people to know? I would not and do not stand for a people that threaten a family because of something the public really needs to know of I have typed this out, I did not enjoy it. I used some of the witness testimonies from \u201cUFO\u2019s: The greatest story ever denied\u201d. It is something that people have to know and if we don\u2019t we are all going to pay a price because of these people. Im not crazy, but saying they have not visited us is just like saying they don\u2019t exist at all. After all, they do have a better eye in space than we do.",

Dr. Paul Czysz: United States Air Force \u2013 McDonald Douglas Engineer The ballistic missile is probably, a pipe drain in the sense that, if what it\u2019s designed for that you know where its coming from. And when we had Russia, there was a 50/50 chance that you knew about where it would be coming from. With the rogue nations we have today its absolutely ludicrous. Don Phillips: United States Air Force - Lockheed Skunkworks [U]Well if they were hostile, my own knowledge is, in feeling. I don\u2019t know about all of them, is that we could have been uh, their weaponry as it might be used, could\u2019ve destroyed us a LONG time ago.[/U] Dr. Paul Czysz of the United States Air Force. Continues on [U]If beings can travel in time space, then anything we put in as a weapon would be like going against Genghis Khan with a fire cracker.[/U] Daniel Salter of the U.S. Air Force, adds in the conversation Now some would like for us to believe that, the idea that Aliens and People are enemy now. But that\u2019s not true. John Maynard: who is a Retired Military Intelligence Analyst adds to the conversation I noticed the satellites positions, and I said, \u201cNow this is supposed to be a system that tracks radar anomalies on Earth\u201d you know the whole thing moving, and he says that\u2019s what it does, and I say \u201cWhy are half of them pointing towards outer space?\u201d Towards the Moon, Towards areas where there is just quiet space. Sergeant Clifford Stone: US Army \u2013 Extraterrestrial Retrieval Team I have concluded, that we are fighting against the clock. I have got a short time, to convince people that we are moving to the point where we are going to Militarize Space. As we saw Militarizing space, we are going to acquire new technology, we are going to evolve in technology John Maynard: who is a Retired Military Intelligence Analyst adds to the conversation [I]At least half of those satellites you have up there, aren\u2019t looking at earth [Unknown] You have to receive, several transmissions from the Pentagon and from the other Satellite monitoring the station at the NSA that they were tracking ETV\u2019s. Extra Terrestrial. That stands for Extra Terrestrial Vehicles. John Maynard: who is a Retired Military Intelligence Analyst adds to the conversation And I says, \u201cWhat are they looking for?\u201d and he says, \u201cwell you got to have a Need To Know to know about that.\u201d Daniel Salter of the U.S. Air Force, adds in the conversation We put nuclear weapons Out. In. Space! That was a line of defense, and we was ready to blow em up if they started in. Dr. Carol Rosin: Aerospace Executive for Fairchild Industries, continues the conversation He didn\u2019t mention a timeline, but he said it was going to be speeding up faster than anybody could possibly imagine. NASA Broadcast Live at NASA: Ok, uhhhh, we\u2019re not jokin about this but uhhh, was that window 1 where we saw an object floating nearby, we took several pictures of it, its uhhh very small CNN Shuttle Trouble? We just heard that in the process of, pouring over that Heat Shield they found, 3 more objects floating, in close proximity to the space shuttle Atlantis, here we go, 1\u20262\u2026and 3.. uhh unclear on what those are. Maybe a fourth there, uh I\u2019m not clear what those are. It could be Ice, it could be, it could be little pieces of harmless debris, worst case scenario is that it could be part of that heat shield, that is why NASA is concerned. Another News Station [I]Uhh, its very hard to be able to identify on what those little things might be If you love this country, You would respect and trust those who had fought and did their duty to defend it whom are now speaking out about the dark truth of what is now still today, going on militarily. Life matters, but it is better to be remembered as someone that has tried to fight against the biggest conspiracy theory since the time our visitors showed up in our skies. There are possibly more than 400 witnesses ready to go to congress right now and that majority has served in the United States Military, and have undergone Harsh criticism that they do not deserve. They need to be announced as Hero\u2019s of this time and place before they pass on to the next life with their knowledge. I understand conspiracies are hard to prove, especially when they are involved with our government here. You have 400+ witnesses that have been there, and seen it and heard it and are not afraid to speak. Those 400 stand strong, and they are not dead. The opportunity to change the world is here, support them. If you know anyone who could be of extreme help, contact them and let them know about The Disclosure Project. Its not crazy when your doing the right thing, and don\u2019t let these men they talk about threaten you to hush. These are troubled times, listen to the witness testimonies, its all there. Think, if you got caught in a situation like theirs, would you want other people to know? I would not and do not stand for a people that threaten a family because of something the public really needs to know of I have typed this out, I did not enjoy it. I used some of the witness testimonies from \u201cUFO\u2019s: The greatest story ever denied\u201d. It is something that people have to know and if we don\u2019t we are all going to pay a price because of these people. Im not crazy, but saying they have not visited us is just like saying they don\u2019t exist at all. After all, they do have a better eye in space than we do.",
