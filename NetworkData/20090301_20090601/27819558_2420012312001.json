The therapy lasts about a month and is terminated by the patient--no diagnoses are made and no medicine is prescribed--but there is still, within those mental health records, written evidence that the patient had the propensity to engage in homosexual conduct. Two years later, this person, who is no longer curious about same-sex attractions and leads a straight lifestyle, wants to enlist. At MEPS he or she will have to produce records of ALL therapy, and the doctor will discover evidence of homosexual behavior and relations. Is this disqualifying for entry? Even if this evidence only pertains to prior homosexual conduct, and they sign off or swear to being straight? Or is this a barrier to enlistment/commission?",
