I know that the there is nothing the United States can do to deal with the 1,350 year split between the Sunni and Shia. Then there is the Kurd-Arab feud. You know these people are going to keep killing each other no matter what Americans do. I know that these generational feuds will not stop unless there is someone like Saddam to oppress them.

There is no \"dealing\" with Sunni, Shia violence. What, we're going to mediate 2000 years of hate and blood? Ya, lets all sit down and sing songs around the camp fire.. oh wait thats O's plan.", 
        "reply": " Don\u2019t see where anyone blamed President Bush for the Sunni-Shia violence. It is true that he never dealt with the causes of the violence in Iraq. The \u201csurge\u201d plan was just to bring down the violence from when it was out of control in 2006. The \u201csurge\u201d allowed bushies to say \u201cwe are succeeding in Iraq\u201d while ignoring the real problems that caused the violence to go out of control in the first place. I know that the there is nothing the United States can do to deal with the 1,350 year split between the Sunni and Shia. Then there is the Kurd-Arab feud. You know these people are going to keep killing each other no matter what Americans do. I know that these generational feuds will not stop unless there is someone like Saddam to oppress them. How come a smart guy like G.W. Bush, who got elected President, didn\u2019t know what we know about the Iraqi people?",
