I support affirmative action, but I realize that providing opportunity to some worthy individuals can mean denying opportunity to others. Thinking about some issues involves discerning among subtly graded shades of gray. On some issues, though, I really don\u2019t see anything but black and white.

When you have a minority group such as LGBT folks who have been looked down upon for decades by the majority of the public, you cannot expect this public majority to vote in favor of giving LGBT personnel Equality in anything. Therefore, Equality cannot be achieved thru the voting booth, it must be accomplished by State Legislatures, the US Congress, and our Court System. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) must be repealed by Congress or found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court before the Federal Government can legally recognize marriage equality for LGBT folks. Once DOMA is out of the way, then marriage equality can be achieved nationwide. This message has been edited. Last edited by: JimCrackCorn, Mon 11 May 2009 10:15 PM",

Can you clarify how that would happen? Do you think that once the option becomes available many would be heterosexuals wanting to get married will decided to marry someone of the same sex? I'll try to clarify. By definition, gay 'marriage' is....non-traditional. If gay 'marriage' becomes legal in all 50 states, it could encourage almost ANY non-traditional form of 'marriage,' including polygamy and incestuous relationships because....when laws are changed to accomodate one small minority, other small minorities would be able to claim prejudice against THEM. And, you wouldn't suggest that THEIR 'rights' be denied, would ya? So, soon we'd have to recognize that....traditional marriage had become a concept that no longer had meaning. Under the presumption that special rights were granted to members same-sex 'marriages' over single people, it might well be accurate to predict that some single folks WOULD in fact marry in order to benefit from the advantages of marriage. It was for THIS reason that I suggested such advantages simply be removed, and that the BEST way of doing so would be revising our income tax system. Without the current system, many gays might well disregard gay 'marriage.'",

My opinion is we need several more States to step forward and legalize same-sex marriage before Congress and/or the Supreme Court will be willing to take a serious look at DOMA.",

Incest has it's own ramifications in that the offspring of such a coupling stands a greater chance of genetic damage with mental and physical disabilities. An incestuous romance between two consenting adults is rare, most often incest is brought about by force as in a Father raping a daughter. Two drunk kissing cousins may have a go at it, but it's very doubtful they would consider marriage after they sober up. Playing to close to the family tree breaks down the DNA. The laws prohibiting incest are appropriate considering what damage may be brought about to the children of such a coupling. Excuse me, but....do I read you correctly? Are you trying to say that gay 'marriage' is OK, but you'd deny other forms of non-traditional 'marriage' to OTHER minority groups? Isn't that a bit....narrowminded?",
