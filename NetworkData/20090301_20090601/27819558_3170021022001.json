Will Recognize Your Marriage The Washington, D.C., city council voted unanimously on Tuesday to recognize same-sex marriages conducted in the growing number of states where marriage equality is now legal.

He added, \"I hope this city recognizes this is a human rights struggle.\" >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid77888.asp Thank you D.C. and welcome to the growing numbers.",
