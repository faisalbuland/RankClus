        "content": "[DO NOT POST THIS IMAGE AGAIN, ANY COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE SENT TO THE LEAD MODERATOR OF THESE FORUMS...THAT WOULD BE ME. From a simple observational point of view, our Nation in the earliest days of the new Obama era faces significant threats. First and foremost, I believe, that this arrogant, narcissistic SOB! has an Agenda, and That is the dismanteling of our Democratic Republic!! and he's not alone.. Our Constitution is in crisis, Congress is in breach of their oath, ...and they are not fit to hold public office. If we don't stop this \"Userper & Cheat\" real issues won't matter at all. We won't have an economy to worry about. We won't have equal rights for all. We won't have our cherished freedom. And we will live under Sharia Law. Obama Threatens Our Survival - Facing severe terrorist and economic threats, Obama\u2019s record of being wrong on both, his corruption, his inexperience and his inability to put anyone but himself first-- poses a grave and severe threat to America and the world. Were in Deep **** my friend's.. We,(America) are getting weaker and our Enemys are Gaining on us!! The Wolfs are at the Gate!..and They smell Blood!.. The premiers of Russia and China slammed the U.S. economic system in speeches Wednesday, holding it responsible for the global economic crisis. Both focused on the role of the U.S. dollar, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao calling for better regulation of major reserve currencies and Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling over-reliance on the dollar \"dangerous.\" .. Obama Said: \"I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems.\" This objective dovetails perfectly with Congressman Barney Frank's recent assertion that the U.S. military budget should be slashed by 25 percent. It also dovetails perfectly with very real, clearly enunciated threats from increasingly belligerent nations such as Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea, and Russia. Rarely has a weaker, more pathetic spin been proffered by any (POTUS) Is Iran a Threat, or Not? Obama and the Democrats are putting our Country at RISK..!! I have already been told that the approved FY'09 Defense budget is expected to have a 3% reduction sometime early in 2009. Further, I am told that the Defense Appropriations Committee goals are to reduce \"plus-ups\" to 2006 levels, but that there is a White House desire to get that down to 1998 levels. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday warned that the defense funding \"spigot\" is closing in the face of a national economic crisis and an acute problem with the Pentagon's weapons-buying practices. \"With two major campaigns ongoing, the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on this department,\" Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee in his first hearing as President Obama's Pentagon chief. One of the programs at risk is the Future Combat Systems program . Another program that could also fall prey to these reductions is what is often referred to as the \"Future Warfighter\" program.

        "reply": "[DO NOT POST THIS IMAGE AGAIN, ANY COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE SENT TO THE LEAD MODERATOR OF THESE FORUMS...THAT WOULD BE ME. From a simple observational point of view, our Nation in the earliest days of the new Obama era faces significant threats. First and foremost, I believe, that this arrogant, narcissistic SOB! has an Agenda, and That is the dismanteling of our Democratic Republic!! and he's not alone.. Our Constitution is in crisis, Congress is in breach of their oath, ...and they are not fit to hold public office. If we don't stop this \"Userper & Cheat\" real issues won't matter at all. We won't have an economy to worry about. We won't have equal rights for all. We won't have our cherished freedom. And we will live under Sharia Law. Obama Threatens Our Survival - Facing severe terrorist and economic threats, Obama\u2019s record of being wrong on both, his corruption, his inexperience and his inability to put anyone but himself first-- poses a grave and severe threat to America and the world. Were in Deep **** my friend's.. We,(America) are getting weaker and our Enemys are Gaining on us!! The Wolfs are at the Gate!..and They smell Blood!.. The premiers of Russia and China slammed the U.S. economic system in speeches Wednesday, holding it responsible for the global economic crisis. Both focused on the role of the U.S. dollar, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao calling for better regulation of major reserve currencies and Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling over-reliance on the dollar \"dangerous.\" .. Obama Said: \"I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems.\" This objective dovetails perfectly with Congressman Barney Frank's recent assertion that the U.S. military budget should be slashed by 25 percent. It also dovetails perfectly with very real, clearly enunciated threats from increasingly belligerent nations such as Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea, and Russia. Rarely has a weaker, more pathetic spin been proffered by any (POTUS) Is Iran a Threat, or Not? Obama and the Democrats are putting our Country at RISK..!! I have already been told that the approved FY'09 Defense budget is expected to have a 3% reduction sometime early in 2009. Further, I am told that the Defense Appropriations Committee goals are to reduce \"plus-ups\" to 2006 levels, but that there is a White House desire to get that down to 1998 levels. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday warned that the defense funding \"spigot\" is closing in the face of a national economic crisis and an acute problem with the Pentagon's weapons-buying practices. \"With two major campaigns ongoing, the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on this department,\" Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee in his first hearing as President Obama's Pentagon chief. One of the programs at risk is the Future Combat Systems program . Another program that could also fall prey to these reductions is what is often referred to as the \"Future Warfighter\" program. When the time comes, and it will come, that we need to re-gear up to fight another fight, whether it's a time when we need modernized and combat ready equipment, or Future Warfighter vehicles etc. Jumping topics a slight bit, if the US auto industry compresses, or we lose heavy equipment manufacturing capability etc. We lose.

An administration that is willing to take bold action to address it (IMHO not bold enough), but certainly an improvement over the last 8 years. I see what appears to be a significant change in economic policy to include oversight and perhaps re-regulation of financial markets (something long overdue and IMHO the basic cause of our economic woes).

Thursday, March 05, 2009 Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Thursday shows that 41% of the nation\u2019s voters now Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as President. Twenty-seven percent (27%) Strongly Disapprove to give Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of +14 (see trends). Thirty-five percent (35%) of voters now say the nation is heading in the right direction. That\u2019s up from 30% a week ago and 28% the week before. Seventy-two percent (72%) of Democrats Strongly Approve of the President\u2019s performance while 52% of Republicans Strongly Disapprove. Voters not affiliated with either major party are fairly evenly divided (see other recent demographic highlights). The Presidential Approval Index is calculated by subtracting the number who Strongly Disapprove from the number who Strongly Approve. It is updated daily at 9:30 a.m. Eastern (sign up for free daily e-mail update). Updates also available on Twitter. Please take a moment to predict where the President\u2019s Approval Index ratings will be at the end of his first 100 days in office. Overall, 59% of voters say they at least somewhat approve of the President\u2019s performance so far while 40% disapprove. For more measures, see Obama By the Numbers. As you can see they take the approval and subtract out the disapproval to get their number. So you are correct in saying that it may be a 68% approval, but once you subtract out the disapproval...it ain't so good. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

        "content": "[DO NOT POST THIS IMAGE AGAIN, ANY COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE SENT TO THE LEAD MODERATOR OF THESE FORUMS...THAT WOULD BE ME. From a simple observational point of view, our Nation in the earliest days of the new Obama era faces significant threats. First and foremost, I believe, that this arrogant, narcissistic SOB! has an Agenda, and That is the dismanteling of our Democratic Republic!! and he's not alone.. Our Constitution is in crisis, Congress is in breach of their oath, ...and they are not fit to hold public office. If we don't stop this \"Userper & Cheat\" real issues won't matter at all. We won't have an economy to worry about. We won't have equal rights for all. We won't have our cherished freedom. And we will live under Sharia Law. Obama Threatens Our Survival - Facing severe terrorist and economic threats, Obama\u2019s record of being wrong on both, his corruption, his inexperience and his inability to put anyone but himself first-- poses a grave and severe threat to America and the world. Were in Deep **** my friend's.. We,(America) are getting weaker and our Enemys are Gaining on us!! The Wolfs are at the Gate!..and They smell Blood!.. The premiers of Russia and China slammed the U.S. economic system in speeches Wednesday, holding it responsible for the global economic crisis. Both focused on the role of the U.S. dollar, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao calling for better regulation of major reserve currencies and Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling over-reliance on the dollar \"dangerous.\" .. Obama Said: \"I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems.\" This objective dovetails perfectly with Congressman Barney Frank's recent assertion that the U.S. military budget should be slashed by 25 percent. It also dovetails perfectly with very real, clearly enunciated threats from increasingly belligerent nations such as Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea, and Russia. Rarely has a weaker, more pathetic spin been proffered by any (POTUS) Is Iran a Threat, or Not? Obama and the Democrats are putting our Country at RISK..!! I have already been told that the approved FY'09 Defense budget is expected to have a 3% reduction sometime early in 2009. Further, I am told that the Defense Appropriations Committee goals are to reduce \"plus-ups\" to 2006 levels, but that there is a White House desire to get that down to 1998 levels. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday warned that the defense funding \"spigot\" is closing in the face of a national economic crisis and an acute problem with the Pentagon's weapons-buying practices. \"With two major campaigns ongoing, the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on this department,\" Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee in his first hearing as President Obama's Pentagon chief. One of the programs at risk is the Future Combat Systems program . Another program that could also fall prey to these reductions is what is often referred to as the \"Future Warfighter\" program.

        "reply": "[DO NOT POST THIS IMAGE AGAIN, ANY COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE SENT TO THE LEAD MODERATOR OF THESE FORUMS...THAT WOULD BE ME. From a simple observational point of view, our Nation in the earliest days of the new Obama era faces significant threats. First and foremost, I believe, that this arrogant, narcissistic SOB! has an Agenda, and That is the dismanteling of our Democratic Republic!! and he's not alone.. Our Constitution is in crisis, Congress is in breach of their oath, ...and they are not fit to hold public office. If we don't stop this \"Userper & Cheat\" real issues won't matter at all. We won't have an economy to worry about. We won't have equal rights for all. We won't have our cherished freedom. And we will live under Sharia Law. Obama Threatens Our Survival - Facing severe terrorist and economic threats, Obama\u2019s record of being wrong on both, his corruption, his inexperience and his inability to put anyone but himself first-- poses a grave and severe threat to America and the world. Were in Deep **** my friend's.. We,(America) are getting weaker and our Enemys are Gaining on us!! The Wolfs are at the Gate!..and They smell Blood!.. The premiers of Russia and China slammed the U.S. economic system in speeches Wednesday, holding it responsible for the global economic crisis. Both focused on the role of the U.S. dollar, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao calling for better regulation of major reserve currencies and Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling over-reliance on the dollar \"dangerous.\" .. Obama Said: \"I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems.\" This objective dovetails perfectly with Congressman Barney Frank's recent assertion that the U.S. military budget should be slashed by 25 percent. It also dovetails perfectly with very real, clearly enunciated threats from increasingly belligerent nations such as Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea, and Russia. Rarely has a weaker, more pathetic spin been proffered by any (POTUS) Is Iran a Threat, or Not? Obama and the Democrats are putting our Country at RISK..!! I have already been told that the approved FY'09 Defense budget is expected to have a 3% reduction sometime early in 2009. Further, I am told that the Defense Appropriations Committee goals are to reduce \"plus-ups\" to 2006 levels, but that there is a White House desire to get that down to 1998 levels. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday warned that the defense funding \"spigot\" is closing in the face of a national economic crisis and an acute problem with the Pentagon's weapons-buying practices. \"With two major campaigns ongoing, the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on this department,\" Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee in his first hearing as President Obama's Pentagon chief. One of the programs at risk is the Future Combat Systems program . Another program that could also fall prey to these reductions is what is often referred to as the \"Future Warfighter\" program. When the time comes, and it will come, that we need to re-gear up to fight another fight, whether it's a time when we need modernized and combat ready equipment, or Future Warfighter vehicles etc. Jumping topics a slight bit, if the US auto industry compresses, or we lose heavy equipment manufacturing capability etc. We lose.

An administration that is willing to take bold action to address it (IMHO not bold enough), but certainly an improvement over the last 8 years. I see what appears to be a significant change in economic policy to include oversight and perhaps re-regulation of financial markets (something long overdue and IMHO the basic cause of our economic woes).

Thursday, March 05, 2009 Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Thursday shows that 41% of the nation\u2019s voters now Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as President. Twenty-seven percent (27%) Strongly Disapprove to give Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of +14 (see trends). Thirty-five percent (35%) of voters now say the nation is heading in the right direction. That\u2019s up from 30% a week ago and 28% the week before. Seventy-two percent (72%) of Democrats Strongly Approve of the President\u2019s performance while 52% of Republicans Strongly Disapprove. Voters not affiliated with either major party are fairly evenly divided (see other recent demographic highlights). The Presidential Approval Index is calculated by subtracting the number who Strongly Disapprove from the number who Strongly Approve. It is updated daily at 9:30 a.m. Eastern (sign up for free daily e-mail update). Updates also available on Twitter. Please take a moment to predict where the President\u2019s Approval Index ratings will be at the end of his first 100 days in office. Overall, 59% of voters say they at least somewhat approve of the President\u2019s performance so far while 40% disapprove. For more measures, see Obama By the Numbers. As you can see they take the approval and subtract out the disapproval to get their number. So you are correct in saying that it may be a 68% approval, but once you subtract out the disapproval...it ain't so good. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

        "content": "[DO NOT POST THIS IMAGE AGAIN, ANY COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE SENT TO THE LEAD MODERATOR OF THESE FORUMS...THAT WOULD BE ME. From a simple observational point of view, our Nation in the earliest days of the new Obama era faces significant threats. First and foremost, I believe, that this arrogant, narcissistic SOB! has an Agenda, and That is the dismanteling of our Democratic Republic!! and he's not alone.. Our Constitution is in crisis, Congress is in breach of their oath, ...and they are not fit to hold public office. If we don't stop this \"Userper & Cheat\" real issues won't matter at all. We won't have an economy to worry about. We won't have equal rights for all. We won't have our cherished freedom. And we will live under Sharia Law. Obama Threatens Our Survival - Facing severe terrorist and economic threats, Obama\u2019s record of being wrong on both, his corruption, his inexperience and his inability to put anyone but himself first-- poses a grave and severe threat to America and the world. Were in Deep **** my friend's.. We,(America) are getting weaker and our Enemys are Gaining on us!! The Wolfs are at the Gate!..and They smell Blood!.. The premiers of Russia and China slammed the U.S. economic system in speeches Wednesday, holding it responsible for the global economic crisis. Both focused on the role of the U.S. dollar, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao calling for better regulation of major reserve currencies and Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling over-reliance on the dollar \"dangerous.\" .. Obama Said: \"I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems.\" This objective dovetails perfectly with Congressman Barney Frank's recent assertion that the U.S. military budget should be slashed by 25 percent. It also dovetails perfectly with very real, clearly enunciated threats from increasingly belligerent nations such as Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea, and Russia. Rarely has a weaker, more pathetic spin been proffered by any (POTUS) Is Iran a Threat, or Not? Obama and the Democrats are putting our Country at RISK..!! I have already been told that the approved FY'09 Defense budget is expected to have a 3% reduction sometime early in 2009. Further, I am told that the Defense Appropriations Committee goals are to reduce \"plus-ups\" to 2006 levels, but that there is a White House desire to get that down to 1998 levels. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday warned that the defense funding \"spigot\" is closing in the face of a national economic crisis and an acute problem with the Pentagon's weapons-buying practices. \"With two major campaigns ongoing, the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on this department,\" Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee in his first hearing as President Obama's Pentagon chief. One of the programs at risk is the Future Combat Systems program . Another program that could also fall prey to these reductions is what is often referred to as the \"Future Warfighter\" program.

        "reply": "[DO NOT POST THIS IMAGE AGAIN, ANY COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE SENT TO THE LEAD MODERATOR OF THESE FORUMS...THAT WOULD BE ME. From a simple observational point of view, our Nation in the earliest days of the new Obama era faces significant threats. First and foremost, I believe, that this arrogant, narcissistic SOB! has an Agenda, and That is the dismanteling of our Democratic Republic!! and he's not alone.. Our Constitution is in crisis, Congress is in breach of their oath, ...and they are not fit to hold public office. If we don't stop this \"Userper & Cheat\" real issues won't matter at all. We won't have an economy to worry about. We won't have equal rights for all. We won't have our cherished freedom. And we will live under Sharia Law. Obama Threatens Our Survival - Facing severe terrorist and economic threats, Obama\u2019s record of being wrong on both, his corruption, his inexperience and his inability to put anyone but himself first-- poses a grave and severe threat to America and the world. Were in Deep **** my friend's.. We,(America) are getting weaker and our Enemys are Gaining on us!! The Wolfs are at the Gate!..and They smell Blood!.. The premiers of Russia and China slammed the U.S. economic system in speeches Wednesday, holding it responsible for the global economic crisis. Both focused on the role of the U.S. dollar, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao calling for better regulation of major reserve currencies and Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling over-reliance on the dollar \"dangerous.\" .. Obama Said: \"I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems.\" This objective dovetails perfectly with Congressman Barney Frank's recent assertion that the U.S. military budget should be slashed by 25 percent. It also dovetails perfectly with very real, clearly enunciated threats from increasingly belligerent nations such as Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea, and Russia. Rarely has a weaker, more pathetic spin been proffered by any (POTUS) Is Iran a Threat, or Not? Obama and the Democrats are putting our Country at RISK..!! I have already been told that the approved FY'09 Defense budget is expected to have a 3% reduction sometime early in 2009. Further, I am told that the Defense Appropriations Committee goals are to reduce \"plus-ups\" to 2006 levels, but that there is a White House desire to get that down to 1998 levels. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday warned that the defense funding \"spigot\" is closing in the face of a national economic crisis and an acute problem with the Pentagon's weapons-buying practices. \"With two major campaigns ongoing, the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on this department,\" Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee in his first hearing as President Obama's Pentagon chief. One of the programs at risk is the Future Combat Systems program . Another program that could also fall prey to these reductions is what is often referred to as the \"Future Warfighter\" program. When the time comes, and it will come, that we need to re-gear up to fight another fight, whether it's a time when we need modernized and combat ready equipment, or Future Warfighter vehicles etc. Jumping topics a slight bit, if the US auto industry compresses, or we lose heavy equipment manufacturing capability etc. We lose.

Oh let's see, when have tax cuts not worked...how about for the last 8 years! OK, they worked well for the top 2% of the population but it's sucked for the rest of us. As to you're comment regarding Obama crashing the economy...do you really think ANYONE will take you seriously? ROFLMAO!!! ROFLMAO all you want, but can you HONESTLY say that your happy with what your seeing going on with this \"adminstration\"? Happy is a relative term; compared to what? There are NO politicians I completely trust. What I have seen so far is an administration that seems to recognize and admit there is a problem. An administration that is willing to take bold action to address it (IMHO not bold enough), but certainly an improvement over the last 8 years. I see what appears to be a significant change in economic policy to include oversight and perhaps re-regulation of financial markets (something long overdue and IMHO the basic cause of our economic woes). So to answer your question \u201cam I happy\u201d, no but I am hopeful.",

Obama's already high approval rating went up a bit to 68% during his 6 weeks in office, according to the bipartisan NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday(3/3/09). Thursday, March 05, 2009 Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Thursday shows that 41% of the nation\u2019s voters now Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as President. Twenty-seven percent (27%) Strongly Disapprove to give Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of +14 (see trends). Thirty-five percent (35%) of voters now say the nation is heading in the right direction. That\u2019s up from 30% a week ago and 28% the week before. Seventy-two percent (72%) of Democrats Strongly Approve of the President\u2019s performance while 52% of Republicans Strongly Disapprove. Voters not affiliated with either major party are fairly evenly divided (see other recent demographic highlights). The Presidential Approval Index is calculated by subtracting the number who Strongly Disapprove from the number who Strongly Approve. It is updated daily at 9:30 a.m. Eastern (sign up for free daily e-mail update). Updates also available on Twitter. Please take a moment to predict where the President\u2019s Approval Index ratings will be at the end of his first 100 days in office. Overall, 59% of voters say they at least somewhat approve of the President\u2019s performance so far while 40% disapprove. For more measures, see Obama By the Numbers. As you can see they take the approval and subtract out the disapproval to get their number. So you are correct in saying that it may be a 68% approval, but once you subtract out the disapproval...it ain't so good. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
