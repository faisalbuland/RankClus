        "content": "this letter was sent a month ago. No responses were received, and the Va TOOK Sixto;s BENEFITS AWAY today, after the va granted him an appeal..Tito never committed a crime, but was a suspect. He never knew of the warrant as he was out of state the VA is leaving him with out support becasue he was a suspect 14 years ago! tehy also want him to pay back all his disability! If they can take his disability, I say, give him back his mind, hands and legs! What can he do? How to have an uproar over the Va 's miscarriage of the interpretation of the laws! The goverment is just finding ways to finance the stimulus package! A public law was inacted, but the interpretation is toally out of wack with the intent! Sixto Cruz is a 100% totally and permanently disabled veteran. He has chronic, severe PTSD. In addition, he has had both of his legs and 7 of his ten fingers amputated. He has been receiving a Veterans compensation for his military service related disability as a result of the Vietnam War. In 1994, a misdemeanor warrant was issued in Bronx County of the State of New York for Mr. Cruz. Over the course of many years, as the warrant went unanswered, the misdemeanor was then converted to a felony warrant. To make a long, complicated story short, the original warrant was vacated and dismissed by Judge Adler, Superior Court, County of Bronx, NY on 03/02/2007. My husband was never tried or convicted of any crime pursuant to this warrant. He was not required to serve any jail time associated with the charges. He has been completely adjudicated and the charges have been vacated. The main problem we have now is VA interpretation of current law, specifically Public Law 103-107, which addresses \"fugitive felons,\" and outlines suspension of VA benefits. It is the contention of the Veteran's Administration that my husband should make restitution for benefits he received from the VA during the time of the outstanding warrant, namely in the amount of $146,233.33. The VA has tentative plans to take his VA compensation in April 1, 2009 as repayment of this alleged debt. How is that Mr. Cruz committed no crime, yet he is in debt to the U.S. government for $146, 233.33, and will lose his disability compensation for a warrant that was vacated? Anyone can be arrested in this country for anything, but as I recall a man is innocent until proven guilty. Needless to say, guilt or innocence is not even in question in this situation. It is a misinterpretation of the terms addressed in Public Law 103-107 that has caused the unresolved controversy. Mr. Cruz was never tried or convicted of a crime; however, the way the law is written he is being penalized and held accountable for a debt for having an outstanding warrant, and for being a \"suspect,\" not for being a convicted \"felon.\" I believe if we can distinctly clarify the definition of the terms referenced, we can quickly reach fruition of this misunderstanding. Clarity of understanding comes in defining the discernable differences in terms, \"suspect\" and \"felon.\" These are the terms I truly believe are misconstrued by the Veteran's Administration appeals board in application of Public Law 103-107. My husband having been adjudicated of the charges was never tried and never convicted. To that end, the worst he ever could have been was a \"fugitive suspect.\" He was never a \"fugitive felon,\" in as much as by the definition of Public Law he was not a felon, nor was he, \"convicted of a felony.\" I have submitted supporting documentation to support my contention, along with the portion of Public Law 103-107 in question also for your review. In summary, I submit to you that the English definition of felon is \"one who has committed a felony.\" Until someone has been convicted of a crime they are merely a \"suspect,\" of a crime and not a \"felon.\" A felon has been tried and convicted, while a suspect is charged with the suspicion of crime but has not been convicted. Today, I do not understand how a simple misunderstanding of one word can abandon a man who gave his health, his legs/fingers and well being for the service of his country as a soldier, now unable to work. How can we make him responsible for repayment of $146, 233.33, for a nonexistent crime? Notably, there is also a discernable difference in the terms, compensation and pension. A pension is a healthy man's reward for years of service, whereas, a compensation is a benefit to compensate that worker for a loss that cannot be recovered. The money that my husband receives from the VA is not a pension, but is instead a compensation to compensate him for his wartime injuries. He is not magically able to go to work, or mysteriously cured now. He is still missing his legs, his fingers and his peace of mind. The Veteran's Administration set his disability precedence when they ruled he was 100% disabled and unable to work based on his military service. To take away his disability compensation now would leave him homeless, unable to provide the basic needs for himself of food, shelter and clothing. At a bare minimum, morally and contractually the United States Government owes this man the basics of life, specifically food, shelter and clothing since the Veteran's Administration admittedly granted disability compensation for his military service. In all honesty, if the U.S. government or the VA would be so kind as to reinstate my husband's legs, his fingers and his mental stability, he would gladly work and return his disability compensation. He is not lazy. He is disabled. He is proud and would work if he was able to, but his legs are gone. His fingers are gone, and he just cannot work to provide for himself. How can the United States government take away the compensation they promised him for a lifetime of disability, for a crime he did not commit? It seems incomprehensible, but I assure you that is exactly what is happening. Having exhausted the appeals process it has been suggested that we return to the judge who vacated the warrant and ask for a revision of the dismissal date, back dating it to the day it was issued. We are very short on time with the impending action coming on April 1, 2009 to cease his compensation payments. I am writing to you to ask your help in expunging this adjudicated warrant from his criminal record to avoid further difficulties My husband needs your help. He is not a bad man, just a handicapped man. Here is a man who cannot work or support himself. His disability was a direct result of his service defending our liberty and freedom. . Since the warrant was vacated, I ask you, \"Was there a crime?\" If the same agency issuing the warrant vacated the warrant, truly, was there a crime? How can we hold a man liable for a debt contingent on a nonexistent crime? Anyone can be arrested for anything, but that does not make the issuance of a warrant a default verdict of guilty. As I recall, in this country a man is innocent until he is proven guilty. Since there was no custodial offense, the validity of the warrant comes into question; a warrant, which has been vacated and adjudicated. Mr. Cruz did not flee to avoid prosecution 'after conviction,\" because again, he was not convicted. He did not flee to avoid custody or confinement 'after conviction,' as specified in the Public Law, because again, there was no custodial offense. If he had been found guilty and was incarcerated in a government subsidized facility, such as being held in a prison, mental hospital or hospitalized in a Veteran's hospital where the government provided for him that would make for completely different set of circumstances. That is not the case at all. I pray that you will be able to intervene and hope for a swift resolution. Thank you for your assistance.

        "content": "this letter was sent a month ago. No responses were received, and the Va TOOK Sixto;s BENEFITS AWAY today, after the va granted him an appeal..Tito never committed a crime, but was a suspect. He never knew of the warrant as he was out of state the VA is leaving him with out support becasue he was a suspect 14 years ago! tehy also want him to pay back all his disability! If they can take his disability, I say, give him back his mind, hands and legs! What can he do? How to have an uproar over the Va 's miscarriage of the interpretation of the laws! The goverment is just finding ways to finance the stimulus package! A public law was inacted, but the interpretation is toally out of wack with the intent! Sixto Cruz is a 100% totally and permanently disabled veteran. He has chronic, severe PTSD. In addition, he has had both of his legs and 7 of his ten fingers amputated. He has been receiving a Veterans compensation for his military service related disability as a result of the Vietnam War. In 1994, a misdemeanor warrant was issued in Bronx County of the State of New York for Mr. Cruz. Over the course of many years, as the warrant went unanswered, the misdemeanor was then converted to a felony warrant. To make a long, complicated story short, the original warrant was vacated and dismissed by Judge Adler, Superior Court, County of Bronx, NY on 03/02/2007. My husband was never tried or convicted of any crime pursuant to this warrant. He was not required to serve any jail time associated with the charges. He has been completely adjudicated and the charges have been vacated. The main problem we have now is VA interpretation of current law, specifically Public Law 103-107, which addresses \"fugitive felons,\" and outlines suspension of VA benefits. It is the contention of the Veteran's Administration that my husband should make restitution for benefits he received from the VA during the time of the outstanding warrant, namely in the amount of $146,233.33. The VA has tentative plans to take his VA compensation in April 1, 2009 as repayment of this alleged debt. How is that Mr. Cruz committed no crime, yet he is in debt to the U.S. government for $146, 233.33, and will lose his disability compensation for a warrant that was vacated? Anyone can be arrested in this country for anything, but as I recall a man is innocent until proven guilty. Needless to say, guilt or innocence is not even in question in this situation. It is a misinterpretation of the terms addressed in Public Law 103-107 that has caused the unresolved controversy. Mr. Cruz was never tried or convicted of a crime; however, the way the law is written he is being penalized and held accountable for a debt for having an outstanding warrant, and for being a \"suspect,\" not for being a convicted \"felon.\" I believe if we can distinctly clarify the definition of the terms referenced, we can quickly reach fruition of this misunderstanding. Clarity of understanding comes in defining the discernable differences in terms, \"suspect\" and \"felon.\" These are the terms I truly believe are misconstrued by the Veteran's Administration appeals board in application of Public Law 103-107. My husband having been adjudicated of the charges was never tried and never convicted. To that end, the worst he ever could have been was a \"fugitive suspect.\" He was never a \"fugitive felon,\" in as much as by the definition of Public Law he was not a felon, nor was he, \"convicted of a felony.\" I have submitted supporting documentation to support my contention, along with the portion of Public Law 103-107 in question also for your review. In summary, I submit to you that the English definition of felon is \"one who has committed a felony.\" Until someone has been convicted of a crime they are merely a \"suspect,\" of a crime and not a \"felon.\" A felon has been tried and convicted, while a suspect is charged with the suspicion of crime but has not been convicted. Today, I do not understand how a simple misunderstanding of one word can abandon a man who gave his health, his legs/fingers and well being for the service of his country as a soldier, now unable to work. How can we make him responsible for repayment of $146, 233.33, for a nonexistent crime? Notably, there is also a discernable difference in the terms, compensation and pension. A pension is a healthy man's reward for years of service, whereas, a compensation is a benefit to compensate that worker for a loss that cannot be recovered. The money that my husband receives from the VA is not a pension, but is instead a compensation to compensate him for his wartime injuries. He is not magically able to go to work, or mysteriously cured now. He is still missing his legs, his fingers and his peace of mind. The Veteran's Administration set his disability precedence when they ruled he was 100% disabled and unable to work based on his military service. To take away his disability compensation now would leave him homeless, unable to provide the basic needs for himself of food, shelter and clothing. At a bare minimum, morally and contractually the United States Government owes this man the basics of life, specifically food, shelter and clothing since the Veteran's Administration admittedly granted disability compensation for his military service. In all honesty, if the U.S. government or the VA would be so kind as to reinstate my husband's legs, his fingers and his mental stability, he would gladly work and return his disability compensation. He is not lazy. He is disabled. He is proud and would work if he was able to, but his legs are gone. His fingers are gone, and he just cannot work to provide for himself. How can the United States government take away the compensation they promised him for a lifetime of disability, for a crime he did not commit? It seems incomprehensible, but I assure you that is exactly what is happening. Having exhausted the appeals process it has been suggested that we return to the judge who vacated the warrant and ask for a revision of the dismissal date, back dating it to the day it was issued. We are very short on time with the impending action coming on April 1, 2009 to cease his compensation payments. I am writing to you to ask your help in expunging this adjudicated warrant from his criminal record to avoid further difficulties My husband needs your help. He is not a bad man, just a handicapped man. Here is a man who cannot work or support himself. His disability was a direct result of his service defending our liberty and freedom. . Since the warrant was vacated, I ask you, \"Was there a crime?\" If the same agency issuing the warrant vacated the warrant, truly, was there a crime? How can we hold a man liable for a debt contingent on a nonexistent crime? Anyone can be arrested for anything, but that does not make the issuance of a warrant a default verdict of guilty. As I recall, in this country a man is innocent until he is proven guilty. Since there was no custodial offense, the validity of the warrant comes into question; a warrant, which has been vacated and adjudicated. Mr. Cruz did not flee to avoid prosecution 'after conviction,\" because again, he was not convicted. He did not flee to avoid custody or confinement 'after conviction,' as specified in the Public Law, because again, there was no custodial offense. If he had been found guilty and was incarcerated in a government subsidized facility, such as being held in a prison, mental hospital or hospitalized in a Veteran's hospital where the government provided for him that would make for completely different set of circumstances. That is not the case at all. I pray that you will be able to intervene and hope for a swift resolution. Thank you for your assistance.
