The Iranian-American journalist, Roxana Saberi, has been sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of spying for Washington, her lawyer reported Saturday. The other detainee is Hossein Derakhshan, a blogger who has been jailed since November without any official charges. Mr. Ahmadinejad, who will be attending an international conference on racism on Monday and is expected to seek re-election in June, may be seeking to cast himself as a defender of human rights, analysts said. He may also be trying to prevent radical forces from sabotaging a possible reconciliation between Iran and the United States. President Obama, speaking at a news conference in Trinidad on Sunday, said he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about Ms. Saberi\u2019s safety and called for her release. \u201cShe is an American citizen, and I have complete confidence that she was not engaging in any sort of espionage,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that the United States would ask Iran for \u201ca proper disposition of this case.\u201d Meanwhile, Ms. Saberi\u2019s father said in an interview on Sunday that neither she nor her lawyer had been given any notice of her trial last week, which he said lasted less than an hour. In Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s letter, he urged Tehran\u2019s prosecutor general, Saeed Mortazavi, to examine the cases fairly, the official IRNA news agency reported. Although the court\u2019s workings are secret, Mr. Mortazavi, known as a hard-line conservative, would be the one to at least oversee the prosecution of both cases. (....) Analysts here suggested the letter\u2019s intent may have been to stake out a political position before the June 12 election, where he would face liberal opposition and may want to inoculate himself against criticism on the human rights front. One analyst, Alireza Rajaee, said that he might be looking past the election to a possible bid to improve relations with the United States. In a conciliatory speech last week, responding to overtures by Mr. Obama, he said that Iran would welcome change by the United States. \u201cHe wants to present himself as a man eligible for international talks and also dialogue with the United States,\u201d Mr. Rajaee said. \u201cHe is confident that he will win another term and wants to send a positive signal inside the country and to make sure that talks with Washington will proceed.\u201d (....) Hopefully this game of kicking the ball back and forth will end with her release! +http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/middleeast/20iran.html?ref=middleeast \"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\" -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
