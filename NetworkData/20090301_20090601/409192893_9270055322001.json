There has, for example, been more short-term success in research into adult stem cells but that's mainly because they aren't trying anything big or complex with them as yet - it's unlikely that we'll be able to grow a kidney, to use your example, from adult cells for quite a while because that doesn't seem to be the way they work but there has been quite a bit of success in things like bone marrow, glands (IIRC reading a piece on insulin production) and maybe liver cells (the liver might be big but most of the cells are the same. Foetal cells on the other hand have far more potential in theory because they can become anything and for pure research purposes it makes much more sense to start with them because you can watch the whole process, rather than coming in later as you would with adult cells. Placental and umbilical cells are almost a different story again and they probably have more therapeutic (rather than research) potential than those from foetuses. If one stores them at an individual's birth it may be more desirable use them later because they are of that individual and therefore not likely to cause rejection and therefore a organ replacement would not necessitate a lifetime of anti-rejection drugs which have a negative effect on the immune system.",
