There have now been over 200 found. Let's guess, about 3,500 per site,(that's how many they thought they found in the one near Al Hillah) times 200. That's 700,000 bodies, many women & children.

Might it be more accurate to say that....America's legacy will be that we ended Saddam's legacy? All that's required for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.",
