ReduceT sez: \"Thus, as far as I know, no where in the US is blasphemy a crime. \"Victimless\" is problematic as that usually involves a consensual act between two or more adults and the god-idea is neither human nor adult.

You can't arrest, prosecute or punish anyone for blasphemy in this modern secular society. It's a disturbing idea or even mental illness of sorts to believe the act of blasphemy will get you punished by unseen uncollaborated forces. It's a phobia of sort related to Zeusophobia- Fear of God or gods.

Remember, there is no God to do anything about what anybody does about anything, but that does not stop people from believing they do things because god told them to. Does God tell you to post on here? Maybe not God... Yes, that's an amusing take on his activity! However, not even that character concocted in the heads of humans exists. There is no one else to blame by ones self. We can draw from our psyche that which justifies our dysfunction. The whole 'god/devils' theory is a simple (yet complex) mental gymnastic to explain cause and effect, the past and the future. It enables some people to cope with existence, how the unseen world might affect you and how you might have some influence over it. But, in reality, it's all make believe. Believing simply doesn't make it real, but then humans can believe anything.... WMD's = worship of mass deception.",

Decides that in order to make the necessary determination whether or not for the purposes of paragraph 3 (c) and paragraph 4 of resolution 661 (1990) humanitarian circumstances have arisen, the Committee shall keep the situation regarding foodstuffs in Iraq and Kuwait under constant review; 2. Expects Iraq to comply with its obligations under Security Council resolution 664 (1990) in respect of third State nationals and reaffirms that Iraq remains fully responsible for their safety and well-being in accordance with international humanitarian law including, where applicable, the Fourth Geneva Convention; 3. Requests, for the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this resolution, that the Secretary-General seek urgently, and on a continuing basis, information from relevant United Nations and other appropriate humanitarian agencies and all other sources on the availability of food in Iraq and Kuwait, such information to be communicated by the Secretary-General to the Committee regularly; 4. Requests further that in seeking and supplying such information particular attention will be paid to such categories of persons who might suffer specially, such as children under 15 years of age, expectant mothers, maternity cases, the sick and the elderly; 5. Decides that if the Committee, after receiving the reports from the Secretary-General, determines that circumstances have arisen in which there is an urgent humanitarian need to supply foodstuffs to Iraq or Kuwait in order to relieve human suffering, it will report promptly to the Council its decision as to how such need should be met; 6. Directs the Committee that in formulating its decisions it should bear in mind that foodstuffs should be provided through the United Nations in co-operation with the International Committee of the Red Cross or other appropriate humanitarian agencies and distributed by them or under their supervision in order to ensure that they reach the intended beneficiaries; 7. Requests the Secretary-General to use his good offices to facilitate the delivery and distribution of foodstuffs to Kuwait and Iraq in accordance with the provisions of this and other relevant resolutions; 8. Recalls that resolution 661 (1990) does not apply to supplies intended strictly for medical purposes, but in this connection recommends that medical supplies should be exported under the strict supervision of the Government of the exporting State or by appropriate humanitarian agencies.\" Wandering and Wondering",
