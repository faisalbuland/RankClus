In one case brought under the provisions of Article 88 of the UCMJ a major general was forced to retire for comments he made, Tully said. Easterling also could be charged with conduct unbecoming an officer, he said. If an officer actually believes there has been some misconduct by the president, Tully said, there are ways he could have responded. Under Article 138, he said, any person can bring an allegation of misconduct by a commander through the chain of command, \"though I don't think [it] has ever been used to allege misconduct by the president.\" ...OK? I believe the poster is upset over the posters and others who are vehemently opposed to Obama's Presidency. He appears to be particularly bothered by the fact that, since Obama has only been in office for a month, the opposition can't be based on anything he's done, but who he is. And he holds up Bush and his record (because there's an eight-year body of work available) to show misconduct by a commander.",
