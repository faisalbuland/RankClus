Weil MSNBC news commentator Keith Olbermann is taking on his Fox News counterpart Sean Hannity over the issue of waterboarding \u2013 in a rather extreme way. He blasted Hannity\u2019s views on the issue and said he would donate $1,000 to charity for every second that Hannity is waterboarded. Hannity, in an argument with actor Charles Grodin on Fox, defended waterboarding, calling it a means of \u201cenhanced interrogation.\u201d When Grodin asked Hannity if he would consent to be waterboarded himself, the Fox anchor replied, \"Sure. I'll do it for charity. I'll let you do it. I'll do it for the troops' families.\" That wasn\u2019t enough for Olbermann. \"What a breakthrough it would be if, by having reality literally forced upon him, a buffoon like Hannity were to realize the deadly seriousness of this,\" Olbermann says. \"The searing truth: that the moment of torture automatically makes the presumed bad guy recipient the victim, and makes the torturer into the evildoer.\" As for the charity offer, Olbermann says, \"For every second you last, a thousand dollars - live or on tape, provided other networks' cameras are there.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t stop there. \u201cOh, and I'll double it when you admit you feared for your life, when you admit the horrible truth - waterboarding, the symbol of the last administration, is torture,\" Olbermann says. ----------- I have not heard that Hannity has accepted. I watched Olbermann on 4/28 and didn't see it mentioned. Walt",
