The argument will be that changing the tax code to a \"flat tax\" or \"fair tax\" will effect the revenue stream in unknown ways.

Well, here is your fantasy in reality - Co-sponsonered by Orrin Hatch... quote: Obama Inks National Service Act By Carolyn Shanahan | Apr 23 2009 Flanked by members of Congress, President Obama signed a $5.7 billion national service bill into law on Tuesday. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, a collaboration effort of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), will increase government support for service, allocating $5.7 billion to service organizations from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014. It will expand AmeriCorps opportunities from 75,000 to 250,000 slots nationwide and further establish four new service groups: a Clean Energy Service Corps, an Education Corps, a Healthy Futures Corps and a Veteran Service Corps. Before signing the bill, Obama delivered remarks to an audience that included first lady Michelle Obama, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, former first lady Rosalynn Carter and various congressional representatives. In his address, Obama emphasized the importance of groups like AmeriCorps, a national program that organizes volunteers to support a variety of non-profits working in the areas of health services, park cleanup and the tutoring of underprivileged children, in effecting critical social change. \u201cPrograms like [AmeriCorps] are a force multiplier; they leverage small numbers of members into thousands of volunteers. And we will focus their service into solving today\u2019s most pressing challenges: clean energy, energy efficiency, health care, education, economic opportunity, veterans and military families,\u201d Obama said. \"http://www.thehoya.com/node/18900\" Not a chance - It's just a paranoid talking point.

But implementing pay-go doesn't mean that is what is going to happen and if it does happen it is to fund a new expenditure. Why not cut wasteful spending because it is wasteful, not because you want to spend the money elsewhere? Plus, if Congress doesn't want to take the time to find government waste, raising taxes is an acceptable solution under pay-go rules. I think a fair tax or flat tax are much better alternatives to what we have right now. But, you know that Congress as it is currently populated will never even think about either alternative. All pay-go does is give them one more excuse to keep these tax proposals on the shelf collecting dust.",
