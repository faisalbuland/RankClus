Every time the righties believe they have him (with their wedge issues), he comes and puts out their fire. Keep up the excellent work Mr. President. Nearly 40 protesters arrested at Notre Dame By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer \u2013 42 mins ago SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 Nearly 40 people were arrested Sunday as they tried to enter the University of Notre Dame to protest President Barack Obama's appearance at commencement, police said. At least 39 people were taken into custody on trespassing charges, police Sgt. Bill Redman said. Among those arrested were Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff identified as \"Roe\" in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. She now opposes abortion. Obama's commencement speech capped weeks of protests at the nation's most prominent Roman Catholic university. Critics have condemned the university's decision to invite Obama, who supports abortion rights and embryonic stem-cell research, and some have called for the resignation of the Rev. John Jenkins, the university's president. In his introduction for Obama, Jenkins reiterated the school's support for the church's teaching on the sanctity of human life but applauded Obama for coming to the school. \"Others might have avoided this venue for that reason, but President Obama is not someone who stops talking to those who differ with him,\" he said. Obama thanked graduates for their \"maturity and responsibility,\" acknowledging that his appearance \"has not been without controversy.\" Hundreds of people attended an outdoor Mass and rally on campus, while students who decided not to attend the commencement went elsewhere on campus for prayer. Students opposing the Obama invitation had urged peaceful protests. Victor Saenz, a philosophy graduate from Mexicali, Mexico, said attending the ceremony \"was something I just couldn't do\" because he believed Obama's invitation violated a 2004 statement adopted by U.S. bishops saying Catholic institutions should not honor those who don't adhere to church teachings. In his commencement appearance, Obama also received an honorary law degree. Bishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Notre Dame, joined the rally and called students \"heroes\" for expressing their anger over the invitation to Obama. Some students who attended the rally carried signs declaring \"Shame on Notre Dame\" and \"Stop Abortion Now.\" Many wore anti-abortion T-shirts, one of which depicted a leprechaun throwing a baby into a trash can and the words \"May 17, 2009, The day the dome was forever tarnished,\" which referred to the school's famed golden dome. Sunsara Taylor, a New York City resident and a member of the abortion-rights group Abortion on Demand, said outside the school's gates that \"there was a voice missing\" in the controversy over Obama's visit. \"If women don't have a right to decide if they have a child, women aren't free,\" she said. \"We need to expand abortion access and abortion rights and lift the stigma. Fetuses are not babies and women are not incubators.\" School spokesman Dennis Brown said most of the arrests Sunday were at the school's front gate, where most of the protesters angered by Obama's campus appearance had gathered. He also said three people were ejected from the commencement venue after shouting anti-abortion slogans during Obama's speech. Kathleen Hession, a graduate from Iowa City, Iowa, said after the ceremony that the protests have overshadowed the students' academic achievements. \"This is our graduation, and it's neither the time nor the place to stage something like that,\" she said. \"I respect their beliefs, but it's not the right platform.\" yahoo.com/s/ap/20090517/ap_on_re_us/us_notre_dame_protests Had I been a graduating student I would have opted not to attend.",

Every time the righties believe they have him (with their wedge issues), he comes and puts out their fire. Keep up the excellent work Mr. President. Nearly 40 protesters arrested at Notre Dame By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer \u2013 42 mins ago SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 Nearly 40 people were arrested Sunday as they tried to enter the University of Notre Dame to protest President Barack Obama's appearance at commencement, police said. At least 39 people were taken into custody on trespassing charges, police Sgt. Bill Redman said. Among those arrested were Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff identified as \"Roe\" in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. She now opposes abortion. Obama's commencement speech capped weeks of protests at the nation's most prominent Roman Catholic university. Critics have condemned the university's decision to invite Obama, who supports abortion rights and embryonic stem-cell research, and some have called for the resignation of the Rev. John Jenkins, the university's president. In his introduction for Obama, Jenkins reiterated the school's support for the church's teaching on the sanctity of human life but applauded Obama for coming to the school. \"Others might have avoided this venue for that reason, but President Obama is not someone who stops talking to those who differ with him,\" he said. Obama thanked graduates for their \"maturity and responsibility,\" acknowledging that his appearance \"has not been without controversy.\" Hundreds of people attended an outdoor Mass and rally on campus, while students who decided not to attend the commencement went elsewhere on campus for prayer. Students opposing the Obama invitation had urged peaceful protests. Victor Saenz, a philosophy graduate from Mexicali, Mexico, said attending the ceremony \"was something I just couldn't do\" because he believed Obama's invitation violated a 2004 statement adopted by U.S. bishops saying Catholic institutions should not honor those who don't adhere to church teachings. In his commencement appearance, Obama also received an honorary law degree. Bishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Notre Dame, joined the rally and called students \"heroes\" for expressing their anger over the invitation to Obama. Some students who attended the rally carried signs declaring \"Shame on Notre Dame\" and \"Stop Abortion Now.\" Many wore anti-abortion T-shirts, one of which depicted a leprechaun throwing a baby into a trash can and the words \"May 17, 2009, The day the dome was forever tarnished,\" which referred to the school's famed golden dome. Sunsara Taylor, a New York City resident and a member of the abortion-rights group Abortion on Demand, said outside the school's gates that \"there was a voice missing\" in the controversy over Obama's visit. \"If women don't have a right to decide if they have a child, women aren't free,\" she said. \"We need to expand abortion access and abortion rights and lift the stigma. Fetuses are not babies and women are not incubators.\" School spokesman Dennis Brown said most of the arrests Sunday were at the school's front gate, where most of the protesters angered by Obama's campus appearance had gathered. He also said three people were ejected from the commencement venue after shouting anti-abortion slogans during Obama's speech. Kathleen Hession, a graduate from Iowa City, Iowa, said after the ceremony that the protests have overshadowed the students' academic achievements. \"This is our graduation, and it's neither the time nor the place to stage something like that,\" she said. \"I respect their beliefs, but it's not the right platform.\" yahoo.com/s/ap/20090517/ap_on_re_us/us_notre_dame_protests Had I been a graduating student I would have opted not to attend.",

Every time the righties believe they have him (with their wedge issues), he comes and puts out their fire. Keep up the excellent work Mr. President. Nearly 40 protesters arrested at Notre Dame By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer \u2013 42 mins ago SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 Nearly 40 people were arrested Sunday as they tried to enter the University of Notre Dame to protest President Barack Obama's appearance at commencement, police said. At least 39 people were taken into custody on trespassing charges, police Sgt. Bill Redman said. Among those arrested were Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff identified as \"Roe\" in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. She now opposes abortion. Obama's commencement speech capped weeks of protests at the nation's most prominent Roman Catholic university. Critics have condemned the university's decision to invite Obama, who supports abortion rights and embryonic stem-cell research, and some have called for the resignation of the Rev. John Jenkins, the university's president. In his introduction for Obama, Jenkins reiterated the school's support for the church's teaching on the sanctity of human life but applauded Obama for coming to the school. \"Others might have avoided this venue for that reason, but President Obama is not someone who stops talking to those who differ with him,\" he said. Obama thanked graduates for their \"maturity and responsibility,\" acknowledging that his appearance \"has not been without controversy.\" Hundreds of people attended an outdoor Mass and rally on campus, while students who decided not to attend the commencement went elsewhere on campus for prayer. Students opposing the Obama invitation had urged peaceful protests. Victor Saenz, a philosophy graduate from Mexicali, Mexico, said attending the ceremony \"was something I just couldn't do\" because he believed Obama's invitation violated a 2004 statement adopted by U.S. bishops saying Catholic institutions should not honor those who don't adhere to church teachings. In his commencement appearance, Obama also received an honorary law degree.

        "reply": " Nearly 40 protesters arrested at Notre Dame By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer \u2013 42 mins ago SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 Nearly 40 people were arrested Sunday as they tried to enter the University of Notre Dame to protest President Barack Obama's appearance at commencement, police said. At least 39 people were taken into custody on trespassing charges, police Sgt. Bill Redman said. Among those arrested were Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff identified as \"Roe\" in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. She now opposes abortion. Obama's commencement speech capped weeks of protests at the nation's most prominent Roman Catholic university. Critics have condemned the university's decision to invite Obama, who supports abortion rights and embryonic stem-cell research, and some have called for the resignation of the Rev. John Jenkins, the university's president. In his introduction for Obama, Jenkins reiterated the school's support for the church's teaching on the sanctity of human life but applauded Obama for coming to the school. \"Others might have avoided this venue for that reason, but President Obama is not someone who stops talking to those who differ with him,\" he said. Obama thanked graduates for their \"maturity and responsibility,\" acknowledging that his appearance \"has not been without controversy.\" Hundreds of people attended an outdoor Mass and rally on campus, while students who decided not to attend the commencement went elsewhere on campus for prayer. Students opposing the Obama invitation had urged peaceful protests. Victor Saenz, a philosophy graduate from Mexicali, Mexico, said attending the ceremony \"was something I just couldn't do\" because he believed Obama's invitation violated a 2004 statement adopted by U.S. bishops saying Catholic institutions should not honor those who don't adhere to church teachings. In his commencement appearance, Obama also received an honorary law degree. Bishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Notre Dame, joined the rally and called students \"heroes\" for expressing their anger over the invitation to Obama. Some students who attended the rally carried signs declaring \"Shame on Notre Dame\" and \"Stop Abortion Now.\" Many wore anti-abortion T-shirts, one of which depicted a leprechaun throwing a baby into a trash can and the words \"May 17, 2009, The day the dome was forever tarnished,\" which referred to the school's famed golden dome.

Some students elected to skip the ceremoney and have a prayer vigil on the quad as a protest at the time the ceremony was being conducted, and did so with permission of the university, I support those students for standing for what they believe. The protesting groups compossed of non-Notre Dame people had no business on campus at all. The heart of the matter to me seems to be is Notre Dame going to retain its' catholic character or is it going to trade it in for publicity? Personally, I think the issuing of the invitation with the award of an honorary degree contrary to the standards set forth in 2004 regarding awards by catholic institutions to those who are at odds with church beliefs is a valid point of contention. At this point, Notre Dame is going to be forced to choose either to become more secular in nature, or else revert to their catholic roots. The invitation was made and accepted, now they will have to own the results as well. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake.

Every time the righties believe they have him (with their wedge issues), he comes and puts out their fire. Keep up the excellent work Mr. President. Nearly 40 protesters arrested at Notre Dame By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer \u2013 42 mins ago SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 Nearly 40 people were arrested Sunday as they tried to enter the University of Notre Dame to protest President Barack Obama's appearance at commencement, police said. At least 39 people were taken into custody on trespassing charges, police Sgt. Bill Redman said. Among those arrested were Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff identified as \"Roe\" in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. She now opposes abortion. Obama's commencement speech capped weeks of protests at the nation's most prominent Roman Catholic university. Critics have condemned the university's decision to invite Obama, who supports abortion rights and embryonic stem-cell research, and some have called for the resignation of the Rev. John Jenkins, the university's president. In his introduction for Obama, Jenkins reiterated the school's support for the church's teaching on the sanctity of human life but applauded Obama for coming to the school. \"Others might have avoided this venue for that reason, but President Obama is not someone who stops talking to those who differ with him,\" he said. Obama thanked graduates for their \"maturity and responsibility,\" acknowledging that his appearance \"has not been without controversy.\" Hundreds of people attended an outdoor Mass and rally on campus, while students who decided not to attend the commencement went elsewhere on campus for prayer. Students opposing the Obama invitation had urged peaceful protests. Victor Saenz, a philosophy graduate from Mexicali, Mexico, said attending the ceremony \"was something I just couldn't do\" because he believed Obama's invitation violated a 2004 statement adopted by U.S. bishops saying Catholic institutions should not honor those who don't adhere to church teachings. In his commencement appearance, Obama also received an honorary law degree. Bishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Notre Dame, joined the rally and called students \"heroes\" for expressing their anger over the invitation to Obama. Some students who attended the rally carried signs declaring \"Shame on Notre Dame\" and \"Stop Abortion Now.\" Many wore anti-abortion T-shirts, one of which depicted a leprechaun throwing a baby into a trash can and the words \"May 17, 2009, The day the dome was forever tarnished,\" which referred to the school's famed golden dome. Sunsara Taylor, a New York City resident and a member of the abortion-rights group Abortion on Demand, said outside the school's gates that \"there was a voice missing\" in the controversy over Obama's visit. \"If women don't have a right to decide if they have a child, women aren't free,\" she said. \"We need to expand abortion access and abortion rights and lift the stigma. Fetuses are not babies and women are not incubators.\" School spokesman Dennis Brown said most of the arrests Sunday were at the school's front gate, where most of the protesters angered by Obama's campus appearance had gathered. He also said three people were ejected from the commencement venue after shouting anti-abortion slogans during Obama's speech. Kathleen Hession, a graduate from Iowa City, Iowa, said after the ceremony that the protests have overshadowed the students' academic achievements. \"This is our graduation, and it's neither the time nor the place to stage something like that,\" she said. \"I respect their beliefs, but it's not the right platform.\" yahoo.com/s/ap/20090517/ap_on_re_us/us_notre_dame_protests Had I been a graduating student I would have opted not to attend.",

Looks like it can range from nothing, to a quiet \"fix yourself\", all the way to no funds from the church and the school not being permitted to call itself \"Catholic\".
