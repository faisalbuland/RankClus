As I'm sure you're aware Ray, most of those who are in Guantanamo are going to be charged with crimes, and tried in either a Civil Court, or a normal Courts Martial - In either of these eventualities - a fair trial. So this business about him \"releasing\" them is a red herring. As for Ali al-Marri, he was a legal resident of the USA, and was never charged with a crime - Now he HAS been charged with a crime. The idea of holding either a citizen or a legal resident for years without charges is anathma to American tradition. Only with the approval of Congress does the executive have the right to suspend Habeaus. Dave",

It's got to the point the continual partisan bickering about every legality that comes to view, that if they gave them a box lunch and a greyhound ticket and sent all the terrorist on their way it might serve to quite the radicals. No such luck. We've seen some divisive issues and Gitmo was one that was used and abused.
