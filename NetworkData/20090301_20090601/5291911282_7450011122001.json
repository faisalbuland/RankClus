It's a program that is still in the trial phase until the end of 2010 and it will go away if not used enough. This is a great benefit to all of us and we need to take advantage of it. Especially those that are close to retirement or are planning a discharge or for their spouse. I would be happy to help anyone out with info about it. Just ask.",

It works the same as the VA home loan all of us know about, and I hear alot of people complaining they can't get a job. Why not use a resource that we earned to provide ourselves with a job. I work for myself and I enjoy helping other vets at no cost. Just trying to help man!",
