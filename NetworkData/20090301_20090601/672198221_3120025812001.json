The outlines of the plan are expected to be unveiled this week in preparation for President Obama\u2019s first foreign summit meeting in early April. Increasing oversight of executive pay has been under consideration for some time, but the decision was made in recent days as public fury over bonuses has spilled into the regulatory effort.

Depending on the outcome of the discussions, the administration could seek to put the changes into effect through regulations rather than through legislation. One proposal could impose greater requirements on the boards of companies to tie executive compensation more closely to corporate performance and to take other steps to assure that outsize bonuses are not paid before meeting financial goals. The new rules will cover all financial institutions, including those not now covered by any pay rules because they are not receiving federal bailout money. Officials say the rules could also be applied more broadly to publicly traded companies, which already report about some executive pay practices to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Think about this for a minute! The 'Best and the Brightest' failed in many of the big financial institutions on Wall Street. NOW, the 'Best and the Brightest' in Washington (big tongue in cheek there) want to limit or at least have some control (OK, they did say oversight) of the pay of the 'Best and the Brightest' on Wall Street? I wonder which the American People will be better off with. Limiting Executive pay or TERM LIMITS? I think the latter! This should NOT be a game of the blind squirrel finding an acorn once in a while with my tax money!",
