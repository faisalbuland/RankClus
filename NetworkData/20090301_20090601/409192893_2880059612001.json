John McCaine, honorable man that he is could not put together a campaign to beat anyone, his milqtoast approach to the stupid stimulus last year did not help him. Barak Obama conducted a smart campaign, it was his time, todays convoluted situation drew people to him for hope and change that he promised. Will he deliver, yet to be determined. The Republican party has emasculated itself. Leaders? Who?? Bobby Jindahl, his first offereing, live TV wise just did not go over well, he looked weak. He will not come out as a leader in the near/distant future, too much to overcome Gov Palin, mainstream media crucifies this woman John McCaine, had his time in the sun... Michael Steele, too wishy washy Gov Huckabee, being assigned a religious zealot, rightfuly or not seems to be Romney, he has no wins in the win column Ron Paul, no way John Boehner, maybe Rush, dont be ridiculous like i said, Republican Party only has itself to blame, they did not fight the good fight, because to fight the good fight meant fiscal responsibility in both sides of Congress, they spent like drunken sailors in Po city PI... They got their clocks cleaned, and rightfully so, so it is time to clean house, re establish who this party is and what it stands for. WE need leadership, we need someone to come to forefront now and assume this position, but who, damifiknow",
