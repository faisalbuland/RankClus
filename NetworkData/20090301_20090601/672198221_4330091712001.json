The device turns out to be a suicide vest simulator for the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) training system. The original MILES system was developed in the 1980\u2019s to provide a realistic force-on-force training system for the US Army. The system utilized an array of sensors on soldiers clothing, equipment and vehicles. When a blank cartridge is fired from a MILES equipped rifle, the laser is activated and transmits information about the shooter, his weapon and ammunition. If a laser hits a sensor, the software calculates if the shot was a kill based on the range and what ammunition was being used. MILES is in use by many armed forces including the Australian, British, Czech, Irish, Israeli, Turkish and Canadian armies. The patent application, number 20090053679, describes a system where clothing is covered in light generating devices, such as LEDs, that when activated broadcast the appropriate MILES codes for a kill over a wide area. Sensors in the \u201cblast\u201d zone would then calculate the distance from the \u201cexplosion\u201d and see if it resulted in a kill.

This doesn't seem like it will be of much use. I disagree, when I spent the last 18 months on Active Duty training deploying units, we used a similar device. This will definately help with ECP training and general POW search techniques, Surveillance techniques, etc. We have(at least in 1st Army) Training Aids IED's that use powder and Co2 that can be remotely initiated much like the real IED's. I ran Lanes at Drum, Dix, Cp. Smith, FTIG, with them. Suicide Bombs in Iraq are still being used. Witness the latest TTP of using Females or the Elderly. In Afghanistan they are now being used by Foreign Fighters check CALL or check with your S2 NCO",
