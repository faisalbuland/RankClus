But look what they have done. They took no actions whatsoever after they took office to forestall Al Qaeda, although they were -explicitly- warned about AQ (and retained the #1 Clinton Admin expert on AQ, Clarke). They ginned up an invasion of Iraq when they knew Saddam was not helping AQ, and was per Colin Powell, totally contained. They used in that invasion 1/3 of the troops required to subdue Iraq (per CENTCOM plans), but then disbanded an Iraqi Army -anxious- to help us rule the country. They broke international law by waging agressive war in opposition to the UN Charter (which we large wrote).

He may be the CINC but he is still and ELECTED official that is required to obey the laws just like the rest of us. A Military tribunal would have been well within his rights as a CINC. Fast fair trial, punishment to follow. Why was that so hard? Thanks REPS! for causing our nation to be torn apart on this issue! \"A military tribunal is a kind of military court designed to try members of enemy forces during wartime, operating outside the scope of conventional criminal and civil proceedings. The judges are military officers and fulfill the role of jurors. Military tribunals are distinct from courts-martial.\" I'm not even a dang lawyer and that is not hard to figure out, that's why we have it!",
