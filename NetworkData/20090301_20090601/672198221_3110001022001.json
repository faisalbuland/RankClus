Frisco I understand your point, I honestly do and I have seen it as well. Mine is not to say nor do I believe that any particular child raised by any other than F or M are bad or even flawed in any way, quite the contrary as you stated, but I have also seen a kid messed up because of the lack of one or the other, in which they would have been ok if they had had both. A feminine mother teachers love, affection, spoils, is soft, a masculine father is discipline, manhood, survival, hardness, teachers one to earn their keep and to conquer and survive, to deal and bargain, just the male figure in itself can make it one way or the other. Just the voice in some cases. Do I believe there should be such laws? No. But overall I do feel it is better. One day we may not be so spoiled and actually have to be real hunters and gatherers once again and to actually have to survive. Don't laugh, because it very well and probably will happen one day. Maybe not in our lifetime. You can not win against nature. That I do know. But man is very good at manipulating nature. Nature is even better at correcting itself. I am sure one day man will regret that in some fashion or form if that behavior becomes dominant. Then again, nature may adjust things to allow for that behavior. Not in a religious since, my argument has nothing to do with religion. hard to explain but I am sure some here know what I am mean. No threat though as long as it is not dominant, I do not think.",

Marriage and the family isnt protected anymore and is not even held in reverance anymore, especially by liberals who think that just because it feels good and results in an orgasm then it must be good for everyone. What is next? marry a goat? allow children to marry or have sex with adults because enough people decide that its just as \"normal\" as anything else? Homosexuality was at one time considered immoral and deviant now it is called normal by some. Pedophilia is growing also right under your noses. At what point do these people stand up and declare themselves discriminated against? At what point in the future do they start parading down the streets declaring their behavior as normal and should be acceptable to all because it is their right and freedom as a human to do so?",

All children need the balance of a female mother and a male father. I will never change my mind on that because that is the nature of it all and that is indeed how it is suppose to work and what brings out a well balanced child to become a woman or a man. That's not to say a child raised otherwise is not either, but then again I think single parent children as well as same sex children are lacking a certain balance and I do think contributes to some things in this nation that are missing. ALL other things being equal I agree that in our society a 2 parent heterosexual family would be best (marginally). BUT in the real world all other things are almost NEVER equal.",

I once asked a gay female if they had all the legal rights would they still want the definition changed and she said yes, some would but she did not care about that part. Now I find myself thinking.... it seems to be so much more important for they gay community and do I really care about a definition??? As for the gay community and children. I can't buy that way of thinking. I have seen messed up people on both sides gay and straight. As long as the children are cared for and loved I don't care if it is by a mom and dad, a dad and a dad or a mom and a mom. What is your definition of marriage that homosexual are trying to change? FACTS * ALL legal marriages in the US, including religious, have a Civil (non-religious) contract element which is why they are registered. * The Civil marriage contract is NOT concerned with religion although some of the laws about Civil marriage have been influenced by religon. * There are sigificant legal benefits, protections and responsiblity provided by Civil marriage contracts * Homosexuals already HAVE access to religious marriages, including Christian. * Heterosexuals can get non-religious Civil marriage contracts but Homosexuals can not So in reality ALL that people claiming to be trying to protect religious marriage are doing is denying Civil marriage contracts to homosexuals since it does NOT have any effect on religious groups that do not already allow homosexuals to marry.",

In lesbian relationships, one of them is always the \"man\", and she is invariably more masculine than at least half the males in any city. In male/male relationships, one or both of them is invariably feminine enough, and odds are the kid isn't going to get a \"man's man\" for a father figure, anyways.",

I think that is where all the mess seems to stem from which is the legal definition of what marriage is, not in the legal aspects of insurance, adoption etc. Sure there are some radical religous people who are never going to even acknowledge any rights for the gay community. But most people that vote against gay marriage in their state do so more because they are wanting to protect their belief of what the definition of marraige means to them, not so much that they want to keep the gay community down or not let them have access to legal contractual matters. I get the gay desire for wanting legal rights. You have to get that not everyone is gay and they want the same freedom to protect and believe their way of thinking. I personally am not gay but I get others are and at this point in my life, I feel the definition is way more important to the gay community than it is to me. I think the contractual matter wont be enough and as soon as that is made a non issue, the radical gay community will then feel slighted by the wording and definition and will go after that. So, I have to then ask myself, if it means that much to another community, does my personal lifestyle choice mean enough for me to fight for? I think I can live my belief without having all this hate and division and that is a better way to handle it. I want all people to be treated equal and have all the same rights",
