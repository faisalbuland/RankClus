I do not know of one single state that mandates an immediate pulling to the right regardless of safety for emergency vehicles . All the motor vehicle laws I have seen ALWAYS mentioned safety\u2026 and many state exactly what that man did\u2026 slow down, give an indication that you will be complying and stop as soon as it is safe to do so. That cop was placing her OWN life in danger as well as the lives of the supposed purps. She definitely has some aggression problems to be trying that stopping maneuver at 5mph. The State refused to press charges\u2026 I suspect that the department WILL be settling civil allegations outside the courtroom. Stopping in less than a mile starting at 70mph? And in traffic? With snow on the roadsides? Not something even I think I might be able to do with predictable repeatability. BTW: the guy was wrong in travelling that fast\u2026 and it would be worth the ticket\u2026 but the cop totally destroyed any hope of that outcome by taking the actions she did. And why exactly did she do the stop the way she did in the first place? Something else happened that placed her into this very aggressive mindset prior to her run in with the minivan. I wonder if her department is looking into that? Or are they too busy circling the wagons? What city and state was this in?",

Thanks for the link... in looking at the three videos there I could see no place for him to pull over without leaving both his van and the police car partially on the plowed roadway. IMO the driver responded the way he should have. This is just a couple of minutes before New Years... being anywhere near a road was going to be dangerous. I am also now wondering if he was in fact speeding at all. The ONLY citation to come out of this was an unsafe lane change. I assume it was for the one on the camera. If he was speeding, it is my take that the State Police felt that they would not want their officer in court attempting to explain what happened. I expect that she is not creditable at this point. I hope the guy contests that last charge.",
