Hugo Chavez has solved a trio of vexing problems for Russia with; 1) his now-permanent status as a true \"Dick Tator\" of Venezuela; 2)TOTAL control of the country's oil and the steady wealth it produces, and; 3)his aspirations of adopting and installing strict socialism and Communism not only in Venzuela, but in the larger region of Latin America, to \"depose and offset the 'undeserving' United States\". Chavez has jumped into bed with \"Putin & Co\" big-time. Soviet long-range military aircraft/bombers have landed in Venzuela. Russian warships have made port calls and refueled with critically needed cheap and plentiful Venezuelan fuel oil there. They have transited the Panama Canal for the FIRST TIME since WW-II. Chavez and Putin have participated in numerous joint training naval/military exercises in the \"back yard\" of the United States, knowing full well how *****ly of an issue this is, and hoping to pick a fight, to see just how far the Chavez/Putin/Castro troika can push the much-weakened US/Canada/North American power bloc. Cuban and Venezuela-based airports, harbors and military bases are a very real threat, as Moscow will no longer be restrained or limited by the logistical obstacle of how and where to repair, fuel and base its ships, aircraft and ground machinery far from its own shores and friendly home territory. Add the local availability of not just the abundant fuel itself, but very CHEAP Chavez-controlled Venezuelan fuel to boot, and the \"poison\" of this volatile mix is that much more potent, as this frees up even MORE money for the Russian military to use for its increasingly aggressive operations and growth objectives. Cuba is just too close to the U.S., period. It is truly a loose cannon. Cash-starved, it will eagerly offer its real estate (airfields, ports and harbors including, ironically, the soon to be abandoned GUANTANAMO BAY) to \"Chavez, Putin & Co\" in exchange for supplies, fuel, cash and military protection. Hugo Chavez wants to fan the flames of the nascient but growing acceptance and conversion of much of Latin America to socialism and/or Communism, (under his control and promotion) to shift the balance of Latin America and regional power and influence away from the U.S., toward socialism, and ultimately, a non-Western social ideology, with Russia's military power, aid and support. They see it as a win/win situation for them. With Obama and the Democrats firmly in control of the government, and the United States severely weakened on all sides by the current economic situation, Chavez sees an irreseistable golden opportunity to push his luck and his skewed political agenda. He successfully snookered the Venezuelan people to vote to permanently scrub term limits for ALL elected officials, thus ensuring he and his like-minded minions will be around for a long time, to implement his hard-line, long-term Socialist vision for unprecedented regional social and political change. The timing for this couldn't be worse. President Obama will likely not see this ominous threat for what it is until it is far too late to counteract and eliminate it sufficiently and effectively. President Obama tends to lean toward socialism and its leftist ideologies in many ways, so Chavez and Putin are giddy with delight and happily getting their cozy relationship and plans together right under our noses, while the U.S. is occupied with dealing with the multiple and prolific distractions it is faced with. This is a recipe for DISASTER, and Chavez is poised to take every bit of any advantage that he can, with Vladimir Putin at his side and backing him all the way. Hugo Chavez has already loudly denigrated, disparaged and challenged the U.S., and he's egomaniacal enough and impetuous enough to recklessly 'cross the line' unapologetically, especially with Russia as his new ideological and regional military ally. Putin is no fool; he KNOWS this, and he will exploit it as much as he can, hiding safely behind Chavez and his outspoken brashness. Chavez; \"OK, I've CROSSED YOUR LINE...now, what are YOU gonna DO about it, HUH? C'mon!!\" That's the irrational, power-drunk \"gangster\" mentality we are dealing with in arrogant Hugo Chavez.

Chavez has jumped into bed with \"Putin & Co\" big-time. Soviet long-range military aircraft/bombers have landed in Venzuela. Russian warships have made port calls and refueled with critically needed cheap and plentiful Venezuelan fuel oil there. They have transited the Panama Canal for the FIRST TIME since WW-II. Chavez and Putin have participated in numerous joint training naval/military exercises in the \"back yard\" of the United States, knowing full well how *****ly of an issue this is, and hoping to pick a fight, to see just how far the Chavez/Putin/Castro troika can push the much-weakened US/Canada/North American power bloc. Cuban and Venezuela-based airports, harbors and military bases are a very real threat, as Moscow will no longer be restrained or limited by the logistical obstacle of how and where to repair, fuel and base its ships, aircraft and ground machinery far from its own shores and friendly home territory. Add the local availability of not just the abundant fuel itself, but very CHEAP Chavez-controlled Venezuelan fuel to boot, and the \"poison\" of this volatile mix is that much more potent, as this frees up even MORE money for the Russian military to use for its increasingly aggressive operations and growth objectives. Cuba is just too close to the U.S., period. It is truly a loose cannon. Cash-starved, it will eagerly offer its real estate (airfields, ports and harbors including, ironically, the soon to be abandoned GUANTANAMO BAY) to \"Chavez, Putin & Co\" in exchange for supplies, fuel, cash and military protection. Hugo Chavez wants to fan the flames of the nascient but growing acceptance and conversion of much of Latin America to socialism and/or Communism, (under his control and promotion) to shift the balance of Latin America and regional power and influence away from the U.S., toward socialism, and ultimately, a non-Western social ideology, with Russia's military power, aid and support. They see it as a win/win situation for them. With Obama and the Democrats firmly in control of the government, and the United States severely weakened on all sides by the current economic situation, Chavez sees an irreseistable golden opportunity to push his luck and his skewed political agenda. He successfully snookered the Venezuelan people to vote to permanently scrub term limits for ALL elected officials, thus ensuring he and his like-minded minions will be around for a long time, to implement his hard-line, long-term Socialist vision for unprecedented regional social and political change. The timing for this couldn't be worse. President Obama will likely not see this ominous threat for what it is until it is far too late to counteract and eliminate it sufficiently and effectively. President Obama tends to lean toward socialism and its leftist ideologies in many ways, so Chavez and Putin are giddy with delight and happily getting their cozy relationship and plans together right under our noses, while the U.S. is occupied with dealing with the multiple and prolific distractions it is faced with. This is a recipe for DISASTER, and Chavez is poised to take every bit of any advantage that he can, with Vladimir Putin at his side and backing him all the way. Hugo Chavez has already loudly denigrated, disparaged and challenged the U.S., and he's egomaniacal enough and impetuous enough to recklessly 'cross the line' unapologetically, especially with Russia as his new ideological and regional military ally. Putin is no fool; he KNOWS this, and he will exploit it as much as he can, hiding safely behind Chavez and his outspoken brashness.

Chavez has jumped into bed with \"Putin & Co\" big-time. Soviet long-range military aircraft/bombers have landed in Venzuela. Russian warships have made port calls and refueled with critically needed cheap and plentiful Venezuelan fuel oil there. They have transited the Panama Canal for the FIRST TIME since WW-II. Chavez and Putin have participated in numerous joint training naval/military exercises in the \"back yard\" of the United States, knowing full well how *****ly of an issue this is, and hoping to pick a fight, to see just how far the Chavez/Putin/Castro troika can push the much-weakened US/Canada/North American power bloc. Cuban and Venezuela-based airports, harbors and military bases are a very real threat, as Moscow will no longer be restrained or limited by the logistical obstacle of how and where to repair, fuel and base its ships, aircraft and ground machinery far from its own shores and friendly home territory. Add the local availability of not just the abundant fuel itself, but very CHEAP Chavez-controlled Venezuelan fuel to boot, and the \"poison\" of this volatile mix is that much more potent, as this frees up even MORE money for the Russian military to use for its increasingly aggressive operations and growth objectives. Cuba is just too close to the U.S., period. It is truly a loose cannon. Cash-starved, it will eagerly offer its real estate (airfields, ports and harbors including, ironically, the soon to be abandoned GUANTANAMO BAY) to \"Chavez, Putin & Co\" in exchange for supplies, fuel, cash and military protection. Hugo Chavez wants to fan the flames of the nascient but growing acceptance and conversion of much of Latin America to socialism and/or Communism, (under his control and promotion) to shift the balance of Latin America and regional power and influence away from the U.S., toward socialism, and ultimately, a non-Western social ideology, with Russia's military power, aid and support. They see it as a win/win situation for them. With Obama and the Democrats firmly in control of the government, and the United States severely weakened on all sides by the current economic situation, Chavez sees an irreseistable golden opportunity to push his luck and his skewed political agenda. He successfully snookered the Venezuelan people to vote to permanently scrub term limits for ALL elected officials, thus ensuring he and his like-minded minions will be around for a long time, to implement his hard-line, long-term Socialist vision for unprecedented regional social and political change. The timing for this couldn't be worse. President Obama will likely not see this ominous threat for what it is until it is far too late to counteract and eliminate it sufficiently and effectively. President Obama tends to lean toward socialism and its leftist ideologies in many ways, so Chavez and Putin are giddy with delight and happily getting their cozy relationship and plans together right under our noses, while the U.S. is occupied with dealing with the multiple and prolific distractions it is faced with. This is a recipe for DISASTER, and Chavez is poised to take every bit of any advantage that he can, with Vladimir Putin at his side and backing him all the way. Hugo Chavez has already loudly denigrated, disparaged and challenged the U.S., and he's egomaniacal enough and impetuous enough to recklessly 'cross the line' unapologetically, especially with Russia as his new ideological and regional military ally. Putin is no fool; he KNOWS this, and he will exploit it as much as he can, hiding safely behind Chavez and his outspoken brashness. Chavez; \"OK, I've CROSSED YOUR LINE...now, what are YOU gonna DO about it, HUH? C'mon!!\" That's the irrational, power-drunk \"gangster\" mentality we are dealing with in arrogant Hugo Chavez. Think about this. I invite your views and input on this precarious situation. Take a Valium or something - - If both sides rattle their swords a little, that will crank up industries in both countries and put people back to work. Keep a few \"brush-fire\" wars going here and there reduces unemployment, inventory, and excess population while....

Chavez has jumped into bed with \"Putin & Co\" big-time. Soviet long-range military aircraft/bombers have landed in Venzuela. Russian warships have made port calls and refueled with critically needed cheap and plentiful Venezuelan fuel oil there. They have transited the Panama Canal for the FIRST TIME since WW-II. Chavez and Putin have participated in numerous joint training naval/military exercises in the \"back yard\" of the United States, knowing full well how *****ly of an issue this is, and hoping to pick a fight, to see just how far the Chavez/Putin/Castro troika can push the much-weakened US/Canada/North American power bloc. Cuban and Venezuela-based airports, harbors and military bases are a very real threat, as Moscow will no longer be restrained or limited by the logistical obstacle of how and where to repair, fuel and base its ships, aircraft and ground machinery far from its own shores and friendly home territory. Add the local availability of not just the abundant fuel itself, but very CHEAP Chavez-controlled Venezuelan fuel to boot, and the \"poison\" of this volatile mix is that much more potent, as this frees up even MORE money for the Russian military to use for its increasingly aggressive operations and growth objectives. Cuba is just too close to the U.S., period. It is truly a loose cannon. Cash-starved, it will eagerly offer its real estate (airfields, ports and harbors including, ironically, the soon to be abandoned GUANTANAMO BAY) to \"Chavez, Putin & Co\" in exchange for supplies, fuel, cash and military protection. Hugo Chavez wants to fan the flames of the nascient but growing acceptance and conversion of much of Latin America to socialism and/or Communism, (under his control and promotion) to shift the balance of Latin America and regional power and influence away from the U.S., toward socialism, and ultimately, a non-Western social ideology, with Russia's military power, aid and support. They see it as a win/win situation for them. With Obama and the Democrats firmly in control of the government, and the United States severely weakened on all sides by the current economic situation, Chavez sees an irreseistable golden opportunity to push his luck and his skewed political agenda. He successfully snookered the Venezuelan people to vote to permanently scrub term limits for ALL elected officials, thus ensuring he and his like-minded minions will be around for a long time, to implement his hard-line, long-term Socialist vision for unprecedented regional social and political change. The timing for this couldn't be worse. President Obama will likely not see this ominous threat for what it is until it is far too late to counteract and eliminate it sufficiently and effectively. President Obama tends to lean toward socialism and its leftist ideologies in many ways, so Chavez and Putin are giddy with delight and happily getting their cozy relationship and plans together right under our noses, while the U.S. is occupied with dealing with the multiple and prolific distractions it is faced with. This is a recipe for DISASTER, and Chavez is poised to take every bit of any advantage that he can, with Vladimir Putin at his side and backing him all the way. Hugo Chavez has already loudly denigrated, disparaged and challenged the U.S., and he's egomaniacal enough and impetuous enough to recklessly 'cross the line' unapologetically, especially with Russia as his new ideological and regional military ally.

His Latino machismo is on the line, and that makes for a very dangerous, 'hair-trigger' type situation. Chavez also wants vindication, not to be proven wrong or in any way presumptive. That would be totally unacceptable to him---humiliation and having his beloved Socialist vision proved undeniably wrong, dishonest and disadvantageous to all those who he misled and snookered to achieve his ends. That would be his undoing. That scenario and possibility has to be avoided at any and all cost. This is why Chavez is so dangerous, especially with Russia now playing.",

Hugo Chavez has solved a trio of vexing problems for Russia with; 1) his now-permanent status as a true \"Dick Tator\" of Venezuela; 2)TOTAL control of the country's oil and the steady wealth it produces, and; 3)his aspirations of adopting and installing strict socialism and Communism not only in Venzuela, but in the larger region of Latin America, to \"depose and offset the 'undeserving' United States\". Chavez has jumped into bed with \"Putin & Co\" big-time. Soviet long-range military aircraft/bombers have landed in Venzuela. Russian warships have made port calls and refueled with critically needed cheap and plentiful Venezuelan fuel oil there. They have transited the Panama Canal for the FIRST TIME since WW-II. Chavez and Putin have participated in numerous joint training naval/military exercises in the \"back yard\" of the United States, knowing full well how *****ly of an issue this is, and hoping to pick a fight, to see just how far the Chavez/Putin/Castro troika can push the much-weakened US/Canada/North American power bloc. Cuban and Venezuela-based airports, harbors and military bases are a very real threat, as Moscow will no longer be restrained or limited by the logistical obstacle of how and where to repair, fuel and base its ships, aircraft and ground machinery far from its own shores and friendly home territory. Add the local availability of not just the abundant fuel itself, but very CHEAP Chavez-controlled Venezuelan fuel to boot, and the \"poison\" of this volatile mix is that much more potent, as this frees up even MORE money for the Russian military to use for its increasingly aggressive operations and growth objectives. Cuba is just too close to the U.S., period. It is truly a loose cannon. Cash-starved, it will eagerly offer its real estate (airfields, ports and harbors including, ironically, the soon to be abandoned GUANTANAMO BAY) to \"Chavez, Putin & Co\" in exchange for supplies, fuel, cash and military protection. Hugo Chavez wants to fan the flames of the nascient but growing acceptance and conversion of much of Latin America to socialism and/or Communism, (under his control and promotion) to shift the balance of Latin America and regional power and influence away from the U.S., toward socialism, and ultimately, a non-Western social ideology, with Russia's military power, aid and support. They see it as a win/win situation for them. With Obama and the Democrats firmly in control of the government, and the United States severely weakened on all sides by the current economic situation, Chavez sees an irreseistable golden opportunity to push his luck and his skewed political agenda. He successfully snookered the Venezuelan people to vote to permanently scrub term limits for ALL elected officials, thus ensuring he and his like-minded minions will be around for a long time, to implement his hard-line, long-term Socialist vision for unprecedented regional social and political change. The timing for this couldn't be worse. President Obama will likely not see this ominous threat for what it is until it is far too late to counteract and eliminate it sufficiently and effectively. President Obama tends to lean toward socialism and its leftist ideologies in many ways, so Chavez and Putin are giddy with delight and happily getting their cozy relationship and plans together right under our noses, while the U.S. is occupied with dealing with the multiple and prolific distractions it is faced with. This is a recipe for DISASTER, and Chavez is poised to take every bit of any advantage that he can, with Vladimir Putin at his side and backing him all the way. Hugo Chavez has already loudly denigrated, disparaged and challenged the U.S., and he's egomaniacal enough and impetuous enough to recklessly 'cross the line' unapologetically, especially with Russia as his new ideological and regional military ally. Putin is no fool; he KNOWS this, and he will exploit it as much as he can, hiding safely behind Chavez and his outspoken brashness. Chavez; \"OK, I've CROSSED YOUR LINE...now, what are YOU gonna DO about it, HUH? C'mon!!\" That's the irrational, power-drunk \"gangster\" mentality we are dealing with in arrogant Hugo Chavez.

Add the local availability of not just the abundant fuel itself, but very CHEAP Chavez-controlled Venezuelan fuel to boot, and the \"poison\" of this volatile mix is that much more potent, as this frees up even MORE money for the Russian military to use for its increasingly aggressive operations and growth objectives. Cuba is just too close to the U.S., period. It is truly a loose cannon.",

Eliminate ammo=eliminate guns, without having to come through the front door of the Constitution. The Founding Fathers never could have foreseen such a crooked and extremely liberal, socialist-oriented group of elected officials so dead set on overriding and gutting the 2nd Amendment. This is just the beginning. Now, the anti-gun Dems will aim for ammo manufacturers, new and reloaders, and concoct some way to put them out of business once and for all. This is the target weakness, the \"Achilles' Heel\" to disarm lawful gun owners by rendering their firearms useless, without any ammunition available for them. Currently available supplies will 1) be sold and exhausted; 2)reloading equipment suppliers will be outlawed and legislated out of existence; 3) any new ammo will be hyper-controlled, inventoried, signed for and hyper-documented to the very shell casing and materials used to manufacture it. Obama & the oath-violating, yellow-striped gutless losers like Charles Schumer and all the rest of his lying, overpaid, illegal anti-gun liberals will now move in to quickly, effectively GUT the 2nd Amendment as surely as if it had been repealed by an illegal Act or a coup attempt against the American people by the liberal Democrats. They are already planning on using altered voting status on bills to render the Republican votes in Congress for legislation to pass useless and unneeded. They will circumvent the opposing views to any and all laws they truly want to get passed, no matter how MAD the opposition or the People get about this hijacking of the Congress and the government. So many duped voters wanted radical, sweeping \"change\" so badly, they're going to have it rammed down everyone's throat now. The real agenda is being implemented, and as Rahm Emmanuel says, \"Never waste a crisis...\", the Dems are rushing their radical leftist agenda into reality as fast as possible. President Obama shrugs his shoulders and declares the presence of long-range Russian bombers in Venezuela and Cuba \"...no big deal...so what? Let 'em be there.\" Ya have to wonder about THAT attitude. When the Russian ships and subs come to join the aircraft, he'll shrug his shoulders and cock his head like he does now. As I have stated in this thread, and confirmed in part already by these ongoing, unfolding events...we had better be on our toes.",
