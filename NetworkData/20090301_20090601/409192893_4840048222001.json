Hill Briefed on Waterboarding in 2002 In Meetings, Spy Panels' Chiefs Did Not Protest, Officials Say By Joby Warrick and Dan Eggen Washington Post Staff Writers Sunday, December 9, 2007; A01 In September 2002, four members of Congress met in secret for a first look at a unique CIA program designed to wring vital information from reticent terrorism suspects in U.S. custody. For more than an hour, the bipartisan group, which included current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), was given a virtual tour of the CIA's overseas detention sites and the harsh techniques interrogators had devised to try to make their prisoners talk. Among the techniques described, said two officials present, was waterboarding, a practice that years later would be condemned as torture by Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill. But on that day, no objections were raised. Instead, at least two lawmakers in the room asked the CIA to push harder, two U.S. officials said. \"The briefer was specifically asked if the methods were tough enough,\" said a U.S. official who witnessed the exchange. Congressional leaders from both parties would later seize on waterboarding as a symbol of the worst excesses of the Bush administration's counterterrorism effort. The CIA last week admitted that videotape of an interrogation of one of the waterboarded detainees was destroyed in 2005 against the advice of Justice Department and White House officials, provoking allegations that its actions were illegal and the destruction was a coverup. Yet long before \"waterboarding\" entered the public discourse, the CIA gave key legislative overseers about 30 private briefings, some of which included descriptions of that technique and other harsh interrogation methods, according to interviews with multiple U.S. officials with firsthand knowledge. ---snip--- Another source\u2026 - taken from the report\u2026 In September 2002, four members of Congress met in secret for a first look at a unique CIA program designed to wring vital information from reticent terrorism suspects in U.S. custody.

Intelligence Report: Pelosi Briefed on Use of Interrogation Tactics in Sept. \u201902 ABC News\u2019 Rick Klein reports: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was briefed on the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d on terrorist suspect Abu Zubaydah in September 2002, according to a report prepared by the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s office and obtained by ABC News. ----snip---- \u2026The report also details dozens of other meetings with members of Congress -- though not with Pelosi present -- where the use of waterboarding and other interrogation techniques was described. The Senate intelligence committee\u2019s chairman and ranking member, Bob Graham and Richard Shelby, were given a briefing similar to the one with Pelosi and Goss on Sept. 27, 2002, according to the report. On Feb. 4, 2003, a briefing on \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d for Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., revealed that interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Abd Al-Rahim Al-Nashiri were taped. In addition, that briefing \u201cdescribed in considerable details\u201d the techniques used, including \u201chow the water board was used.\u201d A similar briefing the following day included Goss and Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., who by that time had become the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, when Pelosi moved on to become minority leader. The report is accompanied by a letter from CIA Director Leon Panetta to intelligence committee leaders that describes the way it was compiled: \u201cThis letter presents the most thorough information we have on dates, locations, and names of all Members of Congress who were briefed by the CIA on enhanced interrogation techniques. This information, however, is drawn from the past files of the CIA and represents [memorandums for the record] completed at the time and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals. In the end, you and the Committee will have to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened. We can make the MFRs available at CIA for staff review.\u201d ---snip---",

You can talk about this Democrat/Republican/conservative/liberal nonsense all you want - it gets us nowhere. This is pathetic. What a bunch of fools. Regarding torture \u2013 IMHO \u2013 I would leave up to the military command. There are times when things must be done that the general public does NOT need to know. I would trust the judgment of Gen Petraeus and his decision in a given moment than any politician EVER. Fighting al Qaeda pretending they are some military enemy is suicide for this country. These people are NOT out to gain anything \u2013 they are NOT seeking peace \u2013 money \u2013 geography \u2013 power \u2013 etc\u2026 They are seeking our DEATH \u2013 PERIOD. Accommodating them, appeasing them, ignoring them, and/or \u201choping\u201d some Middle East Country will take care of it is SUICIDE. This is NOT a freaking army. In fact, I would not give them HUMAN status. They are worse than rabid animals and should EXTERMINATED from the planet. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, Syria, and every other country allowing these vermin to breathe should be put on notice. We will destroy them NO MATTER where they are \u2013 including the Palaces \u2013 Cities \u2013 or wherever they are suspected. We should fire-off a dozen missiles taking out ALL of Iran\u2019s oil refineries and pumping stations. Then give them ONE stern warning \u2013 if they retaliate we WILL USE OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL to eradicate Iran from the globe\u2026 If they do it anyway, then we SHOULD deliver our promise. Anyone thinks we can negotiate with militant twisted malcontents on a religious mission to destroy the infidels to usher in their coming end-times \u2013 well, we should simply accommodate their prophecy and eliminate them from the planet \u2013 sending them to their paradise. Hey, sorry, I\u2019ll catch the next ride\u2026 We are NOT less-than or inhumane \u2013 or somehow reverting to barbarism simply because THOSE IDIOTS don\u2019t get the message. They are planning right now to attack this country. When Iran gets its nukes \u2013 they will use them against Israel. They will NUKE that place to begin their world war. If not, then why in the hell don\u2019t we pull out of A-stan & Iraq now \u2013 and let the Saudis and Egypt go in and pick up the pieces\u2026 they are after all their Muslim brothers \u2013 why aren\u2019t they helping\u2026? Why are we sending the freaking Palestinians 900-freaking million dollars? What kind of stupid idiot thinks they will use that money for anything decent? Hillary is a jackass for even considering something asinine like that\u2026 She should have gone over to the Saudis and told them \u2013 you are doing the whining get your freaking oil-rich butts over there and FIX the place\u2026 Otherwise \u2013 Israel should be given the go-ahead to remove ALL Palestinians from the region. If Syria even sneezes in that direction \u2013 bust them with about 50-bunker busters in the center of their cities \u2013 and tell them the next will one will GLOW\u2026 Only a fool thinks these people are going to negotiate and keep their word. The Saudis and some of the others may be won over years down the road however, until THEY start rooting out this twisted malcontents teaching their American hatred \u2013 then they should ALL be treated as suspect. It\u2019s time to put up or shut up \u2013 and WE will do the shutting up if necessary. This country is too wide-open to keep screwing around with these idiots.

We should fire-off a dozen missiles taking out ALL of Iran\u2019s oil refineries and pumping stations. Then give them ONE stern warning \u2013 if they retaliate we WILL USE OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL to eradicate Iran from the globe\u2026 If they do it anyway, then we SHOULD deliver our promise. Anyone thinks we can negotiate with militant twisted malcontents on a religious mission to destroy the infidels to usher in their coming end-times \u2013 well, we should simply accommodate their prophecy and eliminate them from the planet \u2013 sending them to their paradise. Hey, sorry, I\u2019ll catch the next ride\u2026 We are NOT less-than or inhumane \u2013 or somehow reverting to barbarism simply because THOSE IDIOTS don\u2019t get the message. They are planning right now to attack this country. When Iran gets its nukes \u2013 they will use them against Israel. They will NUKE that place to begin their world war. If not, then why in the hell don\u2019t we pull out of A-stan & Iraq now \u2013 and let the Saudis and Egypt go in and pick up the pieces\u2026 they are after all their Muslim brothers \u2013 why aren\u2019t they helping\u2026? Why are we sending the freaking Palestinians 900-freaking million dollars? What kind of stupid idiot thinks they will use that money for anything decent? Hillary is a jackass for even considering something asinine like that\u2026 She should have gone over to the Saudis and told them \u2013 you are doing the whining get your freaking oil-rich butts over there and FIX the place\u2026 Otherwise \u2013 Israel should be given the go-ahead to remove ALL Palestinians from the region. If Syria even sneezes in that direction \u2013 bust them with about 50-bunker busters in the center of their cities \u2013 and tell them the next will one will GLOW\u2026 Only a fool thinks these people are going to negotiate and keep their word. The Saudis and some of the others may be won over years down the road however, until THEY start rooting out this twisted malcontents teaching their American hatred \u2013 then they should ALL be treated as suspect. It\u2019s time to put up or shut up \u2013 and WE will do the shutting up if necessary. This country is too wide-open to keep screwing around with these idiots. How hard would it be to plant a dozen small nukes from Russia\u2019s old arsenal in those Saudi yachts and park them around in NY, Miami, California, Baltimore, etc, and all attached to ONE big ALARM clock\u2026? It is impossible for us to even detect something like that\u2026 I do NOT believe there is ANYTHING we should limit ourselves to when dealing with THESE animals. These people do NOT deserve to be treated like OTHER COUNTRIES at war. Doing so, is a huge mistake. We learned that already, didn\u2019t we\u2026 70% of those released have been killed or recaptured\u2026 I can tell you they WOULD NOT be captured again if I were on the field \u2013 I\u2019d drop that bum \u2013 right there and then. Simply because we treat these animals harshly does NOT in anyway reduce our status in the world and it does NOT mean we would ever do that fighting a convential war. We have always treated our prisoners with respect. I refuse to be manipulated by the bs of what the \"world\" thinks about us. I don't CARE what we hear... These are NOT normal people we are fighting they are WORSE THAN ANY SWINE FLU and they will kill YOU at every opportunity - even killing themselves. They deserve NO MERCY and they are NOT human beings. They should be exterminated and removed from the planet. Just my thoughts It's still illegal, and we don't get to choose those times when we can ignore the law.",

It's not about terrorists or your thoroughly disproven links between Saddam & OBL. It's about America and we're better than that, or at least we were. I disagree \u2013 the STRAWMAN is this fallacious notion that simply because \u201cWE\u201d used enhanced techniques \u2013 tightly controlled and administered by \u201cprofessionals\u201d that we somehow lost our moral compass\u2026 I mean, honestly\u2026 what kind of logic is that? Guilt manipulation is somewhat tiring after a while\u2026 It has absolutely NOTHING to do with a freaking popularity contest. It is absurd to assert the United States of America has lowered her standards simply because she will use whatever means necessary to protect her citizens. Leaping to hyper-exaggerations implying as if we regularly practice heinous torture techniques upon any & all \u2013 at random \u2013 is kind-a absurd. First of all \u2013 it is quite an exaggeration to simply \u201cproclaim\u201d we were \u201ctorturing\u201d as if it were a hobby and done for the hell of it. The insinuation is a disingenuous and a disservice to our country and it is implied every time the subject broached. It\u2019s as if there was some special torture HD channel setup so all Americans get their blood-lust fix\u2026 Secondly \u2013 the techniques used are subjective at best and one would think that SHOULD probably be the norm within THOSE particular circumstances. I mean honestly, isn\u2019t the idea to portray - whatever is necessary will be done \u2013 while NOT telling them it only goes up to the \u201cinfamous\u201d imaginary line? When untold lives may be at risk there are times when innovative techniques may be required. Or should we hand out torture preparation booklets for the enemy so they can train and be ready? Thirdly, regardless \u201cwhat\u201d we do to this enemy (short of extermination) \u2013 they will continue coming until they kill, maim, and destroy all infidels. This is not an enemy seeking to conquer, riches, or territory. They seek only to kill & destroy. Do you think if we\u2019re nice to them they\u2019ll be nice to us \u2013 maybe only take out ONE building next time..? Finally, it is disingenuous and absurd to assert that \u201cAMERICA\u201d is somehow lesser than because we are forced to use such tactics that this enemy seems to comprehend. Maybe Nancy, Harry, and Kerry, could fly over and talk with those dysfunctional misunderstood boys. Maybe Obama could fly over and do some type of BLAME AMERICA TOUR throughout the ME\u2026 He seems to be good at that\u2026 The rationale behind this schism is WRONG! If they did nothing and we were attacked in LA killing thousands more people, this same crowd would screaming CRUCIFY HIM \u2013 CRUCIFY HIM! When those at GITMO are finally released \u2013 and this nation is attacked by one or two of them \u2013 who will you blame \u2013 Bush for making them mad \u2013 or \u2013 Obama for releasing them? Kind-a funny how Nancy & Reid swore they end the war in Iraq and bring our soldiers home \u2013 2005 \u2013 and golly-gee we\u2019re still there\u2026 Hypocrisy in this instance \u2013 regarding the lying democrats claiming Bush & Cheney should prosecuted for \u201ctorturing\u201d when all along those lying hypocrites thought that because those meetings were classified NO ONE would find out about them\u2026 Bush did what he did because he was trying to do whatever possible to protect us.

Whatever there sins are, high or low, we share them. Morality \u2013 Jihadist \u2013 Morality \u2013 Terrorist \u2013 have you ever heard of a MORAL terrorist? Do you know the difference between those we are fighting now from when we attacked Saddam? Do you believe there is a difference? Who do we negotiate with to arrange their surrender? What depot do we bomb to remove their weaponry? Who is that new neighbor down the street driving by taking pictures of the schools, bridges, and government buildings..? Morality sure seems mysterious these days. Rule number ONE! - A DEAD society is NOT a MORAL society and has NO NEED FOR MORALS\u2026! A moral society is a DEAD SOCIETY if it ever attempts or believes it can wage a MORAL WAR! WAR is NOT MORAL! The conclusion to such rationale means, - a solider is a murderer while taking out the enemy\u2026 a policeman is a murderer when he takes out the bank robber\u2026 a father should be sentenced to life in prison for defending his family from the murderous intruder..? Seems to me society is able to reconcile the difference between those circumstances \u2013 otherwise all of the above would be guilty of immoral murder. So, let\u2019s take it down a notch \u2013 say we have a group of known terrorists\u2026 they are sentenced to life in prison \u2013 Nancy\u2019s daughter takes over her mom\u2019s thrown and declares \u2013 life in prison is inhumane \u2013 it is an indirect form of torture\u2026 therefore we should NOT hold human species in confined areas for more than one year\u2026 It is after-all a \u201cmoral\u201d choice \u2013 it might be a ******* moral choice but it is a moral choice \u2013 so, where do you draw that line. Does that mean then that we\u2019ve reached the pinnacle of morality if we could just learn that shooting back at terrorists is also torture \u2013 because after all \u2013 if the subjective opinion were left up to a true/blue pacifist \u2013 it is \u201cimmoral\u201d to return violence with violence\u2026 or are you saying \u201cyour\u201d morals are better than the pacifist\u2019s morals? Allies \u2013 MOST of our ALLIES would have REALLY TORTURED them. Again your logic is flawed \u2013 to accept what you are saying means that \u2013 if a policeman takes out the bank robber \u2013 shoots him dead because he refused to throw down his weapon \u2013 your logic is \u2013 that policeman should be removed from service because he/she are so \u201ctainted\u201d by killing the first person \u2013 they can no longer restrain themselves from drawing their weapon at every bank robbery \u2013 in fact, it is progressive so eventually, that cop will start shooting people for speeding\u2026 You may not agree BUT THAT is what you are saying\u2026! If we went to war with Iran tomorrow, do you think our military would immediately start grabbing the Iranian prisoners and torturing them? Suppose it was Russia \u2013 do you think we\u2019d just start torturing Russian soldiers\u2026? I don\u2019t think so\u2026 Comparing what we did \u2013 and the effort that went into \u201cassuring\u201d minimum long term damage \u2013 to what Saddam or al Qaeda have done - is ridiculous! If you can\u2019t tell the difference than THAT is exactly WHY the public shouldn\u2019t KNOW some of the necessary ugly things are done. I saw a clip a few years ago of an insurgent running straight towards an Abrams with a grenade launcher - I\u2019m not sure WHAT they shot him with \u2013 the clip shows him running straight up the dirt road directly at the tank \u2013 the gunner shot in front of him \u2013 I assume hoping the knucklehead would STOP\u2026 Sadly, he kept coming and trying to get the grenade launcher ready \u2013 I don\u2019t know what they shot him with but what I distinctly remember was watching his torso and legs still running forward \u2013 but there was NO BODY attached\u2026 Our guys DID the RIGHT THING \u2013 was it moral \u2013 YES\u2026 IS THAT MORAL \u2013 NO!

The real question here is how to define torture, and whether or not the assorted \"enhanced techniques\" count. It does not speak well for us that the vast majority of our allies think so, and that we also decried similar techniques when used on US personnel in the past. It also legititmatizes these techniques - while hard-core terrorists had already moved past this level, there are a whole host of opportunities for lesser baddies (and other governments) to skip these in on us now. The issue of it having been \"tightly controlled and administered by professionals\" is meaningless - we allowed it, it was our elected officials acting on our behalf. Whatever there sins are, high or low, we share them.", 
        "reply": " Morality \u2013 Jihadist \u2013 Morality \u2013 Terrorist \u2013 have you ever heard of a MORAL terrorist? Do you know the difference between those we are fighting now from when we attacked Saddam? Do you believe there is a difference? Who do we negotiate with to arrange their surrender? What depot do we bomb to remove their weaponry? Who is that new neighbor down the street driving by taking pictures of the schools, bridges, and government buildings..? Morality sure seems mysterious these days. Rule number ONE! - A DEAD society is NOT a MORAL society and has NO NEED FOR MORALS\u2026! A moral society is a DEAD SOCIETY if it ever attempts or believes it can wage a MORAL WAR! WAR is NOT MORAL! The conclusion to such rationale means, - a solider is a murderer while taking out the enemy\u2026 a policeman is a murderer when he takes out the bank robber\u2026 a father should be sentenced to life in prison for defending his family from the murderous intruder..? Seems to me society is able to reconcile the difference between those circumstances \u2013 otherwise all of the above would be guilty of immoral murder. So, let\u2019s take it down a notch \u2013 say we have a group of known terrorists\u2026 they are sentenced to life in prison \u2013 Nancy\u2019s daughter takes over her mom\u2019s thrown and declares \u2013 life in prison is inhumane \u2013 it is an indirect form of torture\u2026 therefore we should NOT hold human species in confined areas for more than one year\u2026 It is after-all a \u201cmoral\u201d choice \u2013 it might be a ******* moral choice but it is a moral choice \u2013 so, where do you draw that line. Does that mean then that we\u2019ve reached the pinnacle of morality if we could just learn that shooting back at terrorists is also torture \u2013 because after all \u2013 if the subjective opinion were left up to a true/blue pacifist \u2013 it is \u201cimmoral\u201d to return violence with violence\u2026 or are you saying \u201cyour\u201d morals are better than the pacifist\u2019s morals? Allies \u2013 MOST of our ALLIES would have REALLY TORTURED them. Again your logic is flawed \u2013 to accept what you are saying means that \u2013 if a policeman takes out the bank robber \u2013 shoots him dead because he refused to throw down his weapon \u2013 your logic is \u2013 that policeman should be removed from service because he/she are so \u201ctainted\u201d by killing the first person \u2013 they can no longer restrain themselves from drawing their weapon at every bank robbery \u2013 in fact, it is progressive so eventually, that cop will start shooting people for speeding\u2026 You may not agree BUT THAT is what you are saying\u2026! If we went to war with Iran tomorrow, do you think our military would immediately start grabbing the Iranian prisoners and torturing them? Suppose it was Russia \u2013 do you think we\u2019d just start torturing Russian soldiers\u2026? I don\u2019t think so\u2026 Comparing what we did \u2013 and the effort that went into \u201cassuring\u201d minimum long term damage \u2013 to what Saddam or al Qaeda have done - is ridiculous! If you can\u2019t tell the difference than THAT is exactly WHY the public shouldn\u2019t KNOW some of the necessary ugly things are done. I saw a clip a few years ago of an insurgent running straight towards an Abrams with a grenade launcher - I\u2019m not sure WHAT they shot him with \u2013 the clip shows him running straight up the dirt road directly at the tank \u2013 the gunner shot in front of him \u2013 I assume hoping the knucklehead would STOP\u2026 Sadly, he kept coming and trying to get the grenade launcher ready \u2013 I don\u2019t know what they shot him with but what I distinctly remember was watching his torso and legs still running forward \u2013 but there was NO BODY attached\u2026 Our guys DID the RIGHT THING \u2013 was it moral \u2013 YES\u2026 IS THAT MORAL \u2013 NO! Do you understand the difference? quote: Originally posted by cosmicfish: The word \"torture\" applies for several different motivations. While I think most would agree that a sadist doing it for fun is worse, we don't get to call what we did something else just because we didn't do it for kicks. Further, proclaiming we DIDN'T do it for kicks is almost certainly a little false - I would be quite surprised if the interrogators did not find it a little satisfying. Rage and anger was natural after 9/11 - but that didn't make it right. I won\u2019t even comment on that \u2013 I trust our military men & women to be the best in the world. Do we screw up \u2013 YEP \u2013 but I am NOT going to second guess them. They are professional enough to handle their own problems. Have you ever had a gun stuck in your face by some half-twisted nit-wit? quote: Originally posted by cosmicfish: No, it is not to our advantage to have that information out in the open. As you said, it provides our enemies with a standard against which to prepare. But just as people in court must expose there secret finances and affairs, so too did we need to expose our operations in the court of public opinion. We sacrificed that advantage in an attempt to regain standing with our allies at home and abroad. Feel free to disagree with that decision - there is no answer that does not cost us something important. Kind-a strange how the democrats REPEATEDLY \u2013 ANNOUNCED every DETAIL to the enemy OVER & OVER & OVER \u2013 proclaiming to the world our soldiers were torturers, malcontents, liars, thieves, rapists, undisciplined thugs, - NANCY \u2013 HILLARY \u2013 HARRY \u2013 SCHUMER \u2013 DURBIN \u2013 MURTHA \u2013 FIENGOLD \u2013 LEVIN \u2013 and the list goes on\u2026 but I could never figure out why the WAITED AN ENTIRE YEAR AFTER our military was investigating the problems \u2013 already disciplined some \u2013 but the DEMOCRATS couldn\u2019t help themselves \u2013 overcome by moral confession I guess \u2013 they announced to everywhere they went.
