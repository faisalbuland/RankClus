The press, in it's infinite, Democratically-controlled mentality, blew it completely out of context! It's you and the other terminally-ill sheeple that are suffering the still-infectious disease that has been diagnosed as \"BDS\" still refuse to accept that information as gospel...even when the CO of said Naval vessel explained the facts behind that banner! I'll take the word of a Navy ship's Captain way over your constant rantings and ravings any day. Your candidate is on really thin ice already for his gaffes and early screw ups...it seems that he just can't get good, honest individuals named to fill certain offices...only to find that they can't even pay their damn taxes, or some other 'forgetfulness' has suddenly surfaced! The Republicans in BOTH the Senate and House, as well as a few Demos have seen thru his smoke and mirrors-related strategies this early on...and have called it for what it is... All the crap that has been coming down of late is on HIS CURRENT WATCH...NOT HIS PREDCECESSORS...and HE is getting his clock cleaned on a daily basis... Your own personal 'Titantic' is rapidly sinking in that Egyptian River...and those of us who have forcasted this sinking aren't going to toss you any Life Preservers...you're on your own... You lemmings brought him in...believed his rehortic...hook, line and sinker... The '100 days' are not over by a long shot...but, the so-called 'honeymoon phase' was over after the first 24 hours... How does it feel to be on the receiving end...and I've just started!",

Stop replying to him, and like the petulant child in need of attention he is, he'll go somewhere else for his validation. He brings nothing but discord to this site. Ignore him and let him sulk in his own deviant mentality. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

The press, in it's infinite, Democratically-controlled mentality, blew it completely out of context! It's you and the other terminally-ill sheeple that are suffering the still-infectious disease that has been diagnosed as \"BDS\" still refuse to accept that information as gospel...even when the CO of said Naval vessel explained the facts behind that banner! I'll take the word of a Navy ship's Captain way over your constant rantings and ravings any day. Your candidate is on really thin ice already for his gaffes and early screw ups...it seems that he just can't get good, honest individuals named to fill certain offices...only to find that they can't even pay their damn taxes, or some other 'forgetfulness' has suddenly surfaced! The Republicans in BOTH the Senate and House, as well as a few Demos have seen thru his smoke and mirrors-related strategies this early on...and have called it for what it is... All the crap that has been coming down of late is on HIS CURRENT WATCH...NOT HIS PREDCECESSORS...and HE is getting his clock cleaned on a daily basis... Your own personal 'Titantic' is rapidly sinking in that Egyptian River...and those of us who have forcasted this sinking aren't going to toss you any Life Preservers...you're on your own... You lemmings brought him in...believed his rehortic...hook, line and sinker... The '100 days' are not over by a long shot...but, the so-called 'honeymoon phase' was over after the first 24 hours... How does it feel to be on the receiving end...and I've just started!",

Stop replying to him, and like the petulant child in need of attention he is, he'll go somewhere else for his validation. He brings nothing but discord to this site. Ignore him and let him sulk in his own deviant mentality. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

It's you and the other terminally-ill sheeple that are suffering the still-infectious disease that has been diagnosed as \"BDS\" still refuse to accept that information as gospel...even when the CO of said Naval vessel explained the facts behind that banner! I'll take the word of a Navy ship's Captain way over your constant rantings and ravings any day. Your candidate is on really thin ice already for his gaffes and early screw ups...it seems that he just can't get good, honest individuals named to fill certain offices...only to find that they can't even pay their damn taxes, or some other 'forgetfulness' has suddenly surfaced! The Republicans in BOTH the Senate and House, as well as a few Demos have seen thru his smoke and mirrors-related strategies this early on...and have called it for what it is... All the crap that has been coming down of late is on HIS CURRENT WATCH...NOT HIS PREDCECESSORS...and HE is getting his clock cleaned on a daily basis... Your own personal 'Titantic' is rapidly sinking in that Egyptian River...and those of us who have forcasted this sinking aren't going to toss you any Life Preservers...you're on your own... You lemmings brought him in...believed his rehortic...hook, line and sinker... The '100 days' are not over by a long shot...but, the so-called 'honeymoon phase' was over after the first 24 hours... How does it feel to be on the receiving end...and I've just started!",

Stop replying to him, and like the petulant child in need of attention he is, he'll go somewhere else for his validation. He brings nothing but discord to this site. Ignore him and let him sulk in his own deviant mentality. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
