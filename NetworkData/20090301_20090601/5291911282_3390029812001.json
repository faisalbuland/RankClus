I don't know if you're looking for answers or just venting. But, I'll respond. First, I don't consider you a coward for not joining for the reasons you listed. I can't imagine, the helpless feeling you must have had. We ahve all been scared in our lives, especially growing up. Secondly, you don't mention if you still have the stuttering problem or how old you are. Are you at an age, you can still enlist? While you are right, you would have been picked on a little in boot camp,(some people just don't grow up as quickkly), I think th eexperience would also, have built you up and given you more self confidence. If you're still at a decent age, think about going in either as enlisted or taking a commission. Talk to a recruiter. Thanks for sharing.",

I don't know if you're looking for answers or just venting. But, I'll respond. First, I don't consider you a coward for not joining for the reasons you listed. I can't imagine, the helpless feeling you must have had. We ahve all been scared in our lives, especially growing up. Secondly, you don't mention if you still have the stuttering problem or how old you are. Are you at an age, you can still enlist? While you are right, you would have been picked on a little in boot camp,(some people just don't grow up as quickkly), I think th eexperience would also, have built you up and given you more self confidence. If you're still at a decent age, think about going in either as enlisted or taking a commission. Talk to a recruiter. Thanks for sharing.",
