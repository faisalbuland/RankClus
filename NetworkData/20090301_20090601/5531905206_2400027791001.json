Just don't call the piano player a S.O.B. even if the S.O.B. can't play the piano. Or something to that effect. Never the less I LIKE IT. You are right on the money. Never go after the poster and you will stay out of trouble here. Anytime a thread goes to name calling of the posters the thread is done. Some come back from it but seldom do. Debate is a good thing and I love it as much as the next person. Thank you for your post. MD",
