Miker, Given what you've written here, it's entirely possible you'll be boarded out. You STILL have the condition that is causing you the pain, the stim only \"short circuits\" it. Plus the fact that strenuous activty CAN dislodge the electodes, it doesn't bode well. Good Luck, however.",

The surgery, done arthroscopically, left about a 2 inch scar in the small of my back, required no bolts, screws or plates, and has completely free me of pain in that region, while restoring all use of my legs - - I remained 100% in the military, taking on not less, but more of a load.

Being assigned/attached to a WTU is NOT a one-way ticket out. The idea of a WTU is to allow Soldiers to concentrate on healing and recovering maximum function. Being at maximum possible function can mean returning to duty (same MOS), MEB, PEB or MMRB for reclass. If you are having difficulty performing your job, and if you are having difficulty making medical appointments because of job requirements (or interference), then you might want to look into the WTU as an option that can give you a really good shot at staying in.",

I was fine for awhile, but a few years later it started agrivating me. It got to the point where I was unable to do daily PT. I was waived from that but still had to perform the biannual PT Test. I progressively became slower and slower, but still not failing. Even then there was one doc that tried to get me Med Boarded. I was REAL lucky that I had 18 1/2 years in at the time he tried this. I was able to retire with my 20, but had to fight for it. I can't tell you what will happen to you as each case is different, but good luck. George P.S. - You may have already asked (and probably don't want to hear this) but have you asked the dreaded question of what your condition would be if they were removed. I know, I know, not what you want to hear. Just a question though...which is more important to you right now, the twins or your career...food for thought.",

        "reply": "Miker, Sorry to hear about your condition. I had a compression fracture to L3 vertebrae while in. I was down for 6 weeks. I was fine for awhile, but a few years later it started agrivating me. It got to the point where I was unable to do daily PT. I was waived from that but still had to perform the biannual PT Test. I progressively became slower and slower, but still not failing. Even then there was one doc that tried to get me Med Boarded. I was REAL lucky that I had 18 1/2 years in at the time he tried this. I was able to retire with my 20, but had to fight for it. I can't tell you what will happen to you as each case is different, but good luck. George P.S. - You may have already asked (and probably don't want to hear this) but have you asked the dreaded question of what your condition would be if they were removed. I know, I know, not what you want to hear. Just a question though...which is more important to you right now, the twins or your career...food for thought.",

The physician has to write a memo, the Company Commander has to complete a functional assessment, plus some other assorted paperwork, then it's all sent for review and possible assignment/attachment to a WTU near you. Being assigned/attached to a WTU is NOT a one-way ticket out. The idea of a WTU is to allow Soldiers to concentrate on healing and recovering maximum function. Being at maximum possible function can mean returning to duty (same MOS), MEB, PEB or MMRB for reclass. If you are having difficulty performing your job, and if you are having difficulty making medical appointments because of job requirements (or interference), then you might want to look into the WTU as an option that can give you a really good shot at staying in.",
