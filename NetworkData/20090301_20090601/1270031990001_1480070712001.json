I don't think I \"typed wrong\" but I may have typed in a way that seemed impolite.

Now, once again, dogmatism have slowed human progress, if only on a minor scale among my friends in that group. I can't tell you how angry I am about it. So, before you belittle atheism with your self-righteous rhetoric and set it aside as just another world view, consider what it is that you portend with your small, selfish, dogmatic ways.

Atheists are just people... Exactly. I was recently wondering why the two categories I usually frequent at Military-dot-com are \"Religion in the Military\" and \"Gay/Lesbian Issues in the Military.\" I concluded that the reason was that I truly believe that gays and atheists are the two largest remaining groups in America against whom discrimination is still tolerated. Members of both groups frequently find themselves in situations where acknowledging such \"membership\" is socially unaccepted or awkward. Those in the majority still deliver jokes about gays, and rabid-anti-communist-style rants against atheists, with relative impunity. No other ethnic, racial, social or religious groups are so easily targeted for social scorn. Gays are making much more progress than atheists at the moment, but they still are not treated as completely equal citizens. There is, however, at least one openly gay member of Congress; I'm not aware of any openly non-believing person there. Many people seem to think \"freedom of religion\" means freedom to choose from among the available religions, as long as one IS chosen. They fail to comprehend that it also means we are free to choose NO religion for ourselves. The very fact that we are labeled as ATHEISTS illustrates that our lack-of-belief is so far outside the mainstream, we must be described in terms of what we DON'T believe. By comparison, when was the last time you heard of a Shintoist being described as an A-Yahweh-ist, or a Muslim described as an A-Shiva-ist? For that matter, why aren't ALL people described as A-Unicorn-ists, since we are all presumably united in a lack of belief in those creatures? The thing that's most amazing to me is the fact that available evidence (or lack thereof) supports OUR view. There is no evidence of any deity's existence, at least none that meets accepted criteria for \"evidence.\" Anything that \"Theist A\" claims as evidence of Deity A's existence can just as easily be claimed as evidence for the existence of Deity B through Z, and thousands more. If something can be claimed as evidence for that many opposing theories, then it is useless as evidence. This leaves us with the observable universe and the laws we can deduce about it, which is what the rationalist attempts to do. Since we see no evidence of something, we don't assume it exists. So why is it that the people who are taking the most rational, objective viewpoint of the universe are described in terms of NOT doing the opposite? When I hear the term \"atheist\" applied to myself or others (even though I myself have done so for the sake of expediency), I get the same feeling that I would if we were routinely but constantly described as \"not insane.\"",

Now, once again, dogmatism have slowed human progress, if only on a minor scale among my friends in that group. I can't tell you how angry I am about it.

Atheists are just people... Exactly. I was recently wondering why the two categories I usually frequent at Military-dot-com are \"Religion in the Military\" and \"Gay/Lesbian Issues in the Military.\" I concluded that the reason was that I truly believe that gays and atheists are the two largest remaining groups in America against whom discrimination is still tolerated. Members of both groups frequently find themselves in situations where acknowledging such \"membership\" is socially unaccepted or awkward. Those in the majority still deliver jokes about gays, and rabid-anti-communist-style rants against atheists, with relative impunity. No other ethnic, racial, social or religious groups are so easily targeted for social scorn. Gays are making much more progress than atheists at the moment, but they still are not treated as completely equal citizens. There is, however, at least one openly gay member of Congress; I'm not aware of any openly non-believing person there. Many people seem to think \"freedom of religion\" means freedom to choose from among the available religions, as long as one IS chosen. They fail to comprehend that it also means we are free to choose NO religion for ourselves. The very fact that we are labeled as ATHEISTS illustrates that our lack-of-belief is so far outside the mainstream, we must be described in terms of what we DON'T believe. By comparison, when was the last time you heard of a Shintoist being described as an A-Yahweh-ist, or a Muslim described as an A-Shiva-ist? For that matter, why aren't ALL people described as A-Unicorn-ists, since we are all presumably united in a lack of belief in those creatures? The thing that's most amazing to me is the fact that available evidence (or lack thereof) supports OUR view. There is no evidence of any deity's existence, at least none that meets accepted criteria for \"evidence.\" Anything that \"Theist A\" claims as evidence of Deity A's existence can just as easily be claimed as evidence for the existence of Deity B through Z, and thousands more. If something can be claimed as evidence for that many opposing theories, then it is useless as evidence. This leaves us with the observable universe and the laws we can deduce about it, which is what the rationalist attempts to do. Since we see no evidence of something, we don't assume it exists. So why is it that the people who are taking the most rational, objective viewpoint of the universe are described in terms of NOT doing the opposite? When I hear the term \"atheist\" applied to myself or others (even though I myself have done so for the sake of expediency), I get the same feeling that I would if we were routinely but constantly described as \"not insane.\"",

The very fact that we are labeled as ATHEISTS illustrates that our lack-of-belief is so far outside the mainstream, we must be described in terms of what we DON'T believe. By comparison, when was the last time you heard of a Shintoist being described as an A-Yahweh-ist, or a Muslim described as an A-Shiva-ist? For that matter, why aren't ALL people described as A-Unicorn-ists, since we are all presumably united in a lack of belief in those creatures? The thing that's most amazing to me is the fact that available evidence (or lack thereof) supports OUR view. There is no evidence of any deity's existence, at least none that meets accepted criteria for \"evidence.\" Anything that \"Theist A\" claims as evidence of Deity A's existence can just as easily be claimed as evidence for the existence of Deity B through Z, and thousands more. If something can be claimed as evidence for that many opposing theories, then it is useless as evidence. This leaves us with the observable universe and the laws we can deduce about it, which is what the rationalist attempts to do. Since we see no evidence of something, we don't assume it exists. So why is it that the people who are taking the most rational, objective viewpoint of the universe are described in terms of NOT doing the opposite? When I hear the term \"atheist\" applied to myself or others (even though I myself have done so for the sake of expediency), I get the same feeling that I would if we were routinely but constantly described as \"not insane.\"",

I was recently wondering why the two categories I usually frequent at Military-dot-com are \"Religion in the Military\" and \"Gay/Lesbian Issues in the Military.\" I concluded that the reason was that I truly believe that gays and atheists are the two largest remaining groups in America against whom discrimination is still tolerated. Members of both groups frequently find themselves in situations where acknowledging such \"membership\" is socially unaccepted or awkward. Those in the majority still deliver jokes about gays, and rabid-anti-communist-style rants against atheists, with relative impunity. No other ethnic, racial, social or religious groups are so easily targeted for social scorn. Gays are making much more progress than atheists at the moment, but they still are not treated as completely equal citizens. There is, however, at least one openly gay member of Congress; I'm not aware of any openly non-believing person there. Many people seem to think \"freedom of religion\" means freedom to choose from among the available religions, as long as one IS chosen. They fail to comprehend that it also means we are free to choose NO religion for ourselves. The very fact that we are labeled as ATHEISTS illustrates that our lack-of-belief is so far outside the mainstream, we must be described in terms of what we DON'T believe. By comparison, when was the last time you heard of a Shintoist being described as an A-Yahweh-ist, or a Muslim described as an A-Shiva-ist? For that matter, why aren't ALL people described as A-Unicorn-ists, since we are all presumably united in a lack of belief in those creatures? The thing that's most amazing to me is the fact that available evidence (or lack thereof) supports OUR view. There is no evidence of any deity's existence, at least none that meets accepted criteria for \"evidence.\" Anything that \"Theist A\" claims as evidence of Deity A's existence can just as easily be claimed as evidence for the existence of Deity B through Z, and thousands more. If something can be claimed as evidence for that many opposing theories, then it is useless as evidence. This leaves us with the observable universe and the laws we can deduce about it, which is what the rationalist attempts to do. Since we see no evidence of something, we don't assume it exists. So why is it that the people who are taking the most rational, objective viewpoint of the universe are described in terms of NOT doing the opposite? When I hear the term \"atheist\" applied to myself or others (even though I myself have done so for the sake of expediency), I get the same feeling that I would if we were routinely but constantly described as \"not insane.\"",

I don't think I \"typed wrong\" but I may have typed in a way that seemed impolite. I was still smarting from the action I had to take after spending so much time and energy to make a place that a disparate group of atheists could work together. Spending time on that group after having spent so much time on a mixed group where there was a large contingent of Christians, it was amazing to see the humanistic beauty of the work that developed in the contributors. Religious dogma creates such blinders to the human spirit: look at the busting out of the dark ages during the Renaissance, especially (milli)Quattrocentro and (milli)Cinquecentro--the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century--when humanism was allowed to flourish. Inventiveness, perspective, chiaroscuro, significant metallurgy, an understanding of the human form (in art and medicine), prescient-motion poses, corporeality, new integrated systems for architecture, programs and discoveries in shipping, and a thousand other leaps ahead in improving the human condition occurred until again and again dogmatic Christians created periods of dark ages. Now, once again, dogmatism have slowed human progress, if only on a minor scale among my friends in that group. I can't tell you how angry I am about it. So, before you belittle atheism with your self-righteous rhetoric and set it aside as just another world view, consider what it is that you portend with your small, selfish, dogmatic ways. Atheism is not the opposite side of your coin. Other dogma is the opposite side of your coin. Atheism stands alone, and if I may borrow a phrase from the afflicted, it stands in the light--of reason, that is.",

Members of both groups frequently find themselves in situations where acknowledging such \"membership\" is socially unaccepted or awkward.

Many people seem to think \"freedom of religion\" means freedom to choose from among the available religions, as long as one IS chosen. They fail to comprehend that it also means we are free to choose NO religion for ourselves.

For that matter, why aren't ALL people described as A-Unicorn-ists, since we are all presumably united in a lack of belief in those creatures? The thing that's most amazing to me is the fact that available evidence (or lack thereof) supports OUR view. There is no evidence of any deity's existence, at least none that meets accepted criteria for \"evidence.\" Anything that \"Theist A\" claims as evidence of Deity A's existence can just as easily be claimed as evidence for the existence of Deity B through Z, and thousands more. If something can be claimed as evidence for that many opposing theories, then it is useless as evidence. This leaves us with the observable universe and the laws we can deduce about it, which is what the rationalist attempts to do. Since we see no evidence of something, we don't assume it exists. So why is it that the people who are taking the most rational, objective viewpoint of the universe are described in terms of NOT doing the opposite?

This leaves us with the observable universe and the laws we can deduce about it, which is what the rationalist attempts to do. Since we see no evidence of something, we don't assume it exists. Yet you do assume it does not exist, because you haven't seen evidence. In that sense, I'd say agnostics are the rationalists - they seem to say they cannot know because no one can see all the possible evidence. quote: So why is it that the people who are taking the most rational, objective viewpoint of the universe are described in terms of NOT doing the opposite? When I hear the term \"atheist\" applied to myself or others (even though I myself have done so for the sake of expediency), I get the same feeling that I would if we were routinely but constantly described as \"not insane.\" You're on a forum about religion, talking about how you do not believe in any deity. I'd say the term is fitting.",
