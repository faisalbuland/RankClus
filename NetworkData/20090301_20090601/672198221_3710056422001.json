They failed, although the clue is quite obvious. Since the start of the sexual revolution women of the developed world took to wearing revealing clothes, while Oriental women still wear gowns and yashmaks, said Leonid Kitaev-Smyk, the senior research officer of the Russian Research Institute of Culturology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

So there is much lust, but little satisfaction. What does it have to do with the disease? We can draw an analogy with the fauna. If a male is weak, a female will see it and reject the male. This male cannot win a female, for there is a defensive mechanism in nature \u2013 this male suffers from prostatitis and impotency.

So there is much lust, but little satisfaction. What does it have to do with the disease? We can draw an analogy with the fauna. If a male is weak, a female will see it and reject the male. This male cannot win a female, for there is a defensive mechanism in nature \u2013 this male suffers from prostatitis and impotency. Nowadays, 70 percent of impotency is a natural defensive reaction to stresses caused by constant unsatisfied arousal. But this reaction is rather long-standing. Oh the horror! Dave",

This male cannot win a female, for there is a defensive mechanism in nature \u2013 this male suffers from prostatitis and impotency. Nowadays, 70 percent of impotency is a natural defensive reaction to stresses caused by constant unsatisfied arousal. But this reaction is rather long-standing. Oh the horror! Dave Oh the horror!

True, the situation has been well prepared on and off for the past century, especially the past twenty years. The initial testing grounds was conducted upon our Holy Russia and a bloody test it was. But we Russians would not just roll over and give up our freedoms and our souls, no matter how much money Wall Street poured into the fists of the Marxists. Those lessons were taken and used to properly prepare the American populace for the surrender of their freedoms and souls, to the whims of their elites and betters. First, the population was dumbed down through a politicized and substandard education system based on pop culture, rather then the classics. Americans know more about their favorite TV dramas then the drama in DC that directly affects their lives. They care more for their \"right\" to choke down a McDonalds burger or a BurgerKing burger than for their constitutional rights. Then they turn around and lecture us about our rights and about our \"democracy\". Pride blind the foolish.

So there is much lust, but little satisfaction. What does it have to do with the disease? We can draw an analogy with the fauna. If a male is weak, a female will see it and reject the male. This male cannot win a female, for there is a defensive mechanism in nature \u2013 this male suffers from prostatitis and impotency. Nowadays, 70 percent of impotency is a natural defensive reaction to stresses caused by constant unsatisfied arousal. But this reaction is rather long-standing. Oh the horror! Dave",
