The vessel will patrol the South China Sea.(Xinhua Photo) China's largest fishery administration vessel began patrolling the South China Sea Tuesday afternoon. \"China Yuzheng 311\" will patrol the Xisha Islands such as Zhaoshu, Yongxing and the East Island to give Chinese fishermen in this area more powerful protection for their interests and safety, said Liu Guimao with the Administration of Fishery and Fishing Harbor Supervision for the South China Sea. \"Despite hot weather of nearly 30 degrees Celsius, the 311 crew was in good spirits and confident with their tasks,\" Liu told Xinhua. \"China Yuzheng 311\" made a week-long voyage to the region from its home port in Guangzhou before arriving Tuesday noon. The vessel stopped at a naval base in Sanya in the southern Hainan Province last Thursday for supplies and set sail for the islands, which are about 180 nautical miles southeast of Hainan. However, the vessel encountered a storm which delayed its arrival in the islands which was expected to be on Sunday, the vessel's captain, who preferred not to be named, told Xinhua. With 112.68 meters in length, 15 meters in width, and a maximum displacement of 4,600 tonnes, the vessel is the largest of its kind in China. Equipped with the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS), an advanced communication system initiated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), \"China Yuzheng 311\" can sail non-stop for 8,000 sea miles at a maximum speed of 22 knots.

At least six patrol vessels belonging to provincial units of the Maritime Safety Bureau of China have been sent to the South China Sea in recent weeks, with several others being prepared for departure, China Daily reported. Some of the busiest international shipping lanes cut through the South China Sea, which is home to the disputed Spratly and Paracel islands that are valued for potentially vast mineral and oil deposits. China announced last month it had sent one civilian patrol vessel to waters around the Spratlys, drawing concern from the Philippines, one of the nations claiming sovereignty over the area. Recently renewed claims by nations over parts of the Spratlys were one reason for China stepping up its presence in the area, China Daily reported. The increased patrols also come after a near collision last month between Chinese boats and a US naval surveillance ship in international waters within China\u2019s exclusive economic zone off Hainan island. (...) Zhou said a United Nations effort this year to chart maritime territory had led to a rise in tensions, as nations hurry to submit claims and other legal documentation to the international body.
