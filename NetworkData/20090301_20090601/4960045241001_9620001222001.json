It maintains a thought, emotion or attitude in the brain. Eg. the right rear zone of the brain might contain a stored thought like \u201cI obey to [name]\" or even \"I'm not brainwashed\". How to free oneself of this influence: it consists of sustaining the opposite thought at the same location of the brain, without using any words. Eg. instead of \u201cI obey to [name]\" think \"I don't obey to [name]\". Thought can be electromagnetically instaured in bodies. Here the same technique applies. If the method above should not result in the disappearance of thoughts, projecting might help: i.e. the intent to vanish the internalized thought.",
