This veteran say's the good Colonel was justified in his being outraged over what a few undisciplined criminals wearing US Marine uniforms did at Haditha. Please. He shot off his big fat mouth before he had fact one. And after the facts were all in and the case adjudicated, what did he do/say? Face the facts, you don't like him because he was one of the first congressmen/veterans, not only that the Marine war vet was a Democrat, who spoke out against the war in Iraq.
