High-speed rail will get an $8-billion shot in the arm from the stimulus package. The secretary of Transportation is drawing up guidelines for how the money will be spent and communities are dusting off ideas and going after a share of the funds, which will be doled out through 2012. Plans for high-speed rail projects have languished for years for lack of funding. But as highways and airways have clogged with congestion, interest in high-speed train travel has increased. It's a top priority for President Obama, who pressed to have significant funding included in the stimulus bill. The president also plans to press for additional funding in regular budget bills so that the U.S. eventually can have high-speed trains like the ones in Japan and Europe. But few of the projects that are now contemplated will travel as fast as those overseas. While those trains move at speeds closer to 200 miles per hour (mph), the average speed of trains in the U.S. now is about 80 mph. The goal of most U.S. projects is to get up to speeds of 110 mph or so. \"Call it higher-speed rail, rather than high-speed rail,\" says Rick Harnish of the Midwest High Speed Rail Association. Projects that are farthest along and well positioned to be tapped include: \u2022Chicago to St. Louis. Construction would start this year and take at least two years to complete. Currently the trip takes up to six hours. The goal is to reduce that time to three hours 45 minutes and increase frequency from five times a day to nine. Trains would go 110 mph instead of 79 mph. \u2022Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison Wis. The basic design work is done. The project would expand train service from seven to 10 times a day from Chicago to Milwaukee and extend train service to Madison, which currently does not have service. \u2022The \"3-C Corridor.\" This would link Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, following the same path as highway Route 71. \u2022California. An 800-mile system would link the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California and the cities in between. These would be true bullet trains, with speeds of up to 200 mph. Last November, Californians approved nearly $10 billion in bonds to get going on the project. The surveying is done, and some contracts have already been signed. \u2022Tucson, Ariz., to Phoenix. The service would operate trains at speeds up to 125 mph with as many as 15 stations. The project involves new track, upgrading old tracks and improving highway-rail grade crossings. There is no daily, punctual rail service in this corridor today. \u2022Charlotte, N.C. to Washington, D.C. Environmental and engineering studies have been done. The project could be completed by 2015. There are future plans to extend the route into South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is one other project worth mentioning, simply because of the publicity it has received: Shortly after the stimulus was passed, some news outlets suggested the high-speed rail money was added to help Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada get funding for a controversial proposal to build a magnetic-levitation rail line between Las Vegas and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. While the project would be eligible for such funding, it is not among those that seem likely to win the competition for the limited funds available.",

While the project would be eligible for such funding, it is not among those that seem likely to win the competition for the limited funds available.",

I travel a lot and generally drive simply because the trains don't run to where I'm going and flying is too expensive, especially when you factor in a rental car at the other end.

Europe is very compact and heavily populated. The United States is continental in size and we're only packed into certain areas, such as the northeast, west coast and front range area of Colorado. High speed rails outside those areas will probably lose money. And, on the subject of intra-city rail, the success of that too is determined by density and availability of right of way. For instance, it works well in NYC and Chicago because the metro areas are small in comparison with western metro areas and the right of way for the trains was bought years ago when it was farmland. Compare that with Dallas now. Dallas has some very limited light rail, but it doesn't go where the people are or where they need to go simply because they are restricted to using abandonded railroad right of ways. That's not a legal restriction, just a fact of life after 100 years of development. To obtain rights of way now, in order to take trains to where the people are, would require major destruction of homes, businesses and roads. Not only would it be disruptive, the cost would be overwhelming. Consequently, we may talk about expanding green rail service, but it's impractical in urban areas which don't already have trains.",

High-speed rail will get an $8-billion shot in the arm from the stimulus package. The secretary of Transportation is drawing up guidelines for how the money will be spent and communities are dusting off ideas and going after a share of the funds, which will be doled out through 2012. Plans for high-speed rail projects have languished for years for lack of funding. But as highways and airways have clogged with congestion, interest in high-speed train travel has increased. It's a top priority for President Obama, who pressed to have significant funding included in the stimulus bill. The president also plans to press for additional funding in regular budget bills so that the U.S. eventually can have high-speed trains like the ones in Japan and Europe. But few of the projects that are now contemplated will travel as fast as those overseas. While those trains move at speeds closer to 200 miles per hour (mph), the average speed of trains in the U.S. now is about 80 mph. The goal of most U.S. projects is to get up to speeds of 110 mph or so. \"Call it higher-speed rail, rather than high-speed rail,\" says Rick Harnish of the Midwest High Speed Rail Association. Projects that are farthest along and well positioned to be tapped include: \u2022Chicago to St. Louis. Construction would start this year and take at least two years to complete. Currently the trip takes up to six hours. The goal is to reduce that time to three hours 45 minutes and increase frequency from five times a day to nine. Trains would go 110 mph instead of 79 mph. \u2022Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison Wis. The basic design work is done. The project would expand train service from seven to 10 times a day from Chicago to Milwaukee and extend train service to Madison, which currently does not have service. \u2022The \"3-C Corridor.\" This would link Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, following the same path as highway Route 71. \u2022California. An 800-mile system would link the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California and the cities in between. These would be true bullet trains, with speeds of up to 200 mph.

The service would operate trains at speeds up to 125 mph with as many as 15 stations. The project involves new track, upgrading old tracks and improving highway-rail grade crossings.

The project could be completed by 2015. There are future plans to extend the route into South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is one other project worth mentioning, simply because of the publicity it has received: Shortly after the stimulus was passed, some news outlets suggested the high-speed rail money was added to help Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada get funding for a controversial proposal to build a magnetic-levitation rail line between Las Vegas and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. While the project would be eligible for such funding, it is not among those that seem likely to win the competition for the limited funds available.",

As said the rails will have to be overhauled. We are not packed in population. I could see Miami to NY. But LV to LA is a joke. I see it as a mismanaged boondoggle like the Big Dig. If it could be done right and leave all the interest groups and heavy fed hands out it might have a small chance. But the Govt will F that up too.",

I travel a lot and generally drive simply because the trains don't run to where I'm going and flying is too expensive, especially when you factor in a rental car at the other end. However, high speed rail will only work where the population density is enough to warrant it. It's unfair to compare Europe's rail system with ours for that very reason. Europe is very compact and heavily populated. The United States is continental in size and we're only packed into certain areas, such as the northeast, west coast and front range area of Colorado. High speed rails outside those areas will probably lose money. And, on the subject of intra-city rail, the success of that too is determined by density and availability of right of way. For instance, it works well in NYC and Chicago because the metro areas are small in comparison with western metro areas and the right of way for the trains was bought years ago when it was farmland. Compare that with Dallas now. Dallas has some very limited light rail, but it doesn't go where the people are or where they need to go simply because they are restricted to using abandonded railroad right of ways. That's not a legal restriction, just a fact of life after 100 years of development. To obtain rights of way now, in order to take trains to where the people are, would require major destruction of homes, businesses and roads. Not only would it be disruptive, the cost would be overwhelming. Consequently, we may talk about expanding green rail service, but it's impractical in urban areas which don't already have trains.",

If the State grabs BNSFRR right-of-way through eminent domain proceedings the economy of California will not exactly collapse. Worse, the cost of shipping goods will skyrocket with perishables such as food becoming obscenely expensive.
