Some of these people were trying to do this on Craig's List late last year when I was looking to move. The ad had pictures of the inside and the outside of the property, and the ad was written in proper English (at least it read like it was written by an American), and the address, but something wasn't right. The rental price being asked for a property in the area I wanted seemed too low for the house, so I inquired, just to see what would happen. The reply back used a completely different grammar pattern - clearly written by a foreigner. The person said he was moving out of country and wanted a money order. At that point, I knew it was a scam, but wanted to see how far it would go. So, I demanded to see the property before I rented it. The person said he couldn't meet me there. So I asked how I was supposed to get the keys, and how he could insure that the property had been inspected, maintained, and was up to code for renting. I asked him if he'd registered his rental property with the county. I asked for his phone number. I received one more \"tap-dancing\" e-mail from him, at which point I sent back a very short e-mail, calling him a scammer, telling him that I'd found the original ad for the property listed by the real owners, and told him to screw himself. But yeah, they're doing this in several locations. The only thing individuals can do is to post \"watch out for these scams!\" ads on Craig's List, and hope that potential renters read the warnings. Oh, and harassing the scammers can be fun, too. Use an e-mail address not connected to anything useful.",

Uh, NOOOOO thanks! Well come to find out the name he introduced himself with was a totally different name (and gender!) than the name on the address that was emailing me about the house when I inquired.
