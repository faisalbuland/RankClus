Can any of you tell me how you keep your Christian values when you are a round people that don't care what they do. Character and the memory of who you represent. You have the ability in everything you do in action and word to show His love. I use a very strong Pastor group I meet with twice a week to stay re-charged in what I do. We have 3-70+ year old retired Rev's, 3-40+ year old active Ministers, and 4-30 & 40+ yr old active Chaplains, DOD-Fire & Police-VA-Hospice, as regular attendee's. We share our problems and counsel among ourselves. I find this helps me beyond words. I, like you, find myself in difficult situations during the week among people who honestly do not care about anything, except maybe immediate gratification. I remember who I am, and try to help when they'll listen. I finally have reached the age that I don't need to fit in. I am not willing to jeapordize my standing, beliefs, and character. I do the best I can to be Spirit led in all I do, and help others regardless of their beliefs, life styles or stature. At times I too, find this extremely difficult. Nobody ever said it would be easy, but it does show that it cost those before us, everything! The reward as promised, is later... Hope that helps some... CJ PS... If you believe in Christ you are a Saint. Saint means believer in Christ.",

I try, as best as it is humanly possible, to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ as recorded in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

The hardest time I have following Christian values are when I am around people whose \"Christian values\" include large amounts of dogma and doctrine not based on the teachings of Jesus Christ (i.e. You must always vote for the Republican candidate; you must discriminate against gays, women or non-Caucasians; you must never question any statements made by Popes, televangelists (Pat Robertson), dentists masquarading as historians (David Barton) or child psychologists (James Dobson); you must believe that the United States is, was and always will be an evangelical, fundamentalist, Protestant \"Christian nation\" and you must work to codify that belief into civil and criminal law, you must hate all Muslims, etc.). It isn't easy to practice Christian values - especially when around \"Christians\" Just concentrate on his teachings, such as these from Matthew: Chapter 19 Verses 17-19 quote: \"But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.\" He said to Him, \u201cWhich ones?\u201d Jesus said, \u201cYou shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d",

At first we see others doing things that we know are wrong or perhaps even self destructive, but also know that to voice our opinion would be futile or destructive, to all concerned. After a while we begin to feel \"what's the point? Everybody else is doing it why shouldn't I?\" That IS the POINT!! We know better!! It ain't easy, but then again, nobody ever said it was!! It's hard to perhaps remember a youth when we tried things that felt great, but hurt us in some small way, or even a great deal....or hurt someone we cared about a great deal. And not want to feel \"good\"again. But, was it really \"good\" that we felt?? Maybe destroyed a relationship. Or in the case of all the friends I had as I has growing up, killed them one after another. By the time I was 41 they were ALL dead. My wife's sister died at 48 in Jan 2007 from meth addiction and you and so many others can look back and see many of the same examples. So when we are trying to keep to the straight and narrow it's hard enough to stick it out, don't feel bad you sometimes wonder why you do. We all get a little shaky now and then, but then we just soldier on as best we can, one step at a time. When we fall on our faces, or azzes, well, we pick our selves up, dust ourselves off or if we're REALLY lucky, somebody who loves us dusts us off and shoves our sorry selves out the door to try again......we gotta keep tryin' big guy.

The thing is, according to the posts in this forum, most Americans are religious, and claim to be christians. So that means that cart I stopped before it could damage a stranger's car was probably left by someone who professes to be a christian. Someone who had absolutely no regard for, or who was at least indifferent to his fellow man. If, as claimed in these forums, most of my fellow Americans are religious, that means the guy who cuts me off in traffic, the woman who throws her trash on the ground, the people who speak foul language without regard to who is around to hear them, the ones who cheat on their taxes, or drive while drunk, who abuse their children, or cheat on their spouses...most of these are religious people and quite possibly christians.

The golden rule, \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", is an excellent philosophy for anyone to live by, regardless of whether or not you believe in a supreme being. It would mean that at work, everyone would give the kind of service they would like to have for themselves. It would mean your neighbor would grab your trash can before it rolled into the street simply because he'd like you to do the same for him. It would mean the kid across the street would run over to help your wife carry in the groceries, simply because she could use a hand. And wouldn't it be a better world if everyone focused on what was necessary for a good community, rather than on what things might win them a place in heaven after they died? I don't worry much about what happens when I die.

If, as claimed in these forums, most of my fellow Americans are religious, that means the guy who cuts me off in traffic, the woman who throws her trash on the ground, the people who speak foul language without regard to who is around to hear them, the ones who cheat on their taxes, or drive while drunk, who abuse their children, or cheat on their spouses...most of these are religious people and quite possibly christians. If they consider that behavior appropriate for followers of a religious faith, I'd like them all to give it up!

I do so because it's the right thing to do, and I would like anyone else to do the same for me. The thing is, according to the posts in this forum, most Americans are religious, and claim to be christians. So that means that cart I stopped before it could damage a stranger's car was probably left by someone who professes to be a christian. Someone who had absolutely no regard for, or who was at least indifferent to his fellow man. If, as claimed in these forums, most of my fellow Americans are religious, that means the guy who cuts me off in traffic, the woman who throws her trash on the ground, the people who speak foul language without regard to who is around to hear them, the ones who cheat on their taxes, or drive while drunk, who abuse their children, or cheat on their spouses...most of these are religious people and quite possibly christians. If they consider that behavior appropriate for followers of a religious faith, I'd like them all to give it up!

So, instead of worrying about whether you are living your life in accordance with your beliefs, live your life as a responsible member of society...because it is the right thing to do. When you think about it, the \"ten commandments\" are the kind of rules that any society would have to follow in order to survive and thrive. The golden rule, \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", is an excellent philosophy for anyone to live by, regardless of whether or not you believe in a supreme being.

It would mean your neighbor would grab your trash can before it rolled into the street simply because he'd like you to do the same for him. It would mean the kid across the street would run over to help your wife carry in the groceries, simply because she could use a hand. And wouldn't it be a better world if everyone focused on what was necessary for a good community, rather than on what things might win them a place in heaven after they died? I don't worry much about what happens when I die.

        "content": "Maine dog; What is hard, is not keeping your Christian morals. It is keeping your perspective about those morals. At first we see others doing things that we know are wrong or perhaps even self destructive, but also know that to voice our opinion would be futile or destructive, to all concerned. After a while we begin to feel \"what's the point? Everybody else is doing it why shouldn't I?\" That IS the POINT!! We know better!! It ain't easy, but then again, nobody ever said it was!! It's hard to perhaps remember a youth when we tried things that felt great, but hurt us in some small way, or even a great deal....or hurt someone we cared about a great deal. And not want to feel \"good\"again. But, was it really \"good\" that we felt?? Maybe destroyed a relationship. Or in the case of all the friends I had as I has growing up, killed them one after another. By the time I was 41 they were ALL dead. My wife's sister died at 48 in Jan 2007 from meth addiction and you and so many others can look back and see many of the same examples. So when we are trying to keep to the straight and narrow it's hard enough to stick it out, don't feel bad you sometimes wonder why you do. We all get a little shaky now and then, but then we just soldier on as best we can, one step at a time. When we fall on our faces, or azzes, well, we pick our selves up, dust ourselves off or if we're REALLY lucky, somebody who loves us dusts us off and shoves our sorry selves out the door to try again......we gotta keep tryin' big guy. Just remember, when it's all done, it's a WIN if you got up one more time than you fell down!!! T",

        "reply": "Maine dog; What is hard, is not keeping your Christian morals. It is keeping your perspective about those morals. At first we see others doing things that we know are wrong or perhaps even self destructive, but also know that to voice our opinion would be futile or destructive, to all concerned. After a while we begin to feel \"what's the point? Everybody else is doing it why shouldn't I?\" That IS the POINT!! We know better!! It ain't easy, but then again, nobody ever said it was!! It's hard to perhaps remember a youth when we tried things that felt great, but hurt us in some small way, or even a great deal....or hurt someone we cared about a great deal. And not want to feel \"good\"again. But, was it really \"good\" that we felt?? Maybe destroyed a relationship. Or in the case of all the friends I had as I has growing up, killed them one after another. By the time I was 41 they were ALL dead. My wife's sister died at 48 in Jan 2007 from meth addiction and you and so many others can look back and see many of the same examples. So when we are trying to keep to the straight and narrow it's hard enough to stick it out, don't feel bad you sometimes wonder why you do.

If, as claimed in these forums, most of my fellow Americans are religious, that means the guy who cuts me off in traffic, the woman who throws her trash on the ground, the people who speak foul language without regard to who is around to hear them, the ones who cheat on their taxes, or drive while drunk, who abuse their children, or cheat on their spouses...most of these are religious people and quite possibly christians.

It would mean the kid across the street would run over to help your wife carry in the groceries, simply because she could use a hand. And wouldn't it be a better world if everyone focused on what was necessary for a good community, rather than on what things might win them a place in heaven after they died?

Can any of you tell me how you keep your Christian values when you are around people that don't care what they do. I try, as best as it is humanly possible, to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ as recorded in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Those teachings are the only \"Christian values\" you need to follow, in my opinion as a Christian. The hardest time I have following Christian values are when I am around people whose \"Christian values\" include large amounts of dogma and doctrine not based on the teachings of Jesus Christ (i.e. You must always vote for the Republican candidate; you must discriminate against gays, women or non-Caucasians; you must never question any statements made by Popes, televangelists (Pat Robertson), dentists masquarading as historians (David Barton) or child psychologists (James Dobson); you must believe that the United States is, was and always will be an evangelical, fundamentalist, Protestant \"Christian nation\" and you must work to codify that belief into civil and criminal law, you must hate all Muslims, etc.). It isn't easy to practice Christian values - especially when around \"Christians\" Just concentrate on his teachings, such as these from Matthew: Chapter 19 Verses 17-19 quote: \"But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.\" He said to Him, \u201cWhich ones?\u201d Jesus said, \u201cYou shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d",

You have the ability in everything you do in action and word to show His love. I use a very strong Pastor group I meet with twice a week to stay re-charged in what I do. We have 3-70+ year old retired Rev's, 3-40+ year old active Ministers, and 4-30 & 40+ yr old active Chaplains, DOD-Fire & Police-VA-Hospice, as regular attendee's. We share our problems and counsel among ourselves. I find this helps me beyond words. I, like you, find myself in difficult situations during the week among people who honestly do not care about anything, except maybe immediate gratification. I remember who I am, and try to help when they'll listen. I finally have reached the age that I don't need to fit in. I am not willing to jeapordize my standing, beliefs, and character. I do the best I can to be Spirit led in all I do, and help others regardless of their beliefs, life styles or stature. At times I too, find this extremely difficult. Nobody ever said it would be easy, but it does show that it cost those before us, everything! The reward as promised, is later... Hope that helps some... CJ PS...

It's hard to perhaps remember a youth when we tried things that felt great, but hurt us in some small way, or even a great deal....or hurt someone we cared about a great deal. And not want to feel \"good\"again. But, was it really \"good\" that we felt?? Maybe destroyed a relationship.

If I run to catch stray grocery cart before it can smash into someone's car, I don't do so because some \"god\" would expect me to. I do so because it's the right thing to do, and I would like anyone else to do the same for me. The thing is, according to the posts in this forum, most Americans are religious, and claim to be christians. So that means that cart I stopped before it could damage a stranger's car was probably left by someone who professes to be a christian. Someone who had absolutely no regard for, or who was at least indifferent to his fellow man. If, as claimed in these forums, most of my fellow Americans are religious, that means the guy who cuts me off in traffic, the woman who throws her trash on the ground, the people who speak foul language without regard to who is around to hear them, the ones who cheat on their taxes, or drive while drunk, who abuse their children, or cheat on their spouses...most of these are religious people and quite possibly christians. If they consider that behavior appropriate for followers of a religious faith, I'd like them all to give it up! (It is interesting, though, to be cut off in traffic by a car bearing the JESUS in a fish emblem.) So, instead of worrying about whether you are living your life in accordance with your beliefs, live your life as a responsible member of society...because it is the right thing to do. When you think about it, the \"ten commandments\" are the kind of rules that any society would have to follow in order to survive and thrive. The golden rule, \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", is an excellent philosophy for anyone to live by, regardless of whether or not you believe in a supreme being. It would mean that at work, everyone would give the kind of service they would like to have for themselves. It would mean your neighbor would grab your trash can before it rolled into the street simply because he'd like you to do the same for him. It would mean the kid across the street would run over to help your wife carry in the groceries, simply because she could use a hand. And wouldn't it be a better world if everyone focused on what was necessary for a good community, rather than on what things might win them a place in heaven after they died? I don't worry much about what happens when I die. But I really hope that people I interacted with remember me with fondness, and to perhaps feel that in some small way, I made a difference in their life.",

If, as claimed in these forums, most of my fellow Americans are religious, that means the guy who cuts me off in traffic, the woman who throws her trash on the ground, the people who speak foul language without regard to who is around to hear them, the ones who cheat on their taxes, or drive while drunk, who abuse their children, or cheat on their spouses...most of these are religious people and quite possibly christians. If they consider that behavior appropriate for followers of a religious faith, I'd like them all to give it up! (It is interesting, though, to be cut off in traffic by a car bearing the JESUS in a fish emblem.) So, instead of worrying about whether you are living your life in accordance with your beliefs, live your life as a responsible member of society...because it is the right thing to do. When you think about it, the \"ten commandments\" are the kind of rules that any society would have to follow in order to survive and thrive. The golden rule, \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", is an excellent philosophy for anyone to live by, regardless of whether or not you believe in a supreme being. It would mean that at work, everyone would give the kind of service they would like to have for themselves. It would mean your neighbor would grab your trash can before it rolled into the street simply because he'd like you to do the same for him. It would mean the kid across the street would run over to help your wife carry in the groceries, simply because she could use a hand. And wouldn't it be a better world if everyone focused on what was necessary for a good community, rather than on what things might win them a place in heaven after they died? I don't worry much about what happens when I die. But I really hope that people I interacted with remember me with fondness, and to perhaps feel that in some small way, I made a difference in their life.",

Good post witkol, I agree with your percentages. And you sound like a great person. You sound a lot like Jesus witko1 I will do as you say and remember you with fondness. And I pray that you have made perhaps that small \"difference in their life\" as you have made in mine. - LegionSon -",
