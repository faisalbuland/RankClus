        "content": "\"IHAWKERS'\" Thread: \"Change [...] Put on hold.\" appeared to tell a different story regarding the, \"timing,\" of such a Bill. This should be a real test of where the Administration stands. Surprising the Decromats' argument will be, \"recruiting.\" Democrats have a history of being spineless on real issues. The real issue is of, \"Equal Rights,\" of what will become a protected minority class under Federal Law, when this thing passess, or one like it. Again, sad the Democrats will attempt to hide behind, \"recruiting,\" verses the human rights of American citizens. Not to mention, in my opinion, \"Military Readiness,\" is also a weak argument in relation to this social issue relative to the necessary social change it implies. *** That said, it really becomes necessary to take a real close look at, \"H.R. 1246,\" if that is the Bill they will present, or if there are modifications, what are they, etc. (?): 1.) Unless something has changed, the subject Bill does not include the, \"T,\" in GLBT. This is an absolute human rights violation and the Democrats should be ashamed. Again, a spineless move if, \"T,\" are kicked to the political curb. 2.) The language I've highlighted in Red Bold is what I think is the other major flaw with, \"H.R. 1246.\" Probably even more sinister.

I'm talking about [...] a narrow and limited disclosure policy. I am only advocating that relevant professionals address, \"disclosure,\" in terms, of the real and perceived hostile environment(s) that exist in organizations [...]. [This is not v]iolating privacy rights[] - it's an all-voluteer force [...] They're the real professionals [...]. [...] To me, this fact infers the obvious, it is secondary to the greater good in social/organizational theory. GLBT, \"fear,\" that [...] is real, but not something from which to write Federal Policy on. It is a type of, \"fear,\" that you write Federal Policy in a way that enforces specifically, and strategically, the healthy environment to allow GLBT to overcome it.\" - The, \"EO,\" references may supersede the general language in the Bill, but I don't know for sure. It doesn't look like it. It actually looks like it prevents EO from doing its' job, \"How can you address, \"sexual orientation,\" if you're not allowed to intitiate any policies or regulations with, \"sexual orientation,\" as the basis? What it appears to do is tie the hands of EO officers by only allowing them to respond to issues. If that is the case, that is a poor knot to tie. - At a minimum, it deserves clarification. *** For further clarity. Red Bold mine: From SLDN regarding the original H.R. 1246: MILITARY READINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT (H.R. 1246) SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 provides the short title for the legislation. The \u201cMilitary Readiness Enhancement Act\u201d is the title of this legislation. Section 2. Purpose. Section 2 identifies the purpose of the legislation, which is to repeal 10 U.S.C. 654 and replace it with a new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. Section 3. Repeal of 1994 Policy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces. This section repeals the current law, 10 U.S.C. 654. Section 4. Policy of Non-Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation in the Armed Forces. (a). Establishment of Policy. This section establishes a new law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the Armed Forces. This section provides for a policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces, to be titled 10 U.S.C. 656. (a) Policy. Subsection (a) provides the new policy statement, prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination within the Armed Forces and among people seeking entry into the Armed Forces. (b) Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation. This subsection provides a non-exclusive list of what constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. For current members of the Armed Forces, this section includes within the definition of sexual orientation discrimination any personnel or administrative action taken in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. For applicants for military service, denial of accession made in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes sexual orientation discrimination. (c) Personnel and Administrative Policies and Action. This section prohibits the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating under the Navy, from establishing, implementing or applying any personnel or administrative policies, or taking an personnel or administrative action, in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. It is designed to prevent the military from re-instituting discriminatory policies once \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d is repealed. (d) Rules and Policies Regarding Conduct. This language is modeled on ENDA\u2019s Section 11 (a), \u201cConstruction: Employer Rules and Policies.\u201d It is intended to clarify that nothing in the legislation will prevent the military from continuing to regulate the conduct of its members, as long as any such regulation is written and enforced in a sexual orientation-neutral manner. (e) Re-accession of Otherwise Qualified Persons Permitted. This language provides the opportunity for persons discharged for homosexuality or homosexual conduct under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or its predecessor regulations to re-apply for entry into the Armed Forces. The \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d language makes clear that there is no absolute right of re-entry for anyone discharged under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or the predecessor regulations. For example, age and physical requirements to re-enter the military would still be applied to persons who wished to re-enter the Armed Forces under this provision. (f) Sexual Orientation. Sexual orientation is defined as \u201cheterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality, whether the orientation is real or perceived, and includes statements and consensual sexual conduct manifesting heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.\u201d This first part of this definition is fairly standard, and consistent with most state law definitions of sexual orientation. It is consistent with although broader than the only current federal statutory definition of sexual orientation, which appears in 28 U.S.C. 534, the federal hate crimes Continued on next page\u2026. reporting statute. This definition is \u201cconsensual homosexuality or heterosexuality.\u201d The second part of the definition is meant to ensure that the gap created between status and conduct through the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy will not persist beyond the policy\u2019s repeal. Military discharges based on statements of sexual orientation or conduct manifesting homosexual or bisexual orientation form the basis of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d The distinction is cemented in case law challenging the ban on constitutional grounds. Without the second part of this definition, it is possible Defense Department officials could effectively continue a policy of discriminating based on statements or conduct, versus sexual orientation per se. (2). Section 4 subsection (a)(2) provides the necessary changes to the table of contents to reflect the deletion of 10 U.S.C. 654 and the addition of 10 U.S.C. 656. (b). Conforming Amendments. Section 4 subsection (b) provides the conforming amendments required by the new legislation. (1). Subsection (b)(1) adds sexual orientation discrimination to a list of issues statutorily mandated for quadrennial surveys by the Department of Defense. (2). Subsection (b)(2) modifies the Solomon Amendment to remove the reference to 10 U.S.C. 654 and related laws. It is unclear whether the Solomon Amendment will have any relevance once the current Section 654 is repealed. However, the consequence of leaving 10 U.S.C. 983 as it is would be the possibility that certain schools might prohibit military recruiters from their campuses because of the military\u2019s new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation. (3). Subsection (b)(3) adds sexual orientation to the definition of \u201cunlawful discrimination\u201d in the code provision prohibiting retaliatory personnel actions. Section 5. Benefits. This provision makes clear that this legislation does not require the military to provide dependent benefits in violation of the Defense of Marriage Act. Section 6. No Private Cause of Action for Damages. This section makes clear that this legislation does not create a private cause of action for damages. Section 7. Regulations. This section provides the authority to issue regulations implementing this legislation and gives guidance as to the content of those regulations. (a). In General. The Secretary of Defense has 90 days following enactment of the legislation to issue Department of Defense regulations implementing the legislation, and must direct each service to revise its regulations no later than 180 days after the enactment of the legislation. Regulations which must be amended include but are not limited to: (1). All Equal Opportunity and Human Relations regulations, directives, and instructions and training guidance; (2). Personnel regulations governing involuntary discharges; (3). Victim\u2019s advocacy regulations to include sexual orientation discrimination among the forms of discrimination for which members of the Armed Forces and their families may seek assistance. This provision is intended to ensure that victims of sexual orientation-based hate violence and sexual orientation discrimination can access Victims\u2019 Advocacy programs to the same extent that other victims of prohibited discrimination and hate violence can. (b). Regulation of Conduct. This provision mandates the regulations governing service members\u2019 conduct be written and enforced without regard to sexual orientation. It is essentially a reiteration of Section 3 (c), but we think it is important that this concept appear in both the policy section and the regulation section of the legislation as a political matter. (c). Definition. This section provides reference to the new 10 USC 656(f) for the definition of sexual orientation. *** Again the highlighted line items are grey - as I explained above - to say the least and need to be clearly addressed. *** Either way, \"H.R. 1246,\" - if that is what is about to be on the table - is clearly suspect for a large number of reasons. Americans can do a lot better than that ... the GLBT community deserve better. Under Section 8 of the US Constitution, Congress can do much, much better. This message has been edited.

        "reply": "\"IHAWKERS'\" Thread: \"Change [...] Put on hold.\" appeared to tell a different story regarding the, \"timing,\" of such a Bill. This should be a real test of where the Administration stands. Surprising the Decromats' argument will be, \"recruiting.\" Democrats have a history of being spineless on real issues. The real issue is of, \"Equal Rights,\" of what will become a protected minority class under Federal Law, when this thing passess, or one like it. Again, sad the Democrats will attempt to hide behind, \"recruiting,\" verses the human rights of American citizens. Not to mention, in my opinion, \"Military Readiness,\" is also a weak argument in relation to this social issue relative to the necessary social change it implies. *** That said, it really becomes necessary to take a real close look at, \"H.R. 1246,\" if that is the Bill they will present, or if there are modifications, what are they, etc. (?): 1.) Unless something has changed, the subject Bill does not include the, \"T,\" in GLBT. This is an absolute human rights violation and the Democrats should be ashamed. Again, a spineless move if, \"T,\" are kicked to the political curb. 2.) The language I've highlighted in Red Bold is what I think is the other major flaw with, \"H.R. 1246.\" Probably even more sinister.

I'm talking about [...] a narrow and limited disclosure policy. I am only advocating that relevant professionals address, \"disclosure,\" in terms, of the real and perceived hostile environment(s) that exist in organizations [...]. [This is not v]iolating privacy rights[] - it's an all-voluteer force [...] They're the real professionals [...]. [...] To me, this fact infers the obvious, it is secondary to the greater good in social/organizational theory. GLBT, \"fear,\" that [...] is real, but not something from which to write Federal Policy on. It is a type of, \"fear,\" that you write Federal Policy in a way that enforces specifically, and strategically, the healthy environment to allow GLBT to overcome it.\" - The, \"EO,\" references may supersede the general language in the Bill, but I don't know for sure. It doesn't look like it. It actually looks like it prevents EO from doing its' job, \"How can you address, \"sexual orientation,\" if you're not allowed to intitiate any policies or regulations with, \"sexual orientation,\" as the basis? What it appears to do is tie the hands of EO officers by only allowing them to respond to issues. If that is the case, that is a poor knot to tie. - At a minimum, it deserves clarification. *** For further clarity. Red Bold mine: From SLDN regarding the original H.R. 1246: MILITARY READINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT (H.R. 1246) SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 provides the short title for the legislation. The \u201cMilitary Readiness Enhancement Act\u201d is the title of this legislation. Section 2. Purpose. Section 2 identifies the purpose of the legislation, which is to repeal 10 U.S.C. 654 and replace it with a new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. Section 3. Repeal of 1994 Policy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces. This section repeals the current law, 10 U.S.C. 654. Section 4. Policy of Non-Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation in the Armed Forces. (a). Establishment of Policy. This section establishes a new law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the Armed Forces. This section provides for a policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces, to be titled 10 U.S.C. 656. (a) Policy. Subsection (a) provides the new policy statement, prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination within the Armed Forces and among people seeking entry into the Armed Forces. (b) Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation. This subsection provides a non-exclusive list of what constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. For current members of the Armed Forces, this section includes within the definition of sexual orientation discrimination any personnel or administrative action taken in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. For applicants for military service, denial of accession made in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes sexual orientation discrimination. (c) Personnel and Administrative Policies and Action. This section prohibits the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating under the Navy, from establishing, implementing or applying any personnel or administrative policies, or taking an personnel or administrative action, in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. It is designed to prevent the military from re-instituting discriminatory policies once \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d is repealed. (d) Rules and Policies Regarding Conduct. This language is modeled on ENDA\u2019s Section 11 (a), \u201cConstruction: Employer Rules and Policies.\u201d It is intended to clarify that nothing in the legislation will prevent the military from continuing to regulate the conduct of its members, as long as any such regulation is written and enforced in a sexual orientation-neutral manner. (e) Re-accession of Otherwise Qualified Persons Permitted. This language provides the opportunity for persons discharged for homosexuality or homosexual conduct under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or its predecessor regulations to re-apply for entry into the Armed Forces. The \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d language makes clear that there is no absolute right of re-entry for anyone discharged under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or the predecessor regulations. For example, age and physical requirements to re-enter the military would still be applied to persons who wished to re-enter the Armed Forces under this provision. (f) Sexual Orientation. Sexual orientation is defined as \u201cheterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality, whether the orientation is real or perceived, and includes statements and consensual sexual conduct manifesting heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.\u201d This first part of this definition is fairly standard, and consistent with most state law definitions of sexual orientation. It is consistent with although broader than the only current federal statutory definition of sexual orientation, which appears in 28 U.S.C. 534, the federal hate crimes Continued on next page\u2026. reporting statute. This definition is \u201cconsensual homosexuality or heterosexuality.\u201d The second part of the definition is meant to ensure that the gap created between status and conduct through the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy will not persist beyond the policy\u2019s repeal. Military discharges based on statements of sexual orientation or conduct manifesting homosexual or bisexual orientation form the basis of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d The distinction is cemented in case law challenging the ban on constitutional grounds. Without the second part of this definition, it is possible Defense Department officials could effectively continue a policy of discriminating based on statements or conduct, versus sexual orientation per se. (2). Section 4 subsection (a)(2) provides the necessary changes to the table of contents to reflect the deletion of 10 U.S.C. 654 and the addition of 10 U.S.C. 656. (b). Conforming Amendments. Section 4 subsection (b) provides the conforming amendments required by the new legislation. (1). Subsection (b)(1) adds sexual orientation discrimination to a list of issues statutorily mandated for quadrennial surveys by the Department of Defense. (2). Subsection (b)(2) modifies the Solomon Amendment to remove the reference to 10 U.S.C. 654 and related laws. It is unclear whether the Solomon Amendment will have any relevance once the current Section 654 is repealed. However, the consequence of leaving 10 U.S.C. 983 as it is would be the possibility that certain schools might prohibit military recruiters from their campuses because of the military\u2019s new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation. (3). Subsection (b)(3) adds sexual orientation to the definition of \u201cunlawful discrimination\u201d in the code provision prohibiting retaliatory personnel actions. Section 5. Benefits. This provision makes clear that this legislation does not require the military to provide dependent benefits in violation of the Defense of Marriage Act. Section 6. No Private Cause of Action for Damages. This section makes clear that this legislation does not create a private cause of action for damages. Section 7. Regulations. This section provides the authority to issue regulations implementing this legislation and gives guidance as to the content of those regulations. (a). In General. The Secretary of Defense has 90 days following enactment of the legislation to issue Department of Defense regulations implementing the legislation, and must direct each service to revise its regulations no later than 180 days after the enactment of the legislation. Regulations which must be amended include but are not limited to: (1). All Equal Opportunity and Human Relations regulations, directives, and instructions and training guidance; (2). Personnel regulations governing involuntary discharges; (3). Victim\u2019s advocacy regulations to include sexual orientation discrimination among the forms of discrimination for which members of the Armed Forces and their families may seek assistance. This provision is intended to ensure that victims of sexual orientation-based hate violence and sexual orientation discrimination can access Victims\u2019 Advocacy programs to the same extent that other victims of prohibited discrimination and hate violence can. (b). Regulation of Conduct. This provision mandates the regulations governing service members\u2019 conduct be written and enforced without regard to sexual orientation. It is essentially a reiteration of Section 3 (c), but we think it is important that this concept appear in both the policy section and the regulation section of the legislation as a political matter. (c). Definition. This section provides reference to the new 10 USC 656(f) for the definition of sexual orientation. *** Again the highlighted line items are grey - as I explained above - to say the least and need to be clearly addressed. *** Either way, \"H.R. 1246,\" - if that is what is about to be on the table - is clearly suspect for a large number of reasons. Americans can do a lot better than that ... the GLBT community deserve better. Under Section 8 of the US Constitution, Congress can do much, much better. This message has been edited.

I realize, Equal, you just want to see this scheme of 'forced to divulge' ones sexual orientation fulfilled by law in order to \"protect\" GLBT folks and establish their rights to privacy at the same time. But, it's just more of BIG government herding minority members of society around. Sexual Apartheid monitoring of American citizens in uniform to avoid the possibility of someone in uniform being offended. The objective of removing DA/DT is so that patriotic qualified American's can serve their country without fear of 'special treatment' (like getting 'fired') should they reveal their sexual orientation or should they be 'found out'. They want to serve as freely as the others who have, of their own volition, also chosen to make themselves expendable so others can live in peace and safety, pursuing life, liberty and happiness. Let Congress debate it... and they will. Who was signed on or off the issue before is past. It's a new day. Let's get on with it in a democratic reasonable manner that will not intentionally stigmatize a group of patriots. What's wrong with that? Why should they have to tell anyone what their sexual preferences are in some public forum? Weird!",

        "content": "\"IHAWKERS'\" Thread: \"Change [...] Put on hold.\" appeared to tell a different story regarding the, \"timing,\" of such a Bill. This should be a real test of where the Administration stands. Surprising the Decromats' argument will be, \"recruiting.\" Democrats have a history of being spineless on real issues. The real issue is of, \"Equal Rights,\" of what will become a protected minority class under Federal Law, when this thing passess, or one like it. Again, sad the Democrats will attempt to hide behind, \"recruiting,\" verses the human rights of American citizens. Not to mention, in my opinion, \"Military Readiness,\" is also a weak argument in relation to this social issue relative to the necessary social change it implies. *** That said, it really becomes necessary to take a real close look at, \"H.R. 1246,\" if that is the Bill they will present, or if there are modifications, what are they, etc. (?): 1.) Unless something has changed, the subject Bill does not include the, \"T,\" in GLBT. This is an absolute human rights violation and the Democrats should be ashamed. Again, a spineless move if, \"T,\" are kicked to the political curb. 2.) The language I've highlighted in Red Bold is what I think is the other major flaw with, \"H.R. 1246.\" Probably even more sinister.

I'm talking about [...] a narrow and limited disclosure policy. I am only advocating that relevant professionals address, \"disclosure,\" in terms, of the real and perceived hostile environment(s) that exist in organizations [...]. [This is not v]iolating privacy rights[] - it's an all-voluteer force [...] They're the real professionals [...]. [...] To me, this fact infers the obvious, it is secondary to the greater good in social/organizational theory. GLBT, \"fear,\" that [...] is real, but not something from which to write Federal Policy on. It is a type of, \"fear,\" that you write Federal Policy in a way that enforces specifically, and strategically, the healthy environment to allow GLBT to overcome it.\" - The, \"EO,\" references may supersede the general language in the Bill, but I don't know for sure. It doesn't look like it. It actually looks like it prevents EO from doing its' job, \"How can you address, \"sexual orientation,\" if you're not allowed to intitiate any policies or regulations with, \"sexual orientation,\" as the basis? What it appears to do is tie the hands of EO officers by only allowing them to respond to issues. If that is the case, that is a poor knot to tie. - At a minimum, it deserves clarification. *** For further clarity. Red Bold mine: From SLDN regarding the original H.R. 1246: MILITARY READINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT (H.R. 1246) SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 provides the short title for the legislation. The \u201cMilitary Readiness Enhancement Act\u201d is the title of this legislation. Section 2. Purpose. Section 2 identifies the purpose of the legislation, which is to repeal 10 U.S.C. 654 and replace it with a new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. Section 3. Repeal of 1994 Policy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces. This section repeals the current law, 10 U.S.C. 654. Section 4. Policy of Non-Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation in the Armed Forces. (a). Establishment of Policy. This section establishes a new law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the Armed Forces. This section provides for a policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces, to be titled 10 U.S.C. 656. (a) Policy. Subsection (a) provides the new policy statement, prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination within the Armed Forces and among people seeking entry into the Armed Forces. (b) Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation. This subsection provides a non-exclusive list of what constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. For current members of the Armed Forces, this section includes within the definition of sexual orientation discrimination any personnel or administrative action taken in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. For applicants for military service, denial of accession made in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes sexual orientation discrimination. (c) Personnel and Administrative Policies and Action. This section prohibits the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating under the Navy, from establishing, implementing or applying any personnel or administrative policies, or taking an personnel or administrative action, in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. It is designed to prevent the military from re-instituting discriminatory policies once \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d is repealed. (d) Rules and Policies Regarding Conduct. This language is modeled on ENDA\u2019s Section 11 (a), \u201cConstruction: Employer Rules and Policies.\u201d It is intended to clarify that nothing in the legislation will prevent the military from continuing to regulate the conduct of its members, as long as any such regulation is written and enforced in a sexual orientation-neutral manner. (e) Re-accession of Otherwise Qualified Persons Permitted. This language provides the opportunity for persons discharged for homosexuality or homosexual conduct under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or its predecessor regulations to re-apply for entry into the Armed Forces. The \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d language makes clear that there is no absolute right of re-entry for anyone discharged under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or the predecessor regulations. For example, age and physical requirements to re-enter the military would still be applied to persons who wished to re-enter the Armed Forces under this provision. (f) Sexual Orientation. Sexual orientation is defined as \u201cheterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality, whether the orientation is real or perceived, and includes statements and consensual sexual conduct manifesting heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.\u201d This first part of this definition is fairly standard, and consistent with most state law definitions of sexual orientation. It is consistent with although broader than the only current federal statutory definition of sexual orientation, which appears in 28 U.S.C. 534, the federal hate crimes Continued on next page\u2026. reporting statute. This definition is \u201cconsensual homosexuality or heterosexuality.\u201d The second part of the definition is meant to ensure that the gap created between status and conduct through the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy will not persist beyond the policy\u2019s repeal. Military discharges based on statements of sexual orientation or conduct manifesting homosexual or bisexual orientation form the basis of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d The distinction is cemented in case law challenging the ban on constitutional grounds. Without the second part of this definition, it is possible Defense Department officials could effectively continue a policy of discriminating based on statements or conduct, versus sexual orientation per se. (2). Section 4 subsection (a)(2) provides the necessary changes to the table of contents to reflect the deletion of 10 U.S.C. 654 and the addition of 10 U.S.C. 656. (b). Conforming Amendments. Section 4 subsection (b) provides the conforming amendments required by the new legislation. (1). Subsection (b)(1) adds sexual orientation discrimination to a list of issues statutorily mandated for quadrennial surveys by the Department of Defense. (2). Subsection (b)(2) modifies the Solomon Amendment to remove the reference to 10 U.S.C. 654 and related laws. It is unclear whether the Solomon Amendment will have any relevance once the current Section 654 is repealed. However, the consequence of leaving 10 U.S.C. 983 as it is would be the possibility that certain schools might prohibit military recruiters from their campuses because of the military\u2019s new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation. (3). Subsection (b)(3) adds sexual orientation to the definition of \u201cunlawful discrimination\u201d in the code provision prohibiting retaliatory personnel actions. Section 5. Benefits. This provision makes clear that this legislation does not require the military to provide dependent benefits in violation of the Defense of Marriage Act. Section 6. No Private Cause of Action for Damages. This section makes clear that this legislation does not create a private cause of action for damages. Section 7. Regulations. This section provides the authority to issue regulations implementing this legislation and gives guidance as to the content of those regulations. (a). In General. The Secretary of Defense has 90 days following enactment of the legislation to issue Department of Defense regulations implementing the legislation, and must direct each service to revise its regulations no later than 180 days after the enactment of the legislation. Regulations which must be amended include but are not limited to: (1). All Equal Opportunity and Human Relations regulations, directives, and instructions and training guidance; (2). Personnel regulations governing involuntary discharges; (3). Victim\u2019s advocacy regulations to include sexual orientation discrimination among the forms of discrimination for which members of the Armed Forces and their families may seek assistance. This provision is intended to ensure that victims of sexual orientation-based hate violence and sexual orientation discrimination can access Victims\u2019 Advocacy programs to the same extent that other victims of prohibited discrimination and hate violence can. (b). Regulation of Conduct. This provision mandates the regulations governing service members\u2019 conduct be written and enforced without regard to sexual orientation. It is essentially a reiteration of Section 3 (c), but we think it is important that this concept appear in both the policy section and the regulation section of the legislation as a political matter. (c). Definition. This section provides reference to the new 10 USC 656(f) for the definition of sexual orientation. *** Again the highlighted line items are grey - as I explained above - to say the least and need to be clearly addressed. *** Either way, \"H.R. 1246,\" - if that is what is about to be on the table - is clearly suspect for a large number of reasons. Americans can do a lot better than that ... the GLBT community deserve better. Under Section 8 of the US Constitution, Congress can do much, much better. This message has been edited.

        "reply": "\"IHAWKERS'\" Thread: \"Change [...] Put on hold.\" appeared to tell a different story regarding the, \"timing,\" of such a Bill. This should be a real test of where the Administration stands. Surprising the Decromats' argument will be, \"recruiting.\" Democrats have a history of being spineless on real issues. The real issue is of, \"Equal Rights,\" of what will become a protected minority class under Federal Law, when this thing passess, or one like it. Again, sad the Democrats will attempt to hide behind, \"recruiting,\" verses the human rights of American citizens. Not to mention, in my opinion, \"Military Readiness,\" is also a weak argument in relation to this social issue relative to the necessary social change it implies. *** That said, it really becomes necessary to take a real close look at, \"H.R. 1246,\" if that is the Bill they will present, or if there are modifications, what are they, etc. (?): 1.) Unless something has changed, the subject Bill does not include the, \"T,\" in GLBT. This is an absolute human rights violation and the Democrats should be ashamed.

I'm talking about [...] a narrow and limited disclosure policy. I am only advocating that relevant professionals address, \"disclosure,\" in terms, of the real and perceived hostile environment(s) that exist in organizations [...]. [This is not v]iolating privacy rights[] - it's an all-voluteer force [...] They're the real professionals [...]. [...] To me, this fact infers the obvious, it is secondary to the greater good in social/organizational theory. GLBT, \"fear,\" that [...] is real, but not something from which to write Federal Policy on. It is a type of, \"fear,\" that you write Federal Policy in a way that enforces specifically, and strategically, the healthy environment to allow GLBT to overcome it.\" - The, \"EO,\" references may supersede the general language in the Bill, but I don't know for sure. It doesn't look like it. It actually looks like it prevents EO from doing its' job, \"How can you address, \"sexual orientation,\" if you're not allowed to intitiate any policies or regulations with, \"sexual orientation,\" as the basis? What it appears to do is tie the hands of EO officers by only allowing them to respond to issues. If that is the case, that is a poor knot to tie. - At a minimum, it deserves clarification. *** For further clarity. Red Bold mine: From SLDN regarding the original H.R. 1246: MILITARY READINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT (H.R. 1246) SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 provides the short title for the legislation. The \u201cMilitary Readiness Enhancement Act\u201d is the title of this legislation. Section 2. Purpose. Section 2 identifies the purpose of the legislation, which is to repeal 10 U.S.C. 654 and replace it with a new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. Section 3. Repeal of 1994 Policy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces. This section repeals the current law, 10 U.S.C. 654. Section 4. Policy of Non-Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation in the Armed Forces. (a). Establishment of Policy. This section establishes a new law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the Armed Forces. This section provides for a policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces, to be titled 10 U.S.C. 656. (a) Policy. Subsection (a) provides the new policy statement, prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination within the Armed Forces and among people seeking entry into the Armed Forces. (b) Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation. This subsection provides a non-exclusive list of what constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. For current members of the Armed Forces, this section includes within the definition of sexual orientation discrimination any personnel or administrative action taken in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. For applicants for military service, denial of accession made in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes sexual orientation discrimination. (c) Personnel and Administrative Policies and Action. This section prohibits the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating under the Navy, from establishing, implementing or applying any personnel or administrative policies, or taking an personnel or administrative action, in whole or in part on the basis of sexual orientation. It is designed to prevent the military from re-instituting discriminatory policies once \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d is repealed. (d) Rules and Policies Regarding Conduct. This language is modeled on ENDA\u2019s Section 11 (a), \u201cConstruction: Employer Rules and Policies.\u201d It is intended to clarify that nothing in the legislation will prevent the military from continuing to regulate the conduct of its members, as long as any such regulation is written and enforced in a sexual orientation-neutral manner. (e) Re-accession of Otherwise Qualified Persons Permitted. This language provides the opportunity for persons discharged for homosexuality or homosexual conduct under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or its predecessor regulations to re-apply for entry into the Armed Forces. The \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d language makes clear that there is no absolute right of re-entry for anyone discharged under \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d or the predecessor regulations. For example, age and physical requirements to re-enter the military would still be applied to persons who wished to re-enter the Armed Forces under this provision. (f) Sexual Orientation. Sexual orientation is defined as \u201cheterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality, whether the orientation is real or perceived, and includes statements and consensual sexual conduct manifesting heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.\u201d This first part of this definition is fairly standard, and consistent with most state law definitions of sexual orientation. It is consistent with although broader than the only current federal statutory definition of sexual orientation, which appears in 28 U.S.C. 534, the federal hate crimes Continued on next page\u2026. reporting statute. This definition is \u201cconsensual homosexuality or heterosexuality.\u201d The second part of the definition is meant to ensure that the gap created between status and conduct through the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy will not persist beyond the policy\u2019s repeal. Military discharges based on statements of sexual orientation or conduct manifesting homosexual or bisexual orientation form the basis of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d The distinction is cemented in case law challenging the ban on constitutional grounds. Without the second part of this definition, it is possible Defense Department officials could effectively continue a policy of discriminating based on statements or conduct, versus sexual orientation per se. (2). Section 4 subsection (a)(2) provides the necessary changes to the table of contents to reflect the deletion of 10 U.S.C. 654 and the addition of 10 U.S.C. 656. (b). Conforming Amendments. Section 4 subsection (b) provides the conforming amendments required by the new legislation. (1). Subsection (b)(1) adds sexual orientation discrimination to a list of issues statutorily mandated for quadrennial surveys by the Department of Defense. (2). Subsection (b)(2) modifies the Solomon Amendment to remove the reference to 10 U.S.C. 654 and related laws. It is unclear whether the Solomon Amendment will have any relevance once the current Section 654 is repealed. However, the consequence of leaving 10 U.S.C. 983 as it is would be the possibility that certain schools might prohibit military recruiters from their campuses because of the military\u2019s new policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation. (3). Subsection (b)(3) adds sexual orientation to the definition of \u201cunlawful discrimination\u201d in the code provision prohibiting retaliatory personnel actions. Section 5. Benefits. This provision makes clear that this legislation does not require the military to provide dependent benefits in violation of the Defense of Marriage Act. Section 6. No Private Cause of Action for Damages. This section makes clear that this legislation does not create a private cause of action for damages. Section 7. Regulations. This section provides the authority to issue regulations implementing this legislation and gives guidance as to the content of those regulations. (a). In General. The Secretary of Defense has 90 days following enactment of the legislation to issue Department of Defense regulations implementing the legislation, and must direct each service to revise its regulations no later than 180 days after the enactment of the legislation. Regulations which must be amended include but are not limited to: (1). All Equal Opportunity and Human Relations regulations, directives, and instructions and training guidance; (2). Personnel regulations governing involuntary discharges; (3). Victim\u2019s advocacy regulations to include sexual orientation discrimination among the forms of discrimination for which members of the Armed Forces and their families may seek assistance. This provision is intended to ensure that victims of sexual orientation-based hate violence and sexual orientation discrimination can access Victims\u2019 Advocacy programs to the same extent that other victims of prohibited discrimination and hate violence can. (b). Regulation of Conduct. This provision mandates the regulations governing service members\u2019 conduct be written and enforced without regard to sexual orientation. It is essentially a reiteration of Section 3 (c), but we think it is important that this concept appear in both the policy section and the regulation section of the legislation as a political matter. (c). Definition. This section provides reference to the new 10 USC 656(f) for the definition of sexual orientation. *** Again the highlighted line items are grey - as I explained above - to say the least and need to be clearly addressed. *** Either way, \"H.R. 1246,\" - if that is what is about to be on the table - is clearly suspect for a large number of reasons. Americans can do a lot better than that ... the GLBT community deserve better. Under Section 8 of the US Constitution, Congress can do much, much better. This message has been edited.

I have made the same micro-argument for quite some time now, and also feel passionate about it on a micro-level. That said, micro-arguments supporting specific minority Equal Rights, while distorting, ignoring, disregarding, or denying, the common macro-Equal Rights of all service members, fails in any logical arena except that of the subject minority group - which hasn't even happened on these boards, as I've had several GLBT members publicly acknowledge a universal and necessary, \"Right to Privacy\" - even in the US military, including a very specific submariner who posted with me on the very subject here, about a year and a half ago.\" *** Seperately, it appears to me, you keep harping on my suggested solutions within AAVPIPS as if those mere suggestions are my main arguments (?).

Administration officials will not reveal how it may happen or how soon, but some Democrats have suggested that a team of experts may be commissioned to investigate a proper reversal of the policy, according to the Associated Press. Obama has been consulting with Defense secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Michael Mullen \"so that this change is done in a sensible way that strengthens our armed forces and our national security,\" Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said in an e-mail this week. The reversal of the law is part of a campaign promise to which Obama is trying to adhere. California congresswoman Ellen Tauscher reintroduced legislation to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Tauscher's bill garnered 143 cosponsors when it was introduced in 2008, but it never reached a floor vote. Tauscher mentioned at an event Monday for the Center for American Progress Action Fund that 26 other countries, mostly allies like the United Kingdom and Germany, no longer have such bans on the books. She also said that if Colin Powell, who was the \"physical embodiment\" of opposition to openly gay service members, could change his mind now, it's time to make a change. \"Seventy-five percent of the American people believe that this is the wrong policy,\" she said, adding that \"we have a lot of people behind us.\" >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid74206.asp",

Administration officials will not reveal how it may happen or how soon, but some Democrats have suggested that a team of experts may be commissioned to investigate a proper reversal of the policy, according to the Associated Press. Obama has been consulting with Defense secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Michael Mullen \"so that this change is done in a sensible way that strengthens our armed forces and our national security,\" Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said in an e-mail this week. The reversal of the law is part of a campaign promise to which Obama is trying to adhere. California congresswoman Ellen Tauscher reintroduced legislation to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Tauscher's bill garnered 143 cosponsors when it was introduced in 2008, but it never reached a floor vote. Tauscher mentioned at an event Monday for the Center for American Progress Action Fund that 26 other countries, mostly allies like the United Kingdom and Germany, no longer have such bans on the books. She also said that if Colin Powell, who was the \"physical embodiment\" of opposition to openly gay service members, could change his mind now, it's time to make a change. \"Seventy-five percent of the American people believe that this is the wrong policy,\" she said, adding that \"we have a lot of people behind us.\" >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid74206.asp Excellent News!!

Rumor has it that....they believe that by 2012 there will be quite enough controversial issues on the table with which to deal. As a result, REVISION (not repeal) of DADT will be taken up seriously when/if a second term is in the offing.",
