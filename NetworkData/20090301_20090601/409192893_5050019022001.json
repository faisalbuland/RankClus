Back in those days, and this was true predominately in the South more so than in the North, citizens looked upon their individual states as their own sovereign countries. Robert E. Lee was greatly disturbed by a decision he would eventually have to make, since he was initially offered the command of all Federal armies in the Union, and at the same time saw his native Virginia as \"native soil.\" But as a devout and loyal career minded US Army officer who held the rank of Full-Colonel at the time, he did not take nor make his decision lightly, nor in haste. Painfully for him, because he was a Union Man at heart, he chose Virginia, and henceforth the Confederacy over the Union. Even after the war was over, he maintained he made the right decision, and said he would have done it all over again if need be. It wasn't so much that he was dedicated to the principles of the Confederacy, but he was absolutely dedicated to the defense of his home-his native Virginia. As lee said, \"I cannot raise my own sword against her.\" This is an interesting contrast to Sam Houston, who was instrumental in securing Texas independence from Mexico, but who helped bring Texas into the Union in 1845 as a state of the Union. When the seeds of secession were taking place in Texas during 1860-61, Houston, being a Pro-Union man was absolutely opposed to Texas seceeding and becoming a state of the Confederacy. Henceforth, Houston would himself become neutral during the CW, and took neither side. His life was threatened on several occasions by fellow Texans who were Southern sympathizers before and during the war. Things have changed alot in this country since 1860. My fear is not so much a \"South shall rise again scenario,\" but rather a group of states (or segments of states) in North, South, East and West forming some kind of an independent coalition, but would NOT be divided geographically from those areas choosing to stay in the Union, such as a Mason-Dixon line example. Well Flight Director, I didn't mean to rattle on like this, but your \"modern day\" scenario of a former 1860 gets very complicated to say the least. My hope is always that the Union shall maintain itself, even during the worst of political and economic upheaval!... This message has been edited.

Things have changed alot since 1860. Back in those days, and this was true predominately in the South more so than in the North, citizens looked upon their individual states as their own sovereign countries. Robert E. Lee was greatly disturbed by a decision he would eventually have to make, since he was initially offered the command of all Federal armies in the Union, and at the same time saw his native Virginia as \"native soil.\" But as a devout and loyal career minded US Army officer who held the rank of Full-Colonel at the time, he did not take nor make his decision lightly, nor in haste. Painfully for him, because he was a Union Man at heart, he chose Virginia, and henceforth the Confederacy over the Union. Even after the war was over, he maintained he made the right decision, and said he would have done it all over again if need be. It wasn't so much that he was dedicated to the principles of the Confederacy, but he was absolutely dedicated to the defense of his home-his native Virginia. As lee said, \"I cannot raise my own sword against her.\" This is an interesting contrast to Sam Houston, who was instrumental in securing Texas independence from Mexico, but who helped bring Texas into the Union in 1845 as a state of the Union. When the seeds of secession were taking place in Texas during 1860-61, Houston, being a Pro-Union man was absolutely opposed to Texas seceeding and becoming a state of the Confederacy. Henceforth, Houston would himself become neutral during the CW, and took neither side. His life was threatened on several occasions by fellow Texans who were Southern sympathizers before and during the war. Things have changed alot in this country since 1860. My fear is not so much a \"South shall rise again scenario,\" but rather a group of states (or segments of states) in North, South, East and West forming some kind of an independent coalition, but would NOT be divided geographically from those areas choosing to stay in the Union, such as a Mason-Dixon line example. Well Flight Director, I didn't mean to rattle on like this, but your \"modern day\" scenario of a former 1860 gets very complicated to say the least. My hope is always that the Union shall maintain itself, even during the worst of political and economic upheaval!... This message has been edited.

It is something I have looked at time and again and there is no easy answer or \"right\" answer... There are too many variables really. Personally I support the Constitution of the US, not the politicians, not the talking head, or any of those people. Should a Constitutional Convention be held, with a view to dissolving or restructuring the US, I would support sharply curtailing the power of the federal government to within the bounds described by the Constitution. Should such a measure prove unworkable, I would support the states using the convention to redefine the United States into a government or governments that they found more appealing to the people as a whole, even if it ment dissolving the nation and forming new ones composed of smaller numbers of states. Then, where my state went, I would follow.",

Things have changed alot since 1860. Back in those days, and this was true predominately in the South more so than in the North, citizens looked upon their individual states as their own sovereign countries. Robert E. Lee was greatly disturbed by a decision he would eventually have to make, since he was initially offered the command of all Federal armies in the Union, and at the same time saw his native Virginia as \"native soil.\" But as a devout and loyal career minded US Army officer who held the rank of Full-Colonel at the time, he did not take nor make his decision lightly, nor in haste. Painfully for him, because he was a Union Man at heart, he chose Virginia, and henceforth the Confederacy over the Union. Even after the war was over, he maintained he made the right decision, and said he would have done it all over again if need be. It wasn't so much that he was dedicated to the principles of the Confederacy, but he was absolutely dedicated to the defense of his home-his native Virginia. As lee said, \"I cannot raise my own sword against her.\" This is an interesting contrast to Sam Houston, who was instrumental in securing Texas independence from Mexico, but who helped bring Texas into the Union in 1845 as a state of the Union. When the seeds of secession were taking place in Texas during 1860-61, Houston, being a Pro-Union man was absolutely opposed to Texas seceeding and becoming a state of the Confederacy. Henceforth, Houston would himself become neutral during the CW, and took neither side. His life was threatened on several occasions by fellow Texans who were Southern sympathizers before and during the war. Things have changed alot in this country since 1860. My fear is not so much a \"South shall rise again scenario,\" but rather a group of states (or segments of states) in North, South, East and West forming some kind of an independent coalition, but would NOT be divided geographically from those areas choosing to stay in the Union, such as a Mason-Dixon line example. Well Flight Director, I didn't mean to rattle on like this, but your \"modern day\" scenario of a former 1860 gets very complicated to say the least. My hope is always that the Union shall maintain itself, even during the worst of political and economic upheaval!... This message has been edited.

As lee said, \"I cannot raise my own sword against her.\" This is an interesting contrast to Sam Houston, who was instrumental in securing Texas independence from Mexico, but who helped bring Texas into the Union in 1845 as a state of the Union. When the seeds of secession were taking place in Texas during 1860-61, Houston, being a Pro-Union man was absolutely opposed to Texas seceeding and becoming a state of the Confederacy. Henceforth, Houston would himself become neutral during the CW, and took neither side. His life was threatened on several occasions by fellow Texans who were Southern sympathizers before and during the war. Things have changed alot in this country since 1860. My fear is not so much a \"South shall rise again scenario,\" but rather a group of states (or segments of states) in North, South, East and West forming some kind of an independent coalition, but would NOT be divided geographically from those areas choosing to stay in the Union, such as a Mason-Dixon line example. Well Flight Director, I didn't mean to rattle on like this, but your \"modern day\" scenario of a former 1860 gets very complicated to say the least. My hope is always that the Union shall maintain itself, even during the worst of political and economic upheaval!... This message has been edited.

Back in those days, and this was true predominately in the South more so than in the North, citizens looked upon their individual states as their own sovereign countries. Robert E. Lee was greatly disturbed by a decision he would eventually have to make, since he was initially offered the command of all Federal armies in the Union, and at the same time saw his native Virginia as \"native soil.\" But as a devout and loyal career minded US Army officer who held the rank of Full-Colonel at the time, he did not take nor make his decision lightly, nor in haste. Painfully for him, because he was a Union Man at heart, he chose Virginia, and henceforth the Confederacy over the Union. Even after the war was over, he maintained he made the right decision, and said he would have done it all over again if need be. It wasn't so much that he was dedicated to the principles of the Confederacy, but he was absolutely dedicated to the defense of his home-his native Virginia. As lee said, \"I cannot raise my own sword against her.\" This is an interesting contrast to Sam Houston, who was instrumental in securing Texas independence from Mexico, but who helped bring Texas into the Union in 1845 as a state of the Union. When the seeds of secession were taking place in Texas during 1860-61, Houston, being a Pro-Union man was absolutely opposed to Texas seceeding and becoming a state of the Confederacy. Henceforth, Houston would himself become neutral during the CW, and took neither side. His life was threatened on several occasions by fellow Texans who were Southern sympathizers before and during the war. Things have changed alot in this country since 1860. My fear is not so much a \"South shall rise again scenario,\" but rather a group of states (or segments of states) in North, South, East and West forming some kind of an independent coalition, but would NOT be divided geographically from those areas choosing to stay in the Union, such as a Mason-Dixon line example.

As a resident of Illinois I'd need a couple hours to pack before I left the state to it's own ends, If it was california, I'd help some of them pack then wave bye bye to them, and take up a vigil on the Nevada border to ensure they don't come back. The Constitution was very well written by people who wanted to ensure the states maintained certain rights, and now that the federal government is continually searching and enacting laws that circumvent the rights given in the constitution to the states and even talking about rewriting it to make it more current I understand why some states are talking about leaving the union. Times have indeed changed, people have changed, beliefs have changed, but the Constitution has not changed- and it SHOULDN'T. The document is as relevant and current as the day it was written, only the people have changed. We as a people NEED to change back to the people we used to be NOT change the Constitution to accommodate our new ways and beliefs. In the case of Texas: I think they have a legitimate beef and should they decide to secede I will stand with them as America has changed into something I almost don't recognize anymore.",
