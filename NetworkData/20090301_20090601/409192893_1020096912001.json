However management is also at fault for continuing to give in to the increased union demands, accepting shoddy workmanship and not giving a damn about consumer complaints. Lest we forget, perhaps the biggest culprit is the federal government. The EPA's unending demands cost money, not to mention all the government restrictions, regulations and taxes. I'm would not be surprised if California (for example) doesn't shortly find it has over regulated automobiles to the point of extinction in that state. I've been 40 yrs in the automotive supply business and I can say there is no single culprit in their current sad state. You summed it up very well. I was in Auto supply for 8 years. and UAW...never again.",
