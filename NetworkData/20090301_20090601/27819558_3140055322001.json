The official bulletin says a new law will allow the partnership if both partners are at least 18 years old. The law will prohibit same-sex couples from adopting children together, but will require partners to provide care for each other's children from earlier relationships if the children are recognized as belonging to the partnership. The bill was approved by parliament in April and signed by President Laszlo Solyom earlier this week. >>>http://www.washblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=25429 One step at a time.",

The only legislation our Federal Government has successfully put into place for gay partnerships is the Defense of Marriage Act which was a step backwards. Even our neighbors Canada & Mexico are ahead of us!!!. Canada has fully recognized same-sex marriage and Mexico allows Civil Unions. People may not think this is true for Mexico but it is. Civil unions were enacted in the Mexican state of Coahuila, and under Mexican law each state must recognize the laws granted to individuals from other states, effectively legalizing civil unions nationwide. \"\"http://gaylife.about.com/od/gaymarriagebyregion/a/mexico.htm I am happy for the gays & lesbians in Hungary, even a little jealous that their country is a step ahead of us in Equality.",
