Even the most adamant gay rights activist should be able to see that. Between the economy, Iran, North Korea, and a myriad of other severe and pressing issues, there are just more pressing things for him to handle right now. Equal rights for gays are (sadly) a touchy issue for many people. Even though it shouldn't be a big deal, it will take a lot of focus and heated debate to work on this issue, and it would be a bigger distraction than it should be when there are more urgent issues. I've got no complaints (yet). At least Obama is not wasting his efforts pressing malicious anti-gay legislation like his predecessor did. If the issue were truly a matter of equal rights for an oppressed group, WHAT could possibly be MORE important? Shucks, even illegal immigrants enjoy more attention than h o m o s e x u a l s, no? Wonder why? Think about it. I know exactly why gays have been treated like second class citizens for centuries and continue to be treated like dirt today. It's because fundamentalist religion in this country has far too much sway. It's because ignorant people can still be convinced that sexual orientation is a \"deviant choice.\" It's because ignorant people still believe that gays are automatically HIV-infected, promiscuous, drug-using criminals who will rape children and sexually harass straight people. And people are dumb enough to keep believing those lies. That's why it's taken so long for gays to gain any footing in the realm of equal rights. However, when the entire economic system is cracking at the seams, and North Korea is launching missiles, and a pandemic is looming... those are things that could impact EVERYONE. Gays, straights, troops, civilians, the elderly, young children. Of course I think marriage rights and other equal rights for gays are important? Absolutely. Do I consider them to be pressing issues that SHOULD be fixed immediately? Yes. However, I'm a rational person who understands how Americans as a whole react to issues of equal rights for gays. It breaks out into a hissing and spitting match of people snarling and screaming at each other. The religious right has a field day throwing Bible verses at people, and politicians do this ridiculous tap-dance to make everyone happy without committing to anything, and everyone ignores every other important issue happening at any given time. It would be nice if people could just be rational about it, but since when have people been rational?",

One of the problems in soliciting information from the Vietnamese locals about gays & lesbians is they consider it bad behavior to talk openly about sexuality, and particularly bad behavior to talk about gay sex because it's considered shameful. Homosexuality is still a largely taboo subject in the traditionally patriarchal society, long ruled by Confucian social mores and Buddhist beliefs. \"http://www2.hu-Berlin.de/sexology/IES/Vietnam.HTML#1",

It's because fundamentalist religion in this country has far too much sway. It's because ignorant people can still be convinced that sexual orientation is a \"deviant choice.\" It's because ignorant people still believe that gays are automatically HIV-infected, promiscuous, drug-using criminals who will rape children and sexually harass straight people.

It breaks out into a hissing and spitting match of people snarling and screaming at each other. The religious right has a field day throwing Bible verses at people, and politicians do this ridiculous tap-dance to make everyone happy without committing to anything, and everyone ignores every other important issue happening at any given time. It would be nice if people could just be rational about it, but since when have people been rational? If 'marriage' is granted to gays, how can it be denied to ANY group of people?",

Children there are rarely clothed before they reach double digit ages. Many hours spent with elders of these cultures revealed that their language(s) included no words relating to h o m o s e x u a l i t y. Searching for some way to convey the meaning to them resulted in confusion, as such a concept was foreign to them. There were MANY ways in which same gendered persons related to one another, but NONE involved sexuality in any way. These societies were isolated from what we consider to be the 'civilized' world. I recall wondering how it was that pre-adolescent unclothed children never indulged in same sex activity. It occurred to me that perhaps their genetic makeup had somehow avoided what might have been a factor. When that notion was researched, it was discovered that large numbers of families in the 'civilized' world have produced gay offspring where NO genetic history of h o m o s e x u a l i t y had existed previously. Since my only experience occurred 40 years ago in the back-bush of Vietnam, I can testify only to the absence of same-sex relationships there & then. But, the fact that certain dialects have no word for anything relating to it is strong evidence that not ALL cultures have gay people.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Frank_A_Valdez: Homosexuality has existed, to one extent or another, in all cultures spread out across all different kinds of geographies. Don't make the mistake of believing that heterosexuality is normal simply because it's common. In many societies of Melanesia, especially in Papua New Guinea, same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century. The Etoro and Marind-anim for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. women in Lesotho engaged in socially sanctioned \"long term, erotic relationships\" called \"motsoalle\" male Azande warriors in the northern Congo routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in intercrural sex with their older husbands. The first recorded homosexual couple in history is commonly regarded as Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum, an Egyptian male couple, who lived around the 2400 BCE. The pair are portrayed in a nose-kissing position, the most intimate pose in Egyptian art, surrounded by what appear to be their heirs. Homosexual and transgender individuals were also common among other pre-conquest civilizations in Latin America, such as the Aztecs, Mayans, Quechuas, Moches, Zapotecs, and the Tupinamb\u00e1 of Brazil. In East Asia, same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history. Homosexuality in China, known as the pleasures of the bitten peach, the cut sleeve, or the southern custom, has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. in Thailand, Kathoey, or \"ladyboys,\" have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While Kathoey may encompass simple effeminacy or transvestism, it most commonly is treated in Thai culture as a third gender. They are generally accepted by society, and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior. The earliest Western documents concerning same-sex relationships are derived from ancient Greece. They depict a world in which relationships with women and relationships with youths were the essential foundation of a normal man's love life. Ancient Rome the situation was reversed. Though the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, free boys were off limits as sexual partners. All the emperors with the exception of Claudius took male lovers. The Hellenophile emperor Hadrian is renowned for his relationship with Antinous. During the Renaissance, wealthy cities in northern Italy\u2014Florence and Venice in particular\u2014were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome. A tradition of art and literature sprang up constructing Middle Eastern homosexuality. Muslim\u2014often Sufi\u2014poets in medieval Arab lands and in Persia wrote odes to the beautiful wine boys who served them in the taverns. In many areas the practice survived into modern times In Persia homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses, and coffee houses. In the early Safavid era (1501\u20131723), male houses of prostitution (amrad khane) were legally recognized and paid taxes. Persian poets, such as Sa\u2019di (d. 1291), Hafez (d. 1389), and Jami (d. 1492), wrote poems replete with homoerotic allusions. The two most commonly documented forms were commercial sex with transgender young males or males enacting transgender roles exemplified by the k\u00f6\u00e7eks and the bacch\u00e1s, and Sufi spiritual practices in which the practitioner admired the form of a beautiful boy in order to enter ecstatic states and glimpse the beauty of god. source:\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality#History_2",
