They elected the President but we all have to live with his an Congress' actions. Either one thing or the other will happen in 2010. We will either have a Republican Congress that will try to overcome some of the crap passed by the Democrats or we will have a Civil War. That will put the national debt back on the Democratic Admin where it belongs. Several have offered up solutions that would work to this administration that would fix our economy. They are not interested. They are in power now and will spend as much as they can, while they can. Looks like Consertative States of America (CSA)vice the Liberal States of America (LSA)coming soon.",
