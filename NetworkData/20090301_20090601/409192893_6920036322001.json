This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

But she didnt, and now she is being questioned on her fake rage and lies regarding the waterboarding. But be honest, other than the hemming and hawing over this waterboarding, nothing, not one thing, will be done about it, other than political posturing, which is what crazy azz nancy is doing, just like evan beyh(?). So go ahead SW, cry, b1tch and moan that this is all a republican thing, when in fact its both sides. you're just to damn blind to see it for what it is. GRAYMAN",

This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

I believe that Pelosi was informed and that she is now taking a page from the Bush/Cheney/Rove book of denying responsibility and and attacking your accusers. But, it has not been established that she, \"approved,\" of anything, just some serious and credible accusations that she knew and did not object. Also, the claim that her lying about her prior knowledge rises to the level of criminal actions is just more sour-grapes rightist spin propaganda. What is clearly happening here is that this is a rightist smoke screen trying to vilify Pelosi for lying about what she KNEW and when she knew it. The question all Americans should be asking is what we are going to do to hold accountable those in the Bush administration who DID these things? The right is jumping on the accountability bandwagon screaming at Pelosi for knowing about torturing going on, well, how about holding Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and the other rightist architects of this despicable policy accountable? Where is the rightist outrage there? My question to you, Keg, is how some of the Democrat leaders KNOWING about torture a crime while the Republican leadership COMMITTING that torture is viewed by the right as patriotic necessity?",

This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

Up front, I do not care for Peolsi, never have and I would not like to see her assume the presidency anymore than I liked Dubya being selected by the USSC in 2000 or re-elected in 2004. To me, she represents the same kind of party-first extremism that so defined the Republican leadership that placed Dubya in office and got us into this mess in the first place. However... I believe that Pelosi was informed and that she is now taking a page from the Bush/Cheney/Rove book of denying responsibility and and attacking your accusers. But, it has not been established that she, \"approved,\" of anything, just some serious and credible accusations that she knew and did not object. Also, the claim that her lying about her prior knowledge rises to the level of criminal actions is just more sour-grapes rightist spin propaganda. What is clearly happening here is that this is a rightist smoke screen trying to vilify Pelosi for lying about what she KNEW and when she knew it. The question all Americans should be asking is what we are going to do to hold accountable those in the Bush administration who DID these things? The right is jumping on the accountability bandwagon screaming at Pelosi for knowing about torturing going on, well, how about holding Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and the other rightist architects of this despicable policy accountable?

        "reply": " You would know all about playing the distraction game wouldn't you? It is your way everytime someone trys to discuss the dumb things BO does. Your game is to scream \"It's all Bush's fault.\" and lead the discussion in that old tired direction. Typical. The whole issue with Pelosi that she is a liar and she wouldn't hesitate to stab YOU in the back if she thought it was politically viable for her. The torture issue is a wholw seperate issue from the issue that she is a TWO-FACED LYING Witch. I guess it doesn't bother you in the least that this type of person has a lot of power and I bet you are proud that she is 3rd in line for the Presidency.",

This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

Up front, I do not care for Peolsi, never have and I would not like to see her assume the presidency anymore than I liked Dubya being selected by the USSC in 2000 or re-elected in 2004.

But, it has not been established that she, \"approved,\" of anything, just some serious and credible accusations that she knew and did not object. Also, the claim that her lying about her prior knowledge rises to the level of criminal actions is just more sour-grapes rightist spin propaganda. What is clearly happening here is that this is a rightist smoke screen trying to vilify Pelosi for lying about what she KNEW and when she knew it. The question all Americans should be asking is what we are going to do to hold accountable those in the Bush administration who DID these things? The right is jumping on the accountability bandwagon screaming at Pelosi for knowing about torturing going on, well, how about holding Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and the other rightist architects of this despicable policy accountable? Where is the rightist outrage there? My question to you, Keg, is how some of the Democrat leaders KNOWING about torture a crime while the Republican leadership COMMITTING that torture is viewed by the right as patriotic necessity?",

This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

She's lying to the American people about what she knew and approved of, and she's calling the CIA liars to cover her tracks. She wants to call torture a crime, that's fine. She was briefed on, and approved the enhanced interrogation techniques. That makes here a lying criminal and she should resign. Up front, I do not care for Peolsi, never have and I would not like to see her assume the presidency anymore than I liked Dubya being selected by the USSC in 2000 or re-elected in 2004. To me, she represents the same kind of party-first extremism that so defined the Republican leadership that placed Dubya in office and got us into this mess in the first place. However... I believe that Pelosi was informed and that she is now taking a page from the Bush/Cheney/Rove book of denying responsibility and and attacking your accusers. But, it has not been established that she, \"approved,\" of anything, just some serious and credible accusations that she knew and did not object. Also, the claim that her lying about her prior knowledge rises to the level of criminal actions is just more sour-grapes rightist spin propaganda. What is clearly happening here is that this is a rightist smoke screen trying to vilify Pelosi for lying about what she KNEW and when she knew it. The question all Americans should be asking is what we are going to do to hold accountable those in the Bush administration who DID these things? The right is jumping on the accountability bandwagon screaming at Pelosi for knowing about torturing going on, well, how about holding Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and the other rightist architects of this despicable policy accountable? Where is the rightist outrage there? My question to you, Keg, is how some of the Democrat leaders KNOWING about torture a crime while the Republican leadership COMMITTING that torture is viewed by the right as patriotic necessity?",

This is about what an administration, the Bush administration, DID...(i.e. torturing people in order to create a link between al Qaeda and Iraq) Powell aide says torture helped build Iraq war case (CNN) -- Finding a \"smoking gun\" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. \"Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,\" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been \"relentlessly digging\" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. \"I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,\" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the \"alternative\" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that \"we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run.\" \"The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,\" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now \"compliant,\" meaning agents recommended the use of \"alternative\" techniques should stop. At that point, \"The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,\" Wilkerson wrote. \"The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts.\" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a \"blot\" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation \"pivotal\" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. \"This is my opinion,\" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. \"Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.\" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence \"but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" the Senate report states. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html\"",

We were also deep in the war in 2002 had she got the information then, and had she went public with what she may have learned, her enemies would have branded her a traitor. Then she should have denied everything, she should have said she wasn't allowed to talk about the briefing, period. Instead she called the CIA liars, she opened herself up then. If they want to prosecute, then all responsible should be prosecuted. What law did she break?", 
        "reply": " She is an accomplise to torture, same as Bush, Cheney and other politicians. I have always been against waterboarding, I call it torture, therefore since she knew about it, she is as guilty as others that were involved. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?\" - Joseph Stalin",

It is your way everytime someone trys to discuss the dumb things BO does. Your game is to scream \"It's all Bush's fault.\" and lead the discussion in that old tired direction. Typical. The whole issue with Pelosi that she is a liar and she wouldn't hesitate to stab YOU in the back if she thought it was politically viable for her. The torture issue is a wholw seperate issue from the issue that she is a TWO-FACED LYING Witch. I guess it doesn't bother you in the least that this type of person has a lot of power and I bet you are proud that she is 3rd in line for the Presidency.",
