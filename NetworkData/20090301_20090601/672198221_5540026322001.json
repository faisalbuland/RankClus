        "content": "This evening Colbert had John McCains daughter on speaking on behalf of her new role within the Republican party as she signed up when she supported her father running for President. That I guess was the ultimate bonding moment for father and daughter. She is only 24 and said that she is pro life, pro sex and pro gay marraige. I have to say, Colbert was pretty tame with her and she was a little flush at times but did manage to stay on topic and get her point across. She was well thought out, not bitter, had ideas for the party going forward and enjoyed her sense of humor. Her response to pro sex is just that she does not think that is going to work for the old party. She took on that term prosex to oppose Bristol Palins stand on sex and abortion. McCains daughter thinks they should talk about the reality of sex at any age and the consquences of those actions. She wants it talked about in shcool, church, family home etc she feels you must have safe sex and more optioins like adoption if the condom is faulty. she said that no twittering, blogging etc was going to make anyone think the party has changed and are hip but she said the gop is a great party and there is a place for gay people within the party, and ways to work together to support education on sexual issues she thinks there are some really good old boys from the party but it is time for the next generation to step in and make a case for change. She would not talk about Palin or call anyone out. She just was sweet spoken with a message she wanted to get across. I think I am going to keep a watch on her. She seems to be coming off very well so I put her as one to watch. I think Obama has this for two terms and unless Michelle runs it will then go back to the right if they are ready to run with someone. We tackled the racial issue, now lets cross the female issue. It is time. It is time to start looking at a young Condi Rice, only she wont run..why?... but we need someone just like her. smart, well spoken, highly educated, was in the inner group,knows the players and looks the part. they are already trying to build up the GOP with the governors. They need to change this next election around to get the new breed of smart, fun, good looking people in there of the next generation. they need to spend the time in office doing great things for their states and wait for the opportunity to take the house back and a few governors could slip into senate seats What do you think,,is it possible to get a fresh intellegent female ready to run for President? Who is the list? Not Hillary, she will be too old. It would have Gop still has some female people to look at that might shine. I would love to hear your thoughts on this.",

That I guess was the ultimate bonding moment for father and daughter. She is only 24 and said that she is pro life, pro sex and pro gay marraige. I have to say, Colbert was pretty tame with her and she was a little flush at times but did manage to stay on topic and get her point across. She was well thought out, not bitter, had ideas for the party going forward and enjoyed her sense of humor. Her response to pro sex is just that she does not think that is going to work for the old party. She took on that term prosex to oppose Bristol Palins stand on sex and abortion. McCains daughter thinks they should talk about the reality of sex at any age and the consquences of those actions. She wants it talked about in shcool, church, family home etc she feels you must have safe sex and more optioins like adoption if the condom is faulty. she said that no twittering, blogging etc was going to make anyone think the party has changed and are hip but she said the gop is a great party and there is a place for gay people within the party, and ways to work together to support education on sexual issues she thinks there are some really good old boys from the party but it is time for the next generation to step in and make a case for change. She would not talk about Palin or call anyone out. She just was sweet spoken with a message she wanted to get across. I think I am going to keep a watch on her. She seems to be coming off very well so I put her as one to watch. I think Obama has this for two terms and unless Michelle runs it will then go back to the right if they are ready to run with someone. We tackled the racial issue, now lets cross the female issue. It is time. It is time to start looking at a young Condi Rice, only she wont run..why?... but we need someone just like her. smart, well spoken, highly educated, was in the inner group,knows the players and looks the part. they are already trying to build up the GOP with the governors. They need to change this next election around to get the new breed of smart, fun, good looking people in there of the next generation. they need to spend the time in office doing great things for their states and wait for the opportunity to take the house back and a few governors could slip into senate seats What do you think,,is it possible to get a fresh intellegent female ready to run for President? Who is the list? Not Hillary, she will be too old. It would have Gop still has some female people to look at that might shine. I would love to hear your thoughts on this.",

        "content": "This evening Colbert had John McCains daughter on speaking on behalf of her new role within the Republican party as she signed up when she supported her father running for President. That I guess was the ultimate bonding moment for father and daughter. She is only 24 and said that she is pro life, pro sex and pro gay marraige. I have to say, Colbert was pretty tame with her and she was a little flush at times but did manage to stay on topic and get her point across. She was well thought out, not bitter, had ideas for the party going forward and enjoyed her sense of humor.

McCains daughter thinks they should talk about the reality of sex at any age and the consquences of those actions. She wants it talked about in shcool, church, family home etc she feels you must have safe sex and more optioins like adoption if the condom is faulty. she said that no twittering, blogging etc was going to make anyone think the party has changed and are hip but she said the gop is a great party and there is a place for gay people within the party, and ways to work together to support education on sexual issues she thinks there are some really good old boys from the party but it is time for the next generation to step in and make a case for change. She would not talk about Palin or call anyone out. She just was sweet spoken with a message she wanted to get across. I think I am going to keep a watch on her.

It is time. It is time to start looking at a young Condi Rice, only she wont run..why?... but we need someone just like her. smart, well spoken, highly educated, was in the inner group,knows the players and looks the part. they are already trying to build up the GOP with the governors. They need to change this next election around to get the new breed of smart, fun, good looking people in there of the next generation. they need to spend the time in office doing great things for their states and wait for the opportunity to take the house back and a few governors could slip into senate seats What do you think,,is it possible to get a fresh intellegent female ready to run for President? Who is the list? Not Hillary, she will be too old. It would have Gop still has some female people to look at that might shine. I would love to hear your thoughts on this.",

        "reply": "This evening Colbert had John McCains daughter on speaking on behalf of her new role within the Republican party as she signed up when she supported her father running for President. That I guess was the ultimate bonding moment for father and daughter. She is only 24 and said that she is pro life, pro sex and pro gay marraige. I have to say, Colbert was pretty tame with her and she was a little flush at times but did manage to stay on topic and get her point across. She was well thought out, not bitter, had ideas for the party going forward and enjoyed her sense of humor. Her response to pro sex is just that she does not think that is going to work for the old party. She took on that term prosex to oppose Bristol Palins stand on sex and abortion.

Who knows, you might see both parties moving a little to the middle with me in the next few years. hehe A \"fresh new look\" does not mean leaving behind all of the values that the Republican Party has stood for. Which is what Meghan McCain keeps preaching. She wants the party to be \"democrat light\" which is not what the American people will be looking for in the next eight years. Meghan McCain is doing nothing but promoting her \"celebrity\" riding on her fathers coat tails. She is not a leader of the Republican Party. She is simply the \"flavor of the month\" for the main stream media to use to attack the GOP. You just hang on to that idea and we will have 16 years not 8. funny you mention life after Obama. When I think about who could run against Obama next time around, I really can't come up with anyone strong enough at this point. So, in my mind I think OK, 8 years with Obama and maybe the Reps can at least get the house back to keep it even with checks and balance. Then I think of life after Obama and if the Reps play the game right and Obama does not live up to the expectations, the Replican party has a chance again, but who would run? Now that the race card is off the table it is time for a women to be seated as President, only fair right? heheh",
