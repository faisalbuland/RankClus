Kind of like the movie \"Freedom Writers\" in which the white, female teacher helps out the black and latino youth. It was clearly a liberal-leaning film, but the irony was that it seemed to support the concept of White Man's Burden. You know, \"here comes the Progressive, liberal white person to save the \"savages\" from themselves.\" But then, the Democratic Party is the ultimate abuser of carrot and stick tactics, and has done more social damage than any hate group ever could. Quite ironic. Going back to the movies dealing with homosexuality, they're films that simply don't interest me. I'm not bothered that they exist, but it seems that such films only care about the issue of homosexuality. Surely, homosexuals identify themselves as being more than just gay. Having said that, I've always wanted to see the \"legendary\" Brokeback Mountain. Whenever I was hanging out with my friends and we were trying to figure out what to do, I would suggest that we rent Brokeback Mountain, have a few beers, and see what happens. There weren't any takers...hardy har har. Anyway, my point is that these types of films fall prey to Hollywood's version of what the world looks like, and I simply don't subscribe to their B.S. And Sean Penn's name being attached to a film is usually a good indicator, aside from Team America: World Police of course; that was his best role ever!",

Kind of like the movie \"Freedom Writers\" in which the white, female teacher helps out the black and latino youth. It was clearly a liberal-leaning film, but the irony was that it seemed to support the concept of White Man's Burden. You know, \"here comes the Progressive, liberal white person to save the \"savages\" from themselves.\" But then, the Democratic Party is the ultimate abuser of carrot and stick tactics, and has done more social damage than any hate group ever could. Quite ironic. Going back to the movies dealing with homosexuality, they're films that simply don't interest me. I'm not bothered that they exist, but it seems that such films only care about the issue of homosexuality. Surely, homosexuals identify themselves as being more than just gay. Having said that, I've always wanted to see the \"legendary\" Brokeback Mountain. Whenever I was hanging out with my friends and we were trying to figure out what to do, I would suggest that we rent Brokeback Mountain, have a few beers, and see what happens. There weren't any takers...hardy har har. Anyway, my point is that these types of films fall prey to Hollywood's version of what the world looks like, and I simply don't subscribe to their B.S. And Sean Penn's name being attached to a film is usually a good indicator, aside from Team America: World Police of course; that was his best role ever!",
