Actually, it was overexposed consumer confidence that helped to get us into this mess. To try to push it back up to that level is suicide. The fundamental problems that we have now are complex and far from mended. Our banks are not functional due to their inability to reach their 10% reserve due to assets still losing value. The dollar index is going down. Notices of default on prime homes are at record levels, indicating a next wave of foreclosures much larger than the first. We have an unemployment rate of 8.9%, which is actually the U3 report. The U6 report has the unemployment rate at 15.8%. That's a lot! The most important fundamental issues are our debt and our GDP. We are having far too much trouble selling enough bonds to cover what we are spending. So, the Federal Reserve started buying bonds in what is called quantitative easing. That is never a good thing for the dollar, it means inflation. But, just today the Fed announced that it will also be purchasing TIPS from the Treasury. These are inflation protected bonds. Why would the Fed want those? We are running a huge deficit while the Fed has issued roughly $12 Trillion. That's why. Our GDP has gone down 6.1% in the first quarter from an already staggering blow in previous quarters. Plus, our GDP is 70% consumer based. So, these rises in consuming aren't doing a damn thing to bring up a GDP that consuming already takes over 2/3 of. With unemployment, foreclosures and credit card defaults all on the rise, I would be willing to guess that consumer confidence is preparing for the worst and just maxing out. Focusing on negative numbers is just being realistic in this case. Consumer spending is not going to make a dent in this. We are in a monetary crisis right now combined with a banking crisis. Shoot, we are very close to losing out AAA rating. China is asking for another reserve currency and is currently doing business with other countries in currencies other than the dollar.

I understand that the unemployment numbers will not reflect certain cases which have run out of benefits, or those who have given up on looking, so 8.5 is a bit low. I also understand that moratoriums and ARMs which haven't yet reset will raise the raw number of foreclosures yet to be announced, but are we destroying investor confidence and bankrupting our retirements by zeroing in on negative numbers? yeah right and today it is in the dumper",

Circumvent the capitalization required by banking regulations and common sense by using Collaterlized Debt Obligations. Make sure they're rated AAA by having the rating agencies remunerated by the players selling the 'Asset' Backed Securities. 'Create' wealth with no basis in the production of anything except increasingly complex instruments. 'Guarantee' those instruments with Credit Default Swaps valued at 4 times the total net worth of the issuing agencies...That's not banking, and it's not investing--it's MBA level larceny and fraud. I agree that much of that paper has yet to be properly valued--it would mean locking in losses on a massive scale, but I do believe that the housing market, like the Dow, will be rising sooner rather than later and the losses on some of that paper will at least be mitigated. You'll find that many of the old-school banks are lending much as if none of this occurred, quite simply because they didn't play the game then and don't play it now. Those 'solvent' institutions won't lend or issue credit cards to the flippers and wannabes who played the 'unwitting victims' being woodshedded by the bulls. UAW is about to accept their haircut to keep GM out of court; the CAW has done the same--whether the bondholders will follow remains to be seen. Investors are buying common stock again--putting hard currency into the operations of companies which actually produce goods and services. I'm closing on a house this month, and remodeling big time--as a primary residence. I'm not buying the doomsday scenario, but it makes for entertaining reading.

This recession is not tied to the confidence of consumers. Actually, it was overexposed consumer confidence that helped to get us into this mess. To try to push it back up to that level is suicide. The fundamental problems that we have now are complex and far from mended. Our banks are not functional due to their inability to reach their 10% reserve due to assets still losing value. The dollar index is going down. Notices of default on prime homes are at record levels, indicating a next wave of foreclosures much larger than the first. We have an unemployment rate of 8.9%, which is actually the U3 report. The U6 report has the unemployment rate at 15.8%. That's a lot! The most important fundamental issues are our debt and our GDP. We are having far too much trouble selling enough bonds to cover what we are spending. So, the Federal Reserve started buying bonds in what is called quantitative easing. That is never a good thing for the dollar, it means inflation. But, just today the Fed announced that it will also be purchasing TIPS from the Treasury. These are inflation protected bonds. Why would the Fed want those? We are running a huge deficit while the Fed has issued roughly $12 Trillion. That's why. Our GDP has gone down 6.1% in the first quarter from an already staggering blow in previous quarters. Plus, our GDP is 70% consumer based. So, these rises in consuming aren't doing a damn thing to bring up a GDP that consuming already takes over 2/3 of. With unemployment, foreclosures and credit card defaults all on the rise, I would be willing to guess that consumer confidence is preparing for the worst and just maxing out. Focusing on negative numbers is just being realistic in this case. Consumer spending is not going to make a dent in this. We are in a monetary crisis right now combined with a banking crisis.

We are screwed. Apologies for not being more clear: I do understand the complexities--I'm drawing a (perhaps tenuous) line between increased consumer confidence, and the availability of real, private investor, free market capital through increased investor confidence. I take issue with the 10% capitilization you speak of as so much smoke--40 years ago maybe, but the recent trend to 30 to 1 leveraging doesn't leave room for anything like 10 percent to cover losses.

Actually, it was overexposed consumer confidence that helped to get us into this mess. To try to push it back up to that level is suicide. The fundamental problems that we have now are complex and far from mended. Our banks are not functional due to their inability to reach their 10% reserve due to assets still losing value. The dollar index is going down. Notices of default on prime homes are at record levels, indicating a next wave of foreclosures much larger than the first. We have an unemployment rate of 8.9%, which is actually the U3 report. The U6 report has the unemployment rate at 15.8%. That's a lot! The most important fundamental issues are our debt and our GDP. We are having far too much trouble selling enough bonds to cover what we are spending. So, the Federal Reserve started buying bonds in what is called quantitative easing. That is never a good thing for the dollar, it means inflation. But, just today the Fed announced that it will also be purchasing TIPS from the Treasury. These are inflation protected bonds. Why would the Fed want those? We are running a huge deficit while the Fed has issued roughly $12 Trillion. That's why. Our GDP has gone down 6.1% in the first quarter from an already staggering blow in previous quarters. Plus, our GDP is 70% consumer based. So, these rises in consuming aren't doing a damn thing to bring up a GDP that consuming already takes over 2/3 of. With unemployment, foreclosures and credit card defaults all on the rise, I would be willing to guess that consumer confidence is preparing for the worst and just maxing out. Focusing on negative numbers is just being realistic in this case. Consumer spending is not going to make a dent in this. We are in a monetary crisis right now combined with a banking crisis. Shoot, we are very close to losing out AAA rating. China is asking for another reserve currency and is currently doing business with other countries in currencies other than the dollar.

I understand that the unemployment numbers will not reflect certain cases which have run out of benefits, or those who have given up on looking, so 8.5 is a bit low. I also understand that moratoriums and ARMs which haven't yet reset will raise the raw number of foreclosures yet to be announced, but are we destroying investor confidence and bankrupting our retirements by zeroing in on negative numbers? yeah right and today it is in the dumper",

Circumvent the capitalization required by banking regulations and common sense by using Collaterlized Debt Obligations. Make sure they're rated AAA by having the rating agencies remunerated by the players selling the 'Asset' Backed Securities. 'Create' wealth with no basis in the production of anything except increasingly complex instruments. 'Guarantee' those instruments with Credit Default Swaps valued at 4 times the total net worth of the issuing agencies...That's not banking, and it's not investing--it's MBA level larceny and fraud. I agree that much of that paper has yet to be properly valued--it would mean locking in losses on a massive scale, but I do believe that the housing market, like the Dow, will be rising sooner rather than later and the losses on some of that paper will at least be mitigated. You'll find that many of the old-school banks are lending much as if none of this occurred, quite simply because they didn't play the game then and don't play it now. Those 'solvent' institutions won't lend or issue credit cards to the flippers and wannabes who played the 'unwitting victims' being woodshedded by the bulls. UAW is about to accept their haircut to keep GM out of court; the CAW has done the same--whether the bondholders will follow remains to be seen. Investors are buying common stock again--putting hard currency into the operations of companies which actually produce goods and services. I'm closing on a house this month, and remodeling big time--as a primary residence. I'm not buying the doomsday scenario, but it makes for entertaining reading.

This recession is not tied to the confidence of consumers. Actually, it was overexposed consumer confidence that helped to get us into this mess. To try to push it back up to that level is suicide. The fundamental problems that we have now are complex and far from mended. Our banks are not functional due to their inability to reach their 10% reserve due to assets still losing value. The dollar index is going down. Notices of default on prime homes are at record levels, indicating a next wave of foreclosures much larger than the first. We have an unemployment rate of 8.9%, which is actually the U3 report. The U6 report has the unemployment rate at 15.8%. That's a lot! The most important fundamental issues are our debt and our GDP. We are having far too much trouble selling enough bonds to cover what we are spending. So, the Federal Reserve started buying bonds in what is called quantitative easing. That is never a good thing for the dollar, it means inflation. But, just today the Fed announced that it will also be purchasing TIPS from the Treasury. These are inflation protected bonds. Why would the Fed want those? We are running a huge deficit while the Fed has issued roughly $12 Trillion. That's why. Our GDP has gone down 6.1% in the first quarter from an already staggering blow in previous quarters. Plus, our GDP is 70% consumer based. So, these rises in consuming aren't doing a damn thing to bring up a GDP that consuming already takes over 2/3 of. With unemployment, foreclosures and credit card defaults all on the rise, I would be willing to guess that consumer confidence is preparing for the worst and just maxing out. Focusing on negative numbers is just being realistic in this case. Consumer spending is not going to make a dent in this. We are in a monetary crisis right now combined with a banking crisis.

We are screwed. Apologies for not being more clear: I do understand the complexities--I'm drawing a (perhaps tenuous) line between increased consumer confidence, and the availability of real, private investor, free market capital through increased investor confidence. I take issue with the 10% capitilization you speak of as so much smoke--40 years ago maybe, but the recent trend to 30 to 1 leveraging doesn't leave room for anything like 10 percent to cover losses.

Actually, it was overexposed consumer confidence that helped to get us into this mess. To try to push it back up to that level is suicide. The fundamental problems that we have now are complex and far from mended. Our banks are not functional due to their inability to reach their 10% reserve due to assets still losing value. The dollar index is going down. Notices of default on prime homes are at record levels, indicating a next wave of foreclosures much larger than the first. We have an unemployment rate of 8.9%, which is actually the U3 report. The U6 report has the unemployment rate at 15.8%. That's a lot! The most important fundamental issues are our debt and our GDP. We are having far too much trouble selling enough bonds to cover what we are spending. So, the Federal Reserve started buying bonds in what is called quantitative easing. That is never a good thing for the dollar, it means inflation. But, just today the Fed announced that it will also be purchasing TIPS from the Treasury. These are inflation protected bonds. Why would the Fed want those? We are running a huge deficit while the Fed has issued roughly $12 Trillion. That's why. Our GDP has gone down 6.1% in the first quarter from an already staggering blow in previous quarters. Plus, our GDP is 70% consumer based. So, these rises in consuming aren't doing a damn thing to bring up a GDP that consuming already takes over 2/3 of. With unemployment, foreclosures and credit card defaults all on the rise, I would be willing to guess that consumer confidence is preparing for the worst and just maxing out. Focusing on negative numbers is just being realistic in this case. Consumer spending is not going to make a dent in this. We are in a monetary crisis right now combined with a banking crisis. Shoot, we are very close to losing out AAA rating. China is asking for another reserve currency and is currently doing business with other countries in currencies other than the dollar.

I understand that the unemployment numbers will not reflect certain cases which have run out of benefits, or those who have given up on looking, so 8.5 is a bit low. I also understand that moratoriums and ARMs which haven't yet reset will raise the raw number of foreclosures yet to be announced, but are we destroying investor confidence and bankrupting our retirements by zeroing in on negative numbers? yeah right and today it is in the dumper",
