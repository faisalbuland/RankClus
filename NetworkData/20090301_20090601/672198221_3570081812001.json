The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now signed on as a national partner with the U.S. Census Bureau in February 2009 to assist with the recruitment of the 1.4 million temporary workers needed to go door-to-door to count every person in the United States -- currently believed to be more than 306 million people. \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/17/lawmakers-concerned-role-acorn-census/\" This is just another step by the Obama administration to take over the Census: President Obama said in his inaugural address that he planned to \"restore science to its rightful place\" in government. That's a worthy goal. But statisticians at the Commerce Department didn't think it would mean having the director of next year's Census report directly to the White House rather than to the Commerce secretary, as is customary. \"There's only one reason to have that high level of White House involvement,\" a career professional at the Census Bureau tells me. \"And it's called politics, not science.\" \"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123423384887066377.html\" The U.S. Census is being transfered to the White House instead of the Commerce Department where it has long resided. The Obama administration is politicizing what has very traditionally been a nonpartisan / non-political government undertaking. Do Democrats here or anywhere really support this move? Do you not realize this is opening the door to pandoras box? Democrats won't be in power forever and when they lose it, do they think Republicans won't \"return the favor\" in spades? I believe this is gross abuse of power and I wouldn't support it no matter who was doing it.",
