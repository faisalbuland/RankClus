The city of David in Panama is not too far from Costa Rica and I could drive across the boarder within an hour. Panama allows retirees many benefits such as no home owners taxes for the first 20 years. No income taxes, 50% off hotel rooms during the week, 30% discount on food bought in restaurants. Discounts on prescriptions, a good VA medical clinic. Some great 5 star restaurants and beer cost $0.43 a bottle! The $400.00 a month I pay in taxes here in the US could go for a full time maid/cook and Gardner in Panama. When I was stationed in Panama back in 1981, I fell in love with the ocean, jungle, and the little road side bars that I stopped at to get a bite to eat and a cold one. Sure things have changed but some have not. I'm just hanging on till the wife retires from Civil Service. My remains will still be scattered over the out field at Yankee Stadium when I die.",

I'm telling you all this right now. If you all thought Bush was messed up an Obama and his side kicks are the answer then we are doomed as a nation. Could you provide the quote that Obama said bankruptcy was \"not an option\"? Second paragraph. For anyone who was listening in January, February and March of this year bankruptcy was clearly not the favored option of the administration. \"http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/business/companies/article/obama_bankruptcy_filing_new_lease_on_life_for_chrysler/264735/\" So what your saying is, it was always an option. I thought so. Perhaps Duster has the quote where Obama stated it wasn't an option. Why is it so important that reality be edited to suit your partisan needs? In Jan and Feb Obama was adamant that the \"Big 3\" not be allowed to enter bankruptcy as it would be catastrophic for the economy. Billions of dollars later we are experiencing what most believed was inevitable and apparently it is necessary that for some the words of The One be changed to reflect the new reality. By all means reply with a forceful psyho-rant, it will not, however, change reality. You could save a lot of time if you'd just provide the quote instead of what you think you heard.",
