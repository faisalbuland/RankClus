The confusion between these concepts is why protestants such as Methodists and others use the Apostles Creed instead of the Nicean Creed. The Nicean Creed states that Jesus was crucified,died and descended to hell, ascended and was resurrected on the third day. This to accomodate the idea of Purgatory and Limbo. Life after death but without an explanation about judgement being fully explained, created the need for purgatory, and Limbo for the innocent, such as babes in arms and the like.

With the advent of the reconstruction and then John and Charles Wesley there was a new movement to read ONLY what was in the book no interpreting \"what it really meant\" to conform with preconcieved dogma, but only what it said!! This is the mistake I made when I was confirmed as a Methodist at the tender age of not quite thirteen. After listening to our pastor make horrendous statements about Catholics and other denominations I bought and began to read the Bible sans interpreters, just like it was a book. I bought a concordance, and a Bible dictionary, and it took years till my mid twenties, but it was so easy to understand that way for me. Then I began to study with the Jehova's Witnesses for a couple of years and used their literal interpretation and compared it to mine and found that STILL there was some wierd stuff creeping in and I would point out to them where these points were. Didn't do any good....surprise!! When after about 1991 I really buckled down and formalized my commitment and then in 2002 totally commited to ministry and studied with mentors at the highest level I had yet engaged. I found my understandings almost perfectly in line with Wesleyan Theology. A few more years of study collecting my course hours from Duke from the early seventies, some judicious parlaying, a thesis, and then a disertation with it's defense and Viola, D.D. and Ordination. This is why I get in trouble on the threads so much with the more fundamental of us. I will not compromise and I have reason to believe that I am right. I will not discuss why I am convinced of that, but you have read enough of my stuff and no doubt, like Bill, have perused some of my writings from my blog and the T.P.O.A. site as well. So there's no need to belabor the point. Also the Center for Religious Tolerance has carried some of my maunderings as well. And, you have seen me present many times what you have stated. ALL the writings in the Bible have come through the filter of men's minds and the culture of their times and that must be taken into account when reading the book. I just wrote two days ago about this, on another thread. But it was once again my admonition to remember that the book is about people. The God part is easy to understand and is in fact, predictable, it is the part about the people and how they failed to learn what the true point of the book is...look inside your self and listen to the answers that you get as you consider what god wants of you. Very few indeed can do that, or even consider themselves in the naked light of day and accept themselves as they are, with no, shall we say, embellishment!! By the way, I have always thought you are one who can. As sharp as he is sometimes so is Bill and K.J. is without peer in self examination. Perhaps you have noticed others of no faith structure that have no problem with me either, I don't challenge or denigrate them for this they also serve who but live in the world!!

T The church may have done away with the prohibition of non-fish flesh on Friday, but I'm here to tell you that hasn't stopped that other Wisconsin religious institution, the bars and \"supper clubs,\" from offering very little else for food on Fridays. I don't think everybody got the word. I usually make it a point to order a nice juicy steak off the a la carte menu. The VFW in Appleton is big HUGE on its Friday fish fry. Nearly a thousand wait in line, take a number, have a drink, and a constant stream run in and out the front door. It's mayhem, and, in my humble opinion, idiocy. Then I get the line that fish is good for you, which of course the Lord knew all along. Yeah... if it's not breaded and supersaturated with peanut oil at 350 degrees. Omega three, my butt. And that double Manhattan just before the meal is probably healthy, too. ...Praise the Lord and pass the Maraschinos.",

A lot of my Catholic friends not having seen the encyclicals wondered, and still do, if the people who went to hell for eating meat on fridays, got a \"get out of jail card\" when that was declared!! The Papal encyclical declared that the previous understandings were from antiquity and found to be in error to support eternal life after death. Scripturally that is correct because Jesus said \"The dead are conscious of nothing\" so after you die you are conscious of nothing till the resurrection. Many believe this and when questioned about it, I explain it as remembering when you were a kid on a car trip and your parents told you go to sleep and when we get there we'll wake you up!! Well they did and you didn't know any time had elapsed.....remember that feeling?? well maybe that's what it's like. Jesus also said that those who believe on Him even though they die, shall not taste death. So, when you pass over, you go to be with Christ, if found worthy. If not, you wait for the \"White Throne judgement\". Not really that confusing, when explained scripturally, instead of attaching a whole bunch of denominational dogma. The confusion between these concepts is why protestants such as Methodists and others use the Apostles Creed instead of the Nicean Creed. The Nicean Creed states that Jesus was crucified,died and descended to hell, ascended and was resurrected on the third day. This to accomodate the idea of Purgatory and Limbo. Life after death but without an explanation about judgement being fully explained, created the need for purgatory, and Limbo for the innocent, such as babes in arms and the like. The older Apostles Creed states that Jesus was crucified, died, and on the third day was resurrected. See the difference? Theologically it is HUGE!! T", 
        "reply": " The church may have done away with the prohibition of non-fish flesh on Friday, but I'm here to tell you that hasn't stopped that other Wisconsin religious institution, the bars and \"supper clubs,\" from offering very little else for food on Fridays. I don't think everybody got the word. I usually make it a point to order a nice juicy steak off the a la carte menu. The VFW in Appleton is big HUGE on its Friday fish fry. Nearly a thousand wait in line, take a number, have a drink, and a constant stream run in and out the front door. It's mayhem, and, in my humble opinion, idiocy. Then I get the line that fish is good for you, which of course the Lord knew all along. Yeah... if it's not breaded and supersaturated with peanut oil at 350 degrees. Omega three, my butt. And that double Manhattan just before the meal is probably healthy, too. ...Praise the Lord and pass the Maraschinos.",

Here's my \"Islamic\" take on the subject. God gave the revelation to man either through Prophets, Messengers, or Angels. Those men who heard the message and/or compiled it, did what they will. God is obviously fully capable of just giving the revelation Himself, as He did with the first set of commandments, but His pattern has been to give the revelation to man in order for man to use and obey. As Muslims, we believe that this was the pattern prior to the advent of the Qur'an i.e. the hands off approach, and that given mans reckless abandon and usage of the revelation God decided to reveal the Qur'an and guard it against corruption. Obviously this is a matter of Muslim faith that I don't accept non-Muslims to buy, but that is what we believe. We believe that the Qur'an the only religious text in which God directly states that He will guard it against corruption, is true, and we back that claim up with the fact that there exists only One Qur'an that all Muslims read and the fact that the scriptural, translation, and historical issues that plague other religious writ do not exist with the Qur'an at all. Now this point was not to diminish any text but more to expound on my beliefs. That being said, I believe Tawodi was on the mark, by in so many ways stating that it's not that God isn't capable, but that it was given to man as a sacred trust and man \"filtered\" it. The real debate is why did God choose to do it this way? and How accurate is the filter?",

He decides to destroy all humans, beasts, creeping things, fowls, and \"all flesh wherein there is breath of life.\" He plans to drown them all. 6:7, 17 God repeats his intention to kill \"every living substance ... from off the face of the earth.\" 7:4 God drowns everything that breathes air. From newborn babies to koala bears -- all creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned them all. 7:21-23 God sends a plague on the Pharaoh and his household because the Pharaoh believed Abram's lie. 12:17 God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless slaughter makes God feel better. 15:9-10 \"I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\" I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in Genesis 19. Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children. 18:32 God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah by raining \"fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.\" Well, almost everyone -- he spares the \"just and righteous\" Lot and his family. 19:24 Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 19:26 God threatens to kill Abimelech and his people for believing Abe's lie. 20:3-7 Sarai tells Abraham to \"cast out this bondwoman and her son.\" God commands him to \"hearken unto her voice.\" So Abraham abandons Hagar and Ishmael, casting them out into the wilderness to die. 21:10-14 God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham shows his love for God by his willingness to murder his son. But finally, just before Isaac's throat is slit, God provides a goat to kill instead. 22:2-13 Abraham shows his willingness to kill his son for God. Only an monster would ask a father to do that; only a bad father would be willing to do it. 22:10 \"The terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them.\" 35:5 \"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.\" What did Er do to elicit God's wrath? The Bible doesn't say. Maybe he picked up some sticks on Saturday. 38:7 After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to \"go in unto thy brother's wife.\" But \"Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew him also.\" This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 38:8-10 God brought a seven year, \"very greivous\" famine on the whole earth for no apparent reason (except maybe to make Joseph wealthy). 41:25-32, 54 These monstrous acts are in one book. Shall we do the rest?",

        "reply": " Really? What's your basis for that statement? Have you read His Book? Let's take a look at just Genesis: God is angry. He decides to destroy all humans, beasts, creeping things, fowls, and \"all flesh wherein there is breath of life.\" He plans to drown them all. 6:7, 17 God repeats his intention to kill \"every living substance ... from off the face of the earth.\" 7:4 God drowns everything that breathes air. From newborn babies to koala bears -- all creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned them all. 7:21-23 God sends a plague on the Pharaoh and his household because the Pharaoh believed Abram's lie. 12:17 God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless slaughter makes God feel better. 15:9-10 \"I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\" I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in Genesis 19.

The Papal encyclical declared that the previous understandings were from antiquity and found to be in error to support eternal life after death. Scripturally that is correct because Jesus said \"The dead are conscious of nothing\" so after you die you are conscious of nothing till the resurrection. Many believe this and when questioned about it, I explain it as remembering when you were a kid on a car trip and your parents told you go to sleep and when we get there we'll wake you up!! Well they did and you didn't know any time had elapsed.....remember that feeling?? well maybe that's what it's like. Jesus also said that those who believe on Him even though they die, shall not taste death. So, when you pass over, you go to be with Christ, if found worthy. If not, you wait for the \"White Throne judgement\". Not really that confusing, when explained scripturally, instead of attaching a whole bunch of denominational dogma. The confusion between these concepts is why protestants such as Methodists and others use the Apostles Creed instead of the Nicean Creed. The Nicean Creed states that Jesus was crucified,died and descended to hell, ascended and was resurrected on the third day. This to accomodate the idea of Purgatory and Limbo. Life after death but without an explanation about judgement being fully explained, created the need for purgatory, and Limbo for the innocent, such as babes in arms and the like. The older Apostles Creed states that Jesus was crucified, died, and on the third day was resurrected. See the difference? Theologically it is HUGE!! T This message has been edited.

The Nicean Creed states that Jesus was crucified,died and descended to hell, ascended and was resurrected on the third day. This to accomodate the idea of Purgatory and Limbo. Life after death but without an explanation about judgement being fully explained, created the need for purgatory, and Limbo for the innocent, such as babes in arms and the like. The older Apostles Creed states that Jesus was crucified, died, and on the third day was resurrected. See the difference? Theologically it is HUGE!! T This message has been edited.

Just because it's centuries old doesn't change the fact that it came from the minds of men. Even the alleged words of Jesus were written by people one or two generations removed from his time.

        "content": "No Steve, that's where you are wrong. For centuries mankind has relied on others telling them what the book means. With the advent of the reconstruction and then John and Charles Wesley there was a new movement to read ONLY what was in the book no interpreting \"what it really meant\" to conform with preconcieved dogma, but only what it said!! This is the mistake I made when I was confirmed as a Methodist at the tender age of not quite thirteen. After listening to our pastor make horrendous statements about Catholics and other denominations I bought and began to read the Bible sans interpreters, just like it was a book. I bought a concordance, and a Bible dictionary, and it took years till my mid twenties, but it was so easy to understand that way for me. Then I began to study with the Jehova's Witnesses for a couple of years and used their literal interpretation and compared it to mine and found that STILL there was some wierd stuff creeping in and I would point out to them where these points were. Didn't do any good....surprise!! When after about 1991 I really buckled down and formalized my commitment and then in 2002 totally commited to ministry and studied with mentors at the highest level I had yet engaged. I found my understandings almost perfectly in line with Wesleyan Theology. A few more years of study collecting my course hours from Duke from the early seventies, some judicious parlaying, a thesis, and then a disertation with it's defense and Viola, D.D. and Ordination. This is why I get in trouble on the threads so much with the more fundamental of us. I will not compromise and I have reason to believe that I am right. I will not discuss why I am convinced of that, but you have read enough of my stuff and no doubt, like Bill, have perused some of my writings from my blog and the T.P.O.A. site as well. So there's no need to belabor the point. Also the Center for Religious Tolerance has carried some of my maunderings as well. And, you have seen me present many times what you have stated. ALL the writings in the Bible have come through the filter of men's minds and the culture of their times and that must be taken into account when reading the book. I just wrote two days ago about this, on another thread. But it was once again my admonition to remember that the book is about people. The God part is easy to understand and is in fact, predictable, it is the part about the people and how they failed to learn what the true point of the book is...look inside your self and listen to the answers that you get as you consider what god wants of you. Very few indeed can do that, or even consider themselves in the naked light of day and accept themselves as they are, with no, shall we say, embellishment!! By the way, I have always thought you are one who can. As sharp as he is sometimes so is Bill and K.J. is without peer in self examination. Perhaps you have noticed others of no faith structure that have no problem with me either, I don't challenge or denigrate them for this they also serve who but live in the world!! That's in the \"Book\" too!! T",

Here's my \"Islamic\" take on the subject. God gave the revelation to man either through Prophets, Messengers, or Angels. Those men who heard the message and/or compiled it, did what they will. God is obviously fully capable of just giving the revelation Himself, as He did with the first set of commandments, but His pattern has been to give the revelation to man in order for man to use and obey. As Muslims, we believe that this was the pattern prior to the advent of the Qur'an i.e. the hands off approach, and that given mans reckless abandon and usage of the revelation God decided to reveal the Qur'an and guard it against corruption. Obviously this is a matter of Muslim faith that I don't accept non-Muslims to buy, but that is what we believe. We believe that the Qur'an the only religious text in which God directly states that He will guard it against corruption, is true, and we back that claim up with the fact that there exists only One Qur'an that all Muslims read and the fact that the scriptural, translation, and historical issues that plague other religious writ do not exist with the Qur'an at all. Now this point was not to diminish any text but more to expound on my beliefs. That being said, I believe Tawodi was on the mark, by in so many ways stating that it's not that God isn't capable, but that it was given to man as a sacred trust and man \"filtered\" it. The real debate is why did God choose to do it this way? and How accurate is the filter?",

Flightdirector... IMHO your father did what he was led to. Many, many times we find ourselves in organized religion arguing tradition over theology. We also make the mistake of treating others poorly due to not thinking like us. I especially have problems in classes that teach bible study with their traditional understanding as the only meaning of scripture. Your father understood this and did what he felt was proper and good. Again IMHO, he did what all Clergy is supposed to do; be Spirit led to accomplish the intentional will of God, even when circumstances temporarily alter that intention. Through His people He accomplishes His ultimate will. The redemption and salvation of man through the love of Christ. Jesus on \"Sectarianism\": John answered and said, \"Master we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.\" But Jesus said to him, \"Do not forbid him, for he who is not against us is on our side.\" It's not about traditions or denominations...

You and I have discussed this aspect of your father's ministry before and for many reasons which I outlined to you, he had my greatest respect for sticking to his convictions as a man and as a Pastor, in a place that did not appreciate him, or want him there. I have mentioned that some have said, I travel to the beat of a different drum. My rejoinder to this has been and will be, I have my own 76 piece band!! And the band leader is God not men!! We do rather nicely. ( except for when, like this morning, I screw it up!!) As C.J. says each of us MUST stay true to our selves and with the many and separate gifts we have each been given, serve as we are called. We can do no less. Some times it is rewarding, sometimes it is hell on earth. But the rewards are not to be found here, nor are they to come from men. As always we MUST answer to a higher power, after communing within and following that command, that only we can feel, in our hearts. From our many and varied exchanges, I know you are called in much the same way as your father and travel a path that not many understand or agree with, but which, when one looks, you are true to and diligent in continuing on with the perseverence that only the truly called can see or recognise in another, such as your self. Your persona has reveiled itself as a credit to you, your father and mother, and to all you have touched, in what I choose to call your ministry. May you have gathered with your family, rich in the blessing of memories and the strength that comes from such gatherings, yesterday on Easter. May you, and they, continue to be blessed by each other and the lord God, richly and with strength added to your burdens to see you through. May the peace of understanding attend you all, with the solace of the Salvation of Christ in your midst. Bruce",

He decides to destroy all humans, beasts, creeping things, fowls, and \"all flesh wherein there is breath of life.\" He plans to drown them all. 6:7, 17 God repeats his intention to kill \"every living substance ... from off the face of the earth.\" 7:4 God drowns everything that breathes air. From newborn babies to koala bears -- all creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned them all. 7:21-23 God sends a plague on the Pharaoh and his household because the Pharaoh believed Abram's lie. 12:17 God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless slaughter makes God feel better. 15:9-10 \"I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\" I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in Genesis 19. Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children. 18:32 God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah by raining \"fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.\" Well, almost everyone -- he spares the \"just and righteous\" Lot and his family. 19:24 Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 19:26 God threatens to kill Abimelech and his people for believing Abe's lie. 20:3-7 Sarai tells Abraham to \"cast out this bondwoman and her son.\" God commands him to \"hearken unto her voice.\" So Abraham abandons Hagar and Ishmael, casting them out into the wilderness to die. 21:10-14 God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham shows his love for God by his willingness to murder his son. But finally, just before Isaac's throat is slit, God provides a goat to kill instead. 22:2-13 Abraham shows his willingness to kill his son for God. Only an monster would ask a father to do that; only a bad father would be willing to do it. 22:10 \"The terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them.\" 35:5 \"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.\" What did Er do to elicit God's wrath? The Bible doesn't say. Maybe he picked up some sticks on Saturday. 38:7 After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to \"go in unto thy brother's wife.\" But \"Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew him also.\" This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 38:8-10 God brought a seven year, \"very greivous\" famine on the whole earth for no apparent reason (except maybe to make Joseph wealthy). 41:25-32, 54 These monstrous acts are in one book. Shall we do the rest?",

The confusion between these concepts is why protestants such as Methodists and others use the Apostles Creed instead of the Nicean Creed.

Life after death but without an explanation about judgement being fully explained, created the need for purgatory, and Limbo for the innocent, such as babes in arms and the like.

This is the mistake I made when I was confirmed as a Methodist at the tender age of not quite thirteen. After listening to our pastor make horrendous statements about Catholics and other denominations I bought and began to read the Bible sans interpreters, just like it was a book. I bought a concordance, and a Bible dictionary, and it took years till my mid twenties, but it was so easy to understand that way for me. Then I began to study with the Jehova's Witnesses for a couple of years and used their literal interpretation and compared it to mine and found that STILL there was some wierd stuff creeping in and I would point out to them where these points were. Didn't do any good....surprise!! When after about 1991 I really buckled down and formalized my commitment and then in 2002 totally commited to ministry and studied with mentors at the highest level I had yet engaged. I found my understandings almost perfectly in line with Wesleyan Theology. A few more years of study collecting my course hours from Duke from the early seventies, some judicious parlaying, a thesis, and then a disertation with it's defense and Viola, D.D. and Ordination. This is why I get in trouble on the threads so much with the more fundamental of us. I will not compromise and I have reason to believe that I am right. I will not discuss why I am convinced of that, but you have read enough of my stuff and no doubt, like Bill, have perused some of my writings from my blog and the T.P.O.A. site as well. So there's no need to belabor the point. Also the Center for Religious Tolerance has carried some of my maunderings as well. And, you have seen me present many times what you have stated. ALL the writings in the Bible have come through the filter of men's minds and the culture of their times and that must be taken into account when reading the book. I just wrote two days ago about this, on another thread. But it was once again my admonition to remember that the book is about people. The God part is easy to understand and is in fact, predictable, it is the part about the people and how they failed to learn what the true point of the book is...look inside your self and listen to the answers that you get as you consider what god wants of you. Very few indeed can do that, or even consider themselves in the naked light of day and accept themselves as they are, with no, shall we say, embellishment!! By the way, I have always thought you are one who can. As sharp as he is sometimes so is Bill and K.J. is without peer in self examination.

        "quote": "Originally posted by tawodi: Yes Limbo and meatless Fridays. A lot of my Catholic friends not having seen the encyclicals wondered, and still do, if the people who went to hell for eating meat on fridays, got a \"get out of jail card\" when that was declared!! The Papal encyclical declared that the previous understandings were from antiquity and found to be in error to support eternal life after death. Scripturally that is correct because Jesus said \"The dead are conscious of nothing\" so after you die you are conscious of nothing till the resurrection. Many believe this and when questioned about it, I explain it as remembering when you were a kid on a car trip and your parents told you go to sleep and when we get there we'll wake you up!! Well they did and you didn't know any time had elapsed.....remember that feeling?? well maybe that's what it's like. Jesus also said that those who believe on Him even though they die, shall not taste death. So, when you pass over, you go to be with Christ, if found worthy. If not, you wait for the \"White Throne judgement\". Not really that confusing, when explained scripturally, instead of attaching a whole bunch of denominational dogma. The confusion between these concepts is why protestants such as Methodists and others use the Apostles Creed instead of the Nicean Creed. The Nicean Creed states that Jesus was crucified,died and descended to hell, ascended and was resurrected on the third day. This to accomodate the idea of Purgatory and Limbo. Life after death but without an explanation about judgement being fully explained, created the need for purgatory, and Limbo for the innocent, such as babes in arms and the like.

Here's my \"Islamic\" take on the subject. God gave the revelation to man either through Prophets, Messengers, or Angels. Those men who heard the message and/or compiled it, did what they will. God is obviously fully capable of just giving the revelation Himself, as He did with the first set of commandments, but His pattern has been to give the revelation to man in order for man to use and obey. As Muslims, we believe that this was the pattern prior to the advent of the Qur'an i.e. the hands off approach, and that given mans reckless abandon and usage of the revelation God decided to reveal the Qur'an and guard it against corruption. Obviously this is a matter of Muslim faith that I don't accept non-Muslims to buy, but that is what we believe. We believe that the Qur'an the only religious text in which God directly states that He will guard it against corruption, is true, and we back that claim up with the fact that there exists only One Qur'an that all Muslims read and the fact that the scriptural, translation, and historical issues that plague other religious writ do not exist with the Qur'an at all. Now this point was not to diminish any text but more to expound on my beliefs. That being said, I believe Tawodi was on the mark, by in so many ways stating that it's not that God isn't capable, but that it was given to man as a sacred trust and man \"filtered\" it. The real debate is why did God choose to do it this way? and How accurate is the filter?",

From newborn babies to koala bears -- all creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned them all. 7:21-23 God sends a plague on the Pharaoh and his household because the Pharaoh believed Abram's lie. 12:17 God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless slaughter makes God feel better. 15:9-10 \"I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\" I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in Genesis 19. Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children. 18:32 God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah by raining \"fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.\" Well, almost everyone -- he spares the \"just and righteous\" Lot and his family. 19:24 Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 19:26 God threatens to kill Abimelech and his people for believing Abe's lie. 20:3-7 Sarai tells Abraham to \"cast out this bondwoman and her son.\" God commands him to \"hearken unto her voice.\" So Abraham abandons Hagar and Ishmael, casting them out into the wilderness to die. 21:10-14 God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham shows his love for God by his willingness to murder his son. But finally, just before Isaac's throat is slit, God provides a goat to kill instead. 22:2-13 Abraham shows his willingness to kill his son for God. Only an monster would ask a father to do that; only a bad father would be willing to do it. 22:10 \"The terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them.\" 35:5 \"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.\" What did Er do to elicit God's wrath? The Bible doesn't say. Maybe he picked up some sticks on Saturday. 38:7 After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to \"go in unto thy brother's wife.\" But \"Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew him also.\" This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 38:8-10 God brought a seven year, \"very greivous\" famine on the whole earth for no apparent reason (except maybe to make Joseph wealthy). 41:25-32, 54 These monstrous acts are in one book. Shall we do the rest?",
