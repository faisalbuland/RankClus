WOW! quote: ++http://www.thai-blogs.com/index.php/2006/03/24/stories_from_the_thai_press_06?blog=8 After Mr Wichai (Tao), aged 24, from Samut Songkram province, who earns his living by dealing in old goods, got married to gorgeous twins Ms Sirintara and Ms Thipawan 22, he vouched his sincerest \u2018equal love\u2019 for both of them! Mr Wichai, just yesterday, 23 March, got married in pompous ceremony to both twins simultaneously. On being interviewed by the Thai Rath reporters, Mr Wichai declared wholeheartedly, that he didn\u2019t see much problem in having to perform tiresome marital duties with two wives. In the engagement ceremony before the wedding, Mr Wichai successfully offered a dowry of eight baht of gold and 80,000 baht EACH for his lovely darlings. Both families celebrated the marriage with joy and were said to be delighted for the threesome. Mr Wichai told the press that he had been best of friends with his neighbouring twins since they were children. \u201cWhen I grew older, I would walk past their house each morning and try to decide for myself which one I fancied more, but it was darned impossible \u2013 I adored BOTH of them \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t decide, which one of them to chat up\u2026.!\u201d He went on to say \u201cFor three continuous years all three of us would go on dates together, until there was one day when I couldn\u2019t stand the frustration any longer and told them I love you and want to marry you BOTH\u201d The fortunate Mr Wichai, instead of getting a slap in the face, was overjoyed when both girls admitted to having sworn all along, that they wished to marry the same man! \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy at first, what with the neighbours gossiping, but our family sympathized, understood, and fully supported our mutual love for the one man\u201d the twins said. Mr Wichai arranged for his brides to live with him, in his family house after the wedding, and his mother has already proudly prepared TWO rooms for the newly-weds. Our reporters were just gagging to hear the response to this mouth-watering question \u201cAnd.... what are the sleeping arrangements Mr Wichai\u201d? to which he replied modestly with a beaming smile \u201cAbsolutely no problems! For the first three nights of the week, I will sleep with Ms Thipawan and the next three will be spent with Ms Sirintara. As for every Saturday, the three of us will sleep together\u201d Ms Sirintara finally told the press \u201cWhen my twin and I worked as assistant nurses, we promised each other that we would never leave each others side, and that our future husband would have to either take us both, or leave us\u201d \u201cAnyway, Mr Wichai is the perfect man \u2013 he neither smokes nor drinks!\u201d",
