After my tagteam divorce/severe accident in '04 followed by having to retire from a job I loved, I went into a four year self pity party and stayed in my cave for most of that time. My dad, mom, best friend, etc would call and I would not answer the phone. On the worst of times, I wouldn't even answer if I saw it was one of my sons. It wasn't out of anger towards any of them. I just wanted to be left alone. It was pretty pittiful looking back on it. Both my dad and my buddy Gary told me many times they were close to calling the police to check on me. It was wrong to put them through that but it's simply the way I was back then. Thank God my family didn't give up on me and I would have to say the turning point was late in '07 when by friend Gary kept on me to buy a motorcycle. We use to ride together all the time back in our high school days. I finally bought a couple of old Yamaha's from a guy on Ebay. I'll tell ya, that's what finally got me out of my shell. I guess I was just ready. The time I spent restoring them built my enthusiasm to be outside again and working on a project. Here's the end result for the first one. Still working on the second. Now, to answer your question as to if you feel they may hurt others, I'd have to say DEFINITELY get involved. I guess that goes for threatening to hurt themselves as well. I had the advantage of knowing that I didn't feel that way towards myself. I just wanted things to be back the way they were, me working a great job and feeling like I was doing something important.
