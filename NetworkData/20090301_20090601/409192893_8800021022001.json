Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year. VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered. Sky News' Washington correspondent Robert Nisbet said: \"The gunman barricaded himself in the house and in the exchange of fire, three officers were killed. Investigators outside the American Civic Association in Binghampton, New York State 13 Killed in New York State \"A man was arrested after the stand-off. His best friend told reporters he had rung to say 'I am going to die today'.\" The three dead officers have been named as Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Police said Kelly had been on the force for 14 years, and the other two for just two years. Another officer was shot in the hand, and a fifth broke his leg while climbing a fence. \"Our hearts and our prayers go out to the officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice,\" said police chief Nathan Harper. \"It's a very sad day for the city of Pittsburgh.\" He said the first officers were shot through the head as soon as they entered the house. Mr Harper said the motive for the shooting is not clear, but friends said the killer had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was planning to ban guns.

(AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

When a crazy \"left winger\" snaps he kills freedom for everyone. One is a quick bloody death, the other is a slow death of torture. I dont see the differance. You advocate that people who beleive in freedom, who hold the ideals that created this nation in high regard, sit back and watch as you and yours tear them down, destroy personal freedom, subjugate themselves to rule of savages, turn America from a land of freedom to a land of tyranny. I dont support what this guy did. The police are not our enemies. But if you expect to destroy this nation, then you have to expect casualties.",

Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year. VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered.

(AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year. VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered. Sky News' Washington correspondent Robert Nisbet said: \"The gunman barricaded himself in the house and in the exchange of fire, three officers were killed. Investigators outside the American Civic Association in Binghampton, New York State 13 Killed in New York State \"A man was arrested after the stand-off. His best friend told reporters he had rung to say 'I am going to die today'.\" The three dead officers have been named as Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Police said Kelly had been on the force for 14 years, and the other two for just two years. Another officer was shot in the hand, and a fifth broke his leg while climbing a fence. \"Our hearts and our prayers go out to the officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice,\" said police chief Nathan Harper. \"It's a very sad day for the city of Pittsburgh.\" He said the first officers were shot through the head as soon as they entered the house.

Adkisson of Powell, Tenn., on Sunday, July 27, 2008. Adkisson is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year. VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered. Sky News' Washington correspondent Robert Nisbet said: \"The gunman barricaded himself in the house and in the exchange of fire, three officers were killed. Investigators outside the American Civic Association in Binghampton, New York State 13 Killed in New York State \"A man was arrested after the stand-off. His best friend told reporters he had rung to say 'I am going to die today'.\" The three dead officers have been named as Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Police said Kelly had been on the force for 14 years, and the other two for just two years. Another officer was shot in the hand, and a fifth broke his leg while climbing a fence. \"Our hearts and our prayers go out to the officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice,\" said police chief Nathan Harper. \"It's a very sad day for the city of Pittsburgh.\" He said the first officers were shot through the head as soon as they entered the house. Mr Harper said the motive for the shooting is not clear, but friends said the killer had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was planning to ban guns.

They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year. VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered. Sky News' Washington correspondent Robert Nisbet said: \"The gunman barricaded himself in the house and in the exchange of fire, three officers were killed. Investigators outside the American Civic Association in Binghampton, New York State 13 Killed in New York State \"A man was arrested after the stand-off. His best friend told reporters he had rung to say 'I am going to die today'.\" The three dead officers have been named as Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Police said Kelly had been on the force for 14 years, and the other two for just two years. Another officer was shot in the hand, and a fifth broke his leg while climbing a fence. \"Our hearts and our prayers go out to the officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice,\" said police chief Nathan Harper. \"It's a very sad day for the city of Pittsburgh.\" He said the first officers were shot through the head as soon as they entered the house. Mr Harper said the motive for the shooting is not clear, but friends said the killer had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was planning to ban guns.

(AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year. VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered. Sky News' Washington correspondent Robert Nisbet said: \"The gunman barricaded himself in the house and in the exchange of fire, three officers were killed. Investigators outside the American Civic Association in Binghampton, New York State 13 Killed in New York State \"A man was arrested after the stand-off.

(AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

Adkisson of Powell, Tenn., on Sunday, July 27, 2008. Adkisson is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974.

Adkisson of Powell, Tenn., on Sunday, July 27, 2008. Adkisson is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

That thought is usually not even a valid one to begin with but for some reason, it resonates with them. They then build their life around it and do whatever it takes to make it true. This is where stalkers come from. Luckily, most of these fantisies are really harmless; the classic FBI, CIA, KGB is following, listening to me stuff. But every now and then, they get truly deadly because, frankly, while they may seem just a bit \"flaky\" and like \"sad-sacks\" to their friends, for the most part, ther're fairly invisable until the sh*t hits the fan. So, yes, listening to Rush, Glenn Beck, Ollie and company MIGHT well have set this guy off. And it certainly IS within reason that his psychotic break was triggered by an irrational fear of a gun ban being heavily ranted about by those people. G-d knows, if he was reading this website, he would have gotten that same impression so it's not an unreasonable assumption to make.",

Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them.

VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered. Sky News' Washington correspondent Robert Nisbet said: \"The gunman barricaded himself in the house and in the exchange of fire, three officers were killed.

Adkisson of Powell, Tenn., on Sunday, July 27, 2008. Adkisson is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

        "content": "Call lures police to ambush; gunman kills 3 at the door Associated Press Sunday, April 05, 2009 Pittsburgh \u2014- A man in a bulletproof vest killed three police officers answering a domestic call Saturday, police said. Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year.

        "reply": "Call lures police to ambush; gunman kills 3 at the door Associated Press Sunday, April 05, 2009 Pittsburgh \u2014- A man in a bulletproof vest killed three police officers answering a domestic call Saturday, police said. Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year.

(AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

Police Chief Nate Harper said the motive for the shooting isn\u2019t clear, but friends said the gunman recently had been upset about losing his job and feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns. Richard Poplawski, 23, met officers at the doorway, shot two in the head immediately and then killed an officer who tried to help them, Harper said. Harper said more than 100 rounds were fired when Poplawski, with an assault rifle and two other guns, held police off four hours as the fallen officers lay nearby. The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly had finished the night shift and was on his way home when he responded to the call. Another officer was shot in the hand and a fifth broke his leg on a fence. Poplawski had gunshot wounds only in his legs because of the bulletproof vest, Harper said. He was charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and a weapons violation. \u201cIt appears he was lying in wait for the officers,\u201d Harper said. Don Sand, who lives across the street from Poplawski, said he saw the first two officers go down and then saw Kelly get shot. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding,\u201d Sand said. \u201cBy the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late.\u201d Poplawski\u2019s best friend said Poplawski feared \u201cthe Obama gun ban that\u2019s on the way\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t like our rights being infringed upon.\u201d Edward Perkovic said Poplawski had called him at work and said, \u201cEddie, I am going to die today. \u2026 Tell your family I love them and I love you.\u201d Another friend, Joe DiMarco, said Poplawski had been laid off from his job at a glass factory earlier this year. VICTIMS The officers killed were Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III. Kelly was on his way home after finishing the night shift when he responded to the call. Three police officers have been killed and two injured after being called to a domestic disturbance in the latest shooting spree on America's streets. Police killed in Pittsburgh Three police officers were killed as they arrived at house The bloodshed comes just a day after a man shot dead 13 people at a community centre in New York state. In the latest shooting, a man wearing a bullet-proof vest opened fire as police arrived at a home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A four-hour stand-off followed during which the 23-year-old man shot at police dozens of times with a high-powered rifle. The man - named as Richard Poplawski - was eventually wounded in the gun battle and surrendered. Sky News' Washington correspondent Robert Nisbet said: \"The gunman barricaded himself in the house and in the exchange of fire, three officers were killed.

(AP Photo/Knoxville Police Department) By Beth Rucker, Associated Press Writer KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Children from the Unitarian church where authorities said an out-of-work truck driver shot and killed two people, ended a prayer vigil by singing a song from the musical the gunman interrupted. At the service Monday, which included candle-lighting and speeches by church leaders, the children came out singing, \"The sun will come out tomorrow,\" a line from the signature song in the musical \"Annie.\" Gunfire erupted Sunday during the children's performance at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, which authorities said Jim D. Adkisson intentionally targeted because of its congregation's liberal policies. A four-page letter found in Adkisson's SUV indicated he picked the church because, the police chief said, \"he hated the liberal movement.\" An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service at the Second Presbyterian Church next door. \"We're here tonight to make sense of the senseless,\" the Rev. William Sinkford, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, told the gathering.

Adkisson | Greg McKendry | Second Presbyterian Church | Linda Kraeger | Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Adkisson's ex-wife once belonged to the church but hadn't attended in years, said Ted Jones, the congregation's president. Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk declined to comment on whether investigators think the ex-wife's link was a factor in the attack. Adkisson, 58, who had been on the verge of losing his food stamps, remained jailed Monday on $1 million bond after being charged with one count of murder. More charges are expected. Four victims remained hospitalized, including two in critical condition. The attack Sunday morning lasted only minutes. But the anger behind it may have been building for months, if not years. \"It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job, his frustration over that, and his stated hatred for the liberal movement,\" Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said of Adkisson. A police affidavit used to get a search warrant for Adkisson's home said the suspect admitted to the shooting. Adkisson \"stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country,\" investigator Steve Still wrote. Adkisson was a loner who hates \"blacks, gays and anyone different from him,\" longtime acquaintance Carol Smallwood of Alice, Texas, told the Knoxville News Sentinel. Authorities said Adkisson's criminal record consisted of only two drunken driving citations. But court records reviewed by The Associated Press show that his former wife obtained an order of protection in March 2000 while the two were still married and living in the Knoxville suburb of Powell. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when Liza Alexander wrote in requesting the order that Adkisson threatened \"to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out.\" She told a judge she feared for her life. Calls to Alexander's home were not answered Monday, and the voice mailbox was full. In Adkisson's letter, which police have not released, \"he indicated ... that he expected to be in there (the church) shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police,\" Owen said. Witnesses said the attack was cut short after audience members tackled the gunman. The Unitarian-Universalist church advocates women's rights and gay rights and has provided sanctuary for political refugees. It also has fed the homeless and founded a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, according to its Web site. Adkisson told authorities he had no next of kin or family. He lived about a 20-minute drive from the Unitarian church -- one of three in the Knoxville area. The police chief said the suspect bought the shotgun at a pawn shop about a month ago, and he wrote the letter in the last week or so. A .38-caliber handgun was found in his home. About 200 people were watching 25 children perform when authorities said the suspect entered and fired three blasts from a semiautomatic shotgun. No children were hurt, but eight people were shot, including the two who died -- Greg McKendry, 60, and Linda Kraeger, 61. Jamie Parkey crawled under the pews with his daughter and mother when the second and third shots were fired. He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

He saw several men rush the suspect. \"I jumped up to join them,\" he told AP Television News. \"When I got there, they were already wrestling with him. The gun was in the air. Somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog-piled him to the floor. I knew a police suppression hold, and I sat on him until police came.\" Owen said police would not release several videos of the performance by audience members or Adkisson's letter until they have been analyzed for evidence. Adkisson, who faces his next court hearing Aug. 5, was on active duty with the Army beginning in 1974. Army records show he was a helicopter repairman, rising from a private to specialist and then returning to private before being discharged in late 1977. This message has been edited.

When a crazy \"left winger\" snaps he kills freedom for everyone. One is a quick bloody death, the other is a slow death of torture. I dont see the differance. You advocate that people who beleive in freedom, who hold the ideals that created this nation in high regard, sit back and watch as you and yours tear them down, destroy personal freedom, subjugate themselves to rule of savages, turn America from a land of freedom to a land of tyranny. I dont support what this guy did. The police are not our enemies. But if you expect to destroy this nation, then you have to expect casualties.",
