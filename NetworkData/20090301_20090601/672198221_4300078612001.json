Specifically, the PIC has no options on where he/she would like to land. They must head for the nearest safe landing zone... aka: for fixed wings, Nearest airfield that has a long enough runway. They have no other options. This accident apparently happened because the PIC didn't wish to be inconvenienced by landing at a remote site. Sounds as if he was more interested in not ruining his evening by awaiting secondary transportation home.

        "content": "Hey guys, don't shoot the messenger!... I just stated the conditions, as YOU all know that they are, rightly or wrongly!... I have personally downed for flight, aircraft that had three different sources stating that the aircraft was down and for safety items, that's SAFETY, as in crew safety systems and I had a maintenance chief literally tear the maintenance action forms off of his board and tear them up!... Initially I wrote them up as \"up\" gripes, after consulting with the pilots and flight crews, because of mission requirements at the time... I was hesitant to do so, as it was for missing bailout warning horns on the RA-3 aircraft... I had the Daily Turn Around Cards, Pilot's Walk Around Cards and the Maintenance Instruction Manuals, all state that if the pressure in the nitrogen bottles fell below a certain point, the aircraft was down till serviced... Well, the bottles and HORNS were all missing, after the aircraft returned from scheduled depot level maintenance... My first reaction, must be an airframes change but, there was nothing to indicate so... Seems depot, i.e. civilian contractor, had to remove the horns and bottles to access areas where they had to do maintenance and FORGOT, to reinstall the bottles and nobody seemed to notice, civilian civil service inspectors and Navy inspectors, that they were missing... The long and the short of it is, that if the escape doors on a RA-3 are blown, everyone knows it and everyone is gonna be leaving the aircraft, hence, UP Gripes!... It was taking a chance, because if there was an accident, incident and heaven forbid, someone injured or killed, heads would roll... They were the only aircraft capable of doing their mission on station and if they were DOWN, the whole Pacific Missile Test Center, came to a halt... When the maintenance chief tore up the gripes and never intended to reinstall the systems, I changed them all to DOWN gripes and reinstated them, BIG BLOW UP!!!... The maintenance chief took it as a \"pizzing contest\" and he, having more horse power than I, I said, fine!... If there was an incident, it was on his head, as I had documented all my actions, zerox machines are wonderful, as are Plane Captain Daily Turn Around Logs... They flew and so do many other military aircraft, when the \"mission\" requires it, in actuality, or in someone's mind or both... This, from the limited data that is available to me, sounds just like one of those situations... D@mned if you do, d@mned if you don't!... Your fitness report reflects your desire to NOT meet mission requirements, if you are an officer and your quarterly evaluations reflect it, if you are enlisted, such is the \"peace time\" military, even though there is a war going on... The old saw of, \"Accidents are a chain of events. Break the chain, anywhere and the accident doesn't happen!\", is true... This is a case of, in peoples minds, the mission justified the actions and PEOPLE DIED!... It's not right, it never is but, there it is... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 This message has been edited.

        "reply": "Hey guys, don't shoot the messenger!... I just stated the conditions, as YOU all know that they are, rightly or wrongly!... I have personally downed for flight, aircraft that had three different sources stating that the aircraft was down and for safety items, that's SAFETY, as in crew safety systems and I had a maintenance chief literally tear the maintenance action forms off of his board and tear them up!... Initially I wrote them up as \"up\" gripes, after consulting with the pilots and flight crews, because of mission requirements at the time... I was hesitant to do so, as it was for missing bailout warning horns on the RA-3 aircraft... I had the Daily Turn Around Cards, Pilot's Walk Around Cards and the Maintenance Instruction Manuals, all state that if the pressure in the nitrogen bottles fell below a certain point, the aircraft was down till serviced... Well, the bottles and HORNS were all missing, after the aircraft returned from scheduled depot level maintenance... My first reaction, must be an airframes change but, there was nothing to indicate so... Seems depot, i.e. civilian contractor, had to remove the horns and bottles to access areas where they had to do maintenance and FORGOT, to reinstall the bottles and nobody seemed to notice, civilian civil service inspectors and Navy inspectors, that they were missing...
