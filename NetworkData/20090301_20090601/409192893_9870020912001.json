Okay with the premise that i am 100 percent behind research into energy creation and efficient utilization; the man has some fundamental flaws If your consumption of energy is too high then there are many things you can do. No not going to list them but the list is large. And electric companies already have utilized this system to control during peak demands. and they on the whole have abandoned the practice. There used to be a system that during peak hours could monitor your heat/air pump and water heater and shut them down or back them off during peak hours. turned out to be pretty expensive to maintain and it just did not work, i had this system in my house for years.. Obama also said today that people would be able to sell surplus power with the new equipment, does anyone here have any idea how many solar panels are required to do something like this?? I do, I lived with solar panels and wind generators for ten years, and remember the system is directly porportional (more requires bigger!!) I say fund research but dont sell a pipe dream that everyone will have a little magic electronic box, a few solar panels and be energy dependant. aint gonna happen not at this time, nor in the near future either \"http://greenbydesign.com/2009/02/19/are-obama-and-google-stimulating-the-smart-energy-sector/\" here is some more information, this is not new technology and has been around for a long long time",

To make a statment such as the one you made is nothing more than an invalid and unproven link between two disconnected entities. For what purpose? To discredit the President? He may very well get on board with this idea, but how about we hold off condemning him for it until he actually does?",
