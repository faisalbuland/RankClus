I am not, nor ever was a policeman, I was however a certified security officer and a nuclear security officer. I have been trained to use a taser, and I have been tagged with them on two separate occassions, once per cert. My training was that the taser was the prefered non-leathal force medium. It went like this for the levels of force, voice commands, non-leathal force(in form of mace and taser depending on situation), deadly force. I was trained that grappling with someone was the least prefered method to use, ever, under any circumstances. Why? You do not know the intent or capabilities of a given individual. He may have a knife, gun, or other weapon. You move to man-handle a person and get stabbed, then you are done. It is on you, and a bullet resistant vest is of rather little help against a sharp object. I support the officer electing to use his taser on a suspect resisting arrest. It was the best option for minimal risk of severe harm to the officer and the suspect. Sadly, the suspect turned out to be guilty of nothing more than fear, and suffered death via means of a normally non-lethal device. That is regretable, however, I cannot say that I would have acted any differantly than the officer on the scene in the same situation. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake.

        "reply": "I see second guessing the man on the scene is still the order of the day. I am not, nor ever was a policeman, I was however a certified security officer and a nuclear security officer. I have been trained to use a taser, and I have been tagged with them on two separate occassions, once per cert. My training was that the taser was the prefered non-leathal force medium. It went like this for the levels of force, voice commands, non-leathal force(in form of mace and taser depending on situation), deadly force. I was trained that grappling with someone was the least prefered method to use, ever, under any circumstances. Why? You do not know the intent or capabilities of a given individual. He may have a knife, gun, or other weapon. You move to man-handle a person and get stabbed, then you are done. It is on you, and a bullet resistant vest is of rather little help against a sharp object. I support the officer electing to use his taser on a suspect resisting arrest. It was the best option for minimal risk of severe harm to the officer and the suspect. Sadly, the suspect turned out to be guilty of nothing more than fear, and suffered death via means of a normally non-lethal device. That is regretable, however, I cannot say that I would have acted any differantly than the officer on the scene in the same situation. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",

Well here in southern california they might be thinking they are going to get a bullet in the ass before anything else happens... It seems like we have an Officer involved shooting about every other week...I'm not criticizing because ALL of them(about 8-10 I think in the last 2 months)were justified... Got some idiots down here, and the cops aint playing with them There was one just last night....an off-duty officer was having dinner with his family at a Norms restraunt when it started to get robbed, he interrupted the robbery, the armed suspected with a knife lunged at him, and the suspect was dispatched...",

I am not, nor ever was a policeman, I was however a certified security officer and a nuclear security officer. I have been trained to use a taser, and I have been tagged with them on two separate occassions, once per cert. My training was that the taser was the prefered non-leathal force medium. It went like this for the levels of force, voice commands, non-leathal force(in form of mace and taser depending on situation), deadly force. I was trained that grappling with someone was the least prefered method to use, ever, under any circumstances. Why? You do not know the intent or capabilities of a given individual. He may have a knife, gun, or other weapon. You move to man-handle a person and get stabbed, then you are done. It is on you, and a bullet resistant vest is of rather little help against a sharp object. I support the officer electing to use his taser on a suspect resisting arrest. It was the best option for minimal risk of severe harm to the officer and the suspect. Sadly, the suspect turned out to be guilty of nothing more than fear, and suffered death via means of a normally non-lethal device. That is regretable, however, I cannot say that I would have acted any differantly than the officer on the scene in the same situation. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",
