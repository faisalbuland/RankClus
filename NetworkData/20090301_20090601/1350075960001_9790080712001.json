        "content": "The 56th Masonic District will host a U.S. Military (Active Duty in Uniform) night on 28 April 2009, at Kempsville Lodge No.196 located in Virginia Beach, VA. This annual event was started in 2004. To date, the 56th district has not been able to fully seat an active duty degree team with representatives from all branches of the US Military. We currently have active duty representatives of the USN, USAF, USCG seated. We are in need of US Marine Corp and US Army Masonic Brethren to assist in conferring an EA Degree on a fellow active duty service member. Should this request find it's way onto the screen of a Brother willing to assist or simply attend, please contact the WM via the lodges website at //kempsvillelodge.org// This message has been edited.
