I think folks forgot about New Orleans was practically TOTALLY out of commission for over a year. That alone displaced over 400-thousand jobs. All of those situations cost us an enormous amount of money. I believe we are about to lose our triple A rating. Even if Obama can pressure them to make it only temporary \u2013 that is going blow the bottom out. Businesses have yet to feel the tax increases he\u2019s imposed and reduced the write-offs. I also don\u2019t believe businesses are going to trust this gov. They will begin pulling out as has already started happening. It is impossible for decent business to operate in this country under Obama\u2019s full blown plans. They were expecting unemployment to drop several points by now. This is summer \u2013 everything should up and running but it isn\u2019t. I also wouldn\u2019t doubt that those who were working for Chrysler & GM who were laid off and/or while it was shut down \u2013 I doubt any of those numbers are incorporated into the numbers we\u2019re hearing. China & Chavez are trying to push for a new global currency. Sadly, there isn\u2019t a damn democrat in congress or the administration who has ever actually OWNED a real business. All they know is textbook bs and that is a recipe for bankruptcy. I don\u2019t see this taking too long. The 6-million people unemployed now will have their benefits cutoff right around Christmas. Thus far everything I\u2019ve been reading on the 2010-2011 budgets for businesses \u2013 it is NOT good. They\u2019ve already written off this year and 2010.

The problem is \u2013 that\u2019s exactly when his taxes start kicking in AND Bush\u2019s expire \u2013 plus the additional write-offs disappear \u2013 charitable donations \u2013 and even residential mortgage interest is no longer tax deductable. The new snack tax, soda tax will go into affect then the TWO REAL BIGGIES \u2013 Fuel tax 1.50 per gallon above what the fed is taking already \u2013 the next whopper is the freaking energy tax.

The FED does NOT \u201cearn\u201d its money \u2013 it TAKES it from THOSE who earn it. If those who earn it do NOT have it, the FED dries up. THAT is what is happening. That is why unemployment continues to rise. Obama was counting on unemployment to drop back to 5.5 to 6 by now. We are approaching summer \u2013 this country traditionally starts ROLLING in the bucks by now \u2013 the SURGE starts showing \u2013 but instead unemployment is over 10% and rising FAST\u2026 That means none of those people are now paying anything \u2013 NO TAXES and are DRAWING money from the system. I hope I am wrong \u2013 but I don\u2019t think so\u2026 We are in for some DEEP \u2013 DEEP hard times\u2026 He screwed up and screwed BIG and there is no turning it around now.",

According to noted investment advisor Peter Schiff, in a recent interview, he said we (USA) are financing an increasing amount of our debt with short term bonds instead of locking in long term rates. If rates spike our interest payments will spike. To put this in the worst possible light, 22% of our tax revenue goes to debt interest - if rates on the debt doubled (because the short term bonds will mature soon and new ones will be sold to pay back the old - basically government \u201crefinancing\u201d), assuming we didn\u2019t add or subtract any debt, our interest payments would be 44% of tax revenue!!!!! In Bush's worst time the deficit consumed 8% and it was making everyone extremely nervous... Last I heard Obama was pegging 13% and climbing. We haven't even begun to tap the inflation buttons yet. Those will start triggering right around Christmas and after that - things will start getting worse. Unemployment is tapping 10% - It will hit 15-18 before the year is out. The jobs Obama is creating are NOT the jobs being lost and what little they do create will not even begin to raise the revenue he will need to pay the debt. He is running everything bassawkards... The debt payments will be higher and climbing every month because he is borrowing more to pay each payment - THEN at the same time less & less people are working so the revenues are steadily dropping. His reaction is to RAISE taxes but that will NOT help. In 5yrs the DEBT payment alone will consume 50% of ALL the money the fed brings in - 50% of ALL - they were screaming at 8% - Obama is already tapping 13% - and we cannot pay it now. What is he going to do other than crank up the printing presses..?",

        "reply": " I hear what you're saying... However \"that\" is part of the problem - everyone keeps saying the US has \"never\" faulted on a loan. Well, that's partly because we had the work force to produce the revenue - AND - we had the industries to pay the work force. Right NOW - we have NETHER and what little we do have is pulling out - shutting down - going under...but here's a small snip from on economist... Google the guys name - these are smart people without and ax to grind. THEY ARE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED... \"...If rates rise, it will have harmful effects on not only us but also our foreign creditors.
