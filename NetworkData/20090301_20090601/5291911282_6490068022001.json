It was a very different atmosphere there today as the Conservatives in the State were voicing their displeasure over the debacle happening in Washington D.C. This was quite different than the usual Liberal Protests I had seen growing there in the last eight years. I even got to change my address on a new Voter Registration card. Some pictures of the event. Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
