Never mind the raping, did The Man make him do that? I always ask, people are so fast to protest police, but never the criminals...is it cowardice because they know the police won't react, while the criminal will beat their as*es? I ask the same of people that protest Israel yet not Muslim terrorists. Cause Terrorists will hunt them down and cut off their heads!!

The first person to throw a yellow card gets a broken beer bottle over the cranium. ..with all do respect... So what's got yer gripe up??!! I do dislike the neighbor's barking dog, but other than that, it's been a pretty nice day (for once). Not much I can do about the Bail Out Mess. Wish they'd shoot a couple of them. Am really tired of seeing them arrest one car load of Mexican Gangsters after another following robberies and drive by shootings, but nobody dares state the obvious: It is Mexicans that are causing all the robberies and drive by shootings!! They have the media so intimidated into political correctness that everybody is expected to put the blinders on - - So, I mind my own business, keep a loaded .45 1911A1 on my hip - and wait - - - Well, right now my local gripe is that I have back neighbors that are either drunk or Smokin'Pot right in the back yard. So, I had a 4 ft picket fence installed on three sides and a 6ft privacy on the back. As while practicing baseball with my son and growing our own Victory Garden he isn't directly exposed. As even his 7 year old nose realized something was up. So here's to all the dead beats getting high on my dime (money not bag) while probably blaming people like me for all their troubles....as they sit doing nothing with their lives. And I keep a loaded pistol myself and looking for a nice shotgun.",
