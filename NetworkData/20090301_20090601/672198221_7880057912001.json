Easy. If there was ANY evidence at all to arrest and detain them, use that evidence to prosecute them. If there was no evidence to arrest and detain them let them go. be done with it. Why is that so hard? BTW, you know as well as I do we have placed people in prison for a heck of a lot less than this. The is a Bush mess that he pawned off on the next guy...that's all it is.",

The only thing I acknowledged was my view on this matter and that Obama's policy is in line with Bush. as per the article. I understand how people feel about these crazys, but we should never allow our constitution to be compromised. Once you start allowing your government to do that, guess who is next on the list? If Hitler had succeeded in cleaning all the jews out, do you not think he would not have had a \"next\" on his list? I am certain he would have or did even, without really knowing for sure.
