Mr. Obama made the comments Saturday, the second day of the three-day summit in Trinidad and Tobago. Just before a separate meeting with South American leaders, Mr. Obama told reporters he looked forward to productive meetings to determine how the region can work together more effectively. Before cameras were ushered out of the room, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, an old U.S. adversary, walked over to President Obama, handed him a book and shook his hand. Reporters in the room say the book was entitled \"The Open Veins of Latin America,\" and is about Latin America's exploitation by foreign powers. On Friday, Mr. Chavez and Mr. Obama shook hands and Mr. Chavez is reported to have told the U.S. president \"I want to be your friend.\" President Obama on Friday called for a new beginning in relations between the United States and Cuba - a country not represented at the summit. Cuban President Raul Castro has said Havana is prepared to discuss any issue with Washington. The United States has lifted restrictions on travel and money transfers by Cuban-Americans to the island, but not the trade embargo. The head of the Organization of American States, Jose Miguel Insulza, says he will ask his group to re-admit Cuba at the next OAS General Assembly meeting this June in Honduras.

Maybe now they will be willing to listen to reason and meet us in the middle. I do not want it it end up as giving them all they want and us not getting anything in return. I would much rather try a two way street than to have China, Russia and Iran setting up in our back yard neighbor's yard while we remain hostile towards them. I just hope it doesn't turn out as it did when Clinton tried opening the door.",

And all this time I thought it was the military that made those types of decision. aggie_swife, Please do not put words in my post. I did not say \"Obama decided how to handle the pirates\". As was reported by the world-wide news media, stated by the Secretary Gates and others, the President \"authorized the military to take immediate action if the ship's captain's life was in danger\". That is considerably different than President Obama personally deciding \"how to handle the pirates\". He gave the military the authorization to proceed as necessary. Jack Jack, I merely read what you wrote, and it sounded as though credit was given to the president. Was this any different than when President Bush was in office? Does the military not have authority to make this type of decision? \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",
