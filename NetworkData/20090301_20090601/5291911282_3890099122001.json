        "content": "Because a \"not characterized\" discharge is an unsavory discharge, where an RE-1 is an honorable discharge. I don't mean that to be offensive, but it is the truth. The military threw \"you\" out (in quotes because \"you\" is generic, ie: not you yourself, but anyone reading that the description fits). Why would they want to give anyone yet another chance over someone that served their contract honorably? An RE-3 discharge is little different than a dishonorable discharge - it is simply not specified under an article 32/90 hearing. With that said, it is not impossible to reenlist with an RE-3. It is \"not characterized,\" meaning that it could be egregious, like theft or drug abuse; or it could be like the story I just read where an 11.5 year veteran was released by his NG unit for a civilian job in another state, only to find out later that they charged him with failure to report. The former examples prove a lack of proper judgment and warrant the RE-3. The latter, however, illustrates how the military can and does screw up when the lines of communication get convoluted. Not that you asked, but here is my advice: Ask yourself why you received the discharge you did (if you are asking for yourself). People make mistakes. God knows that I made my fair share of them - I just avoided getting caught; I do not stand in judgment. Are you REALLY a changed man? If so, then that victory needs to be touted loudly to the military. But if not, then perhaps military life just isn't your cup of tea. There's no shame in that. It's not that the military WON'T accept an RE-3. It's just that they usually don't because few people learn from their mistakes and are bound to repeat them. If you KNOW you will not repeat your previous errors, then all you have to do is prove that to the board. Explain to them HONESTLY all the nuances and details of the administrative separation and how you have personally changed so that they have a become a lesson learned in what not to do. A man's true sincerity takes little to prove, as it exudes from him like sweat on a hot day - naturally. You have my best wishes and my prayers, my friend! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
