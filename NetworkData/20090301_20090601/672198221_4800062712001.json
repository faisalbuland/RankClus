With the mixture of Democrat and Republicans over the past 25 years, there is plenty of blame to go around. Reagan sought to put Social Insecurity onto a better financial footing and established a bi-partisan commission, including very honest and respected Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D, New York).

Had the jackass Congress not voted in the late 1960s or early 1970s to be able to take FICA funds and drop IOUs into the \"trust fund,\" the reckoning would have been delayed a while, but it would have arrived by now, anyway. To help keep \"the system\" solvent, Reagan began taxing Social Insecurity payments. That, of course, slowed down the rate of depletion of surpluses. Clinton did not change Social Insecurity. He tried, but pachyderms in Congress would not go along. Bush tried, too, but jackasses in Congress would not. And what did we hear and read of Hillary and Obama with regard to Social Insecurity during the campaign last year? Their abject dishonesty and election-over-truth treatment of Americans with regard to the generational Ponzi scheme compelled them to tells us that there was nothing wrong with the system as it stands. Read their comments during the campaign. They knew full well that was a lie; if they did not know that, then they are among the dumbest dingbats in American guvmint. One of the biggest threats to Social Insecurity--or any retirement opportunities--is a poor economy. Without prosperity, upon which the obamanation wages war with polytickle-control-over-economic-freedom policies, no system matters a squat; all will be compromised. Those who claim that Social Insecurity should remain a completely guvmint-controlled program, so payments shall remain no matter what, are lying or ignorant. Without private-sector growth, the rest of \"the system\" falls miserably apart. One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered. To buy votes, over the years the polytishuns, especially jackasses but also pachyderms, have irresponsibly enabled people to draw much more, much sooner in benefits than they ever put in. That has hurt the rest of us who will barely see a 1% return on investment; my kids will see a -1% return on investment. When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s. That one change would have a GREAT effect on the solvency of the system as it is. Although it is about 20 years old, the book by Dorcas Hardy, Social Insecurity, is generally (not in all details) as relevant now as it was in the early days of GHW Bush's presidency.

Their abject dishonesty and election-over-truth treatment of Americans with regard to the generational Ponzi scheme compelled them to tells us that there was nothing wrong with the system as it stands. Read their comments during the campaign. They knew full well that was a lie; if they did not know that, then they are among the dumbest dingbats in American guvmint. One of the biggest threats to Social Insecurity--or any retirement opportunities--is a poor economy. Without prosperity, upon which the obamanation wages war with polytickle-control-over-economic-freedom policies, no system matters a squat; all will be compromised. Those who claim that Social Insecurity should remain a completely guvmint-controlled program, so payments shall remain no matter what, are lying or ignorant. Without private-sector growth, the rest of \"the system\" falls miserably apart. One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered. To buy votes, over the years the polytishuns, especially jackasses but also pachyderms, have irresponsibly enabled people to draw much more, much sooner in benefits than they ever put in. That has hurt the rest of us who will barely see a 1% return on investment; my kids will see a -1% return on investment. When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s. That one change would have a GREAT effect on the solvency of the system as it is. Although it is about 20 years old, the book by Dorcas Hardy, Social Insecurity, is generally (not in all details) as relevant now as it was in the early days of GHW Bush's presidency. It is worth reading, if this subject really matters to you. Wall Street is a much bigger ponzi scheme than the federal government is. Social Security would be fully funded now and for DECADES to come if is wasn't for the looting (now IOUs). Just imagine if Bush had succeeded in his attempt at privatizing part of Social Security - where would all that money be now? In some banker or corporate CEO's pockets no doubt. If you're so anti-government Social Security - I take it you want pensions totally privatized? Maybe you'd like to invest all your military retirement in the private sector too? Maybe the military should have that option. You can just hope your retirement doesn't come right after another economic bubble burst.",

With the mixture of Democrat and Republicans over the past 25 years, there is plenty of blame to go around.

To help keep \"the system\" solvent, Reagan began taxing Social Insecurity payments. That, of course, slowed down the rate of depletion of surpluses. Clinton did not change Social Insecurity. He tried, but pachyderms in Congress would not go along. Bush tried, too, but jackasses in Congress would not. And what did we hear and read of Hillary and Obama with regard to Social Insecurity during the campaign last year? Their abject dishonesty and election-over-truth treatment of Americans with regard to the generational Ponzi scheme compelled them to tells us that there was nothing wrong with the system as it stands.

Those who claim that Social Insecurity should remain a completely guvmint-controlled program, so payments shall remain no matter what, are lying or ignorant. Without private-sector growth, the rest of \"the system\" falls miserably apart. One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered. To buy votes, over the years the polytishuns, especially jackasses but also pachyderms, have irresponsibly enabled people to draw much more, much sooner in benefits than they ever put in. That has hurt the rest of us who will barely see a 1% return on investment; my kids will see a -1% return on investment. When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s. That one change would have a GREAT effect on the solvency of the system as it is. Although it is about 20 years old, the book by Dorcas Hardy, Social Insecurity, is generally (not in all details) as relevant now as it was in the early days of GHW Bush's presidency.

Those who claim that Social Insecurity should remain a completely guvmint-controlled program, so payments shall remain no matter what, are lying or ignorant. Without private-sector growth, the rest of \"the system\" falls miserably apart. One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered. To buy votes, over the years the polytishuns, especially jackasses but also pachyderms, have irresponsibly enabled people to draw much more, much sooner in benefits than they ever put in. That has hurt the rest of us who will barely see a 1% return on investment; my kids will see a -1% return on investment. When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s. That one change would have a GREAT effect on the solvency of the system as it is. Although it is about 20 years old, the book by Dorcas Hardy, Social Insecurity, is generally (not in all details) as relevant now as it was in the early days of GHW Bush's presidency. It is worth reading, if this subject really matters to you. Wall Street is a much bigger ponzi scheme than the federal government is. Social Security would be fully funded now and for DECADES to come if is wasn't for the looting (now IOUs). Just imagine if Bush had succeeded in his attempt at privatizing part of Social Security - where would all that money be now? In some banker or corporate CEO's pockets no doubt. If you're so anti-government Social Security - I take it you want pensions totally privatized? Maybe you'd like to invest all your military retirement in the private sector too? Maybe the military should have that option. You can just hope your retirement doesn't come right after another economic bubble burst.",

Their abject dishonesty and election-over-truth treatment of Americans with regard to the generational Ponzi scheme compelled them to tells us that there was nothing wrong with the system as it stands.

To help keep \"the system\" solvent, Reagan began taxing Social Insecurity payments. That, of course, slowed down the rate of depletion of surpluses. Clinton did not change Social Insecurity. He tried, but pachyderms in Congress would not go along. Bush tried, too, but jackasses in Congress would not. And what did we hear and read of Hillary and Obama with regard to Social Insecurity during the campaign last year? Their abject dishonesty and election-over-truth treatment of Americans with regard to the generational Ponzi scheme compelled them to tells us that there was nothing wrong with the system as it stands.

One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered.

When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s.

Social Security would be fully funded now and for DECADES to come if is wasn't for the looting (now IOUs). Just imagine if Bush had succeeded in his attempt at privatizing part of Social Security - where would all that money be now? In some banker or corporate CEO's pockets no doubt. If you're so anti-government Social Security - I take it you want pensions totally privatized? Maybe you'd like to invest all your military retirement in the private sector too? Maybe the military should have that option. You can just hope your retirement doesn't come right after another economic bubble burst.",

Without prosperity, upon which the obamanation wages war with polytickle-control-over-economic-freedom policies, no system matters a squat; all will be compromised. Those who claim that Social Insecurity should remain a completely guvmint-controlled program, so payments shall remain no matter what, are lying or ignorant. Without private-sector growth, the rest of \"the system\" falls miserably apart. One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered. To buy votes, over the years the polytishuns, especially jackasses but also pachyderms, have irresponsibly enabled people to draw much more, much sooner in benefits than they ever put in. That has hurt the rest of us who will barely see a 1% return on investment; my kids will see a -1% return on investment. When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s. That one change would have a GREAT effect on the solvency of the system as it is. Although it is about 20 years old, the book by Dorcas Hardy, Social Insecurity, is generally (not in all details) as relevant now as it was in the early days of GHW Bush's presidency. It is worth reading, if this subject really matters to you.", 
        "reply": " Wall Street is a much bigger ponzi scheme than the federal government is. Social Security would be fully funded now and for DECADES to come if is wasn't for the looting (now IOUs). Just imagine if Bush had succeeded in his attempt at privatizing part of Social Security - where would all that money be now? In some banker or corporate CEO's pockets no doubt. If you're so anti-government Social Security - I take it you want pensions totally privatized? Maybe you'd like to invest all your military retirement in the private sector too? Maybe the military should have that option. You can just hope your retirement doesn't come right after another economic bubble burst.",

It was LBJ who found that funding the Vietnam war was becoming politically embarrasing, and who changed the rules and made the SSI funds part of the General Budget. While my memory is not great, for some reason this change, AND the promises of Congressional Leaders (\"We would never, ever dream of compromising SSI Funds, this is just a 'bookeeping arrangement.' Trust us, would we lie to you?\") really stuck. But there is actually a very simple fix to the whole problem. Right now SSI contributions are capped at around 90k.

To help keep \"the system\" solvent, Reagan began taxing Social Insecurity payments. That, of course, slowed down the rate of depletion of surpluses. Clinton did not change Social Insecurity.

And what did we hear and read of Hillary and Obama with regard to Social Insecurity during the campaign last year?

One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered.

When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s.

Simply raise that to 250K and the entire problem disappears. ________________________________________________ The Social Security Cap is now $102,000 a year. Obama has proposed raising it but of course the economists and conservative think tanks are all already screaming bloody murder - saying that it will place an \"unfair burden\" on higher income taxpayers.",

To help keep \"the system\" solvent, Reagan began taxing Social Insecurity payments. That, of course, slowed down the rate of depletion of surpluses. Clinton did not change Social Insecurity.

One of the biggest reasons Social Insecurity is so tenuous is the ridiculous logic behind establishment of the age at which benefits are offered.

When the life expectancy of people advances 10 years from the 65 years it was, when Social Insecurity was established in the 1930s, and the age at which people can draw benefits stays the same or even diminishes, we KNOW we have a logical disconnect. Unless sick, people should be expected to work to age 70 or even 72, either of which is a lower age nowadays than age 65 was in the 1930s.

Actually Sweetie, had it been approved, a very small percentage of the money paid SS would have gone into the market ... and then only for people who opted for it and had a reasonable investment horizon remaining before retirement. Those same people would also benefit from dollar cost averaging as the market ultimately recovers. I wish it had been enacted ... and that I were young enough to have participated. As to raising the SS cap, while I have no fundamental problem with eliminating the cap altogether, POTUS 44 has proposed creating a donut for mid-to upper middle class payees on which their incomes would not be taxed (102K - 250K as I recall though the range may have changed).

Oh, yes, some in Chile came out winners, others are literally homeless and are unable to find enough to eat. SSI succeds because it involves everyone. It's a National last ditch \"insurance\" against total paupery. Allowing the ability to \"opt\" out would destroy the concept. It's the most successful social program in US history.
