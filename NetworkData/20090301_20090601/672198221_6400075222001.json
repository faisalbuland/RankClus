The Associated Press obtained a copy of a letter from the Justice Department informing two members of Congress that a key deadline in the inquiry expired Monday. The inquiry has become a politically-loaded guessing game, with some advocating criminal charges against the lawyers, and others urging the matter be dropped. The letter did not indicate what the findings of the final report will be. Jay Bybee, John Yoo, and Steven Bradbury worked in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and played key roles in crafting the legal justification for techniques critics call torture. UPDATE 2:30 PM ET: The Washington Post reports that former Bush administration officials are \"launching a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign\" to urge Obama Justice officials to \"soften\" the ethics report on the torture memo authors. The Post also reports that a 200-page draft report of the memo, prepared in January before President Bush's departure, \"recommends disciplinary action by state bar associations against two former department attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel who might have committed misconduct in preparing and signing the so-called torture memos. State bar associations have the power to suspend a lawyer's license to practice or impose other penalties.\" >http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/05/torture-memo-probe-by-doj_n_196781.html< The great speckled bird of the galaxy is about to roost on Jay Bybee's planet.

Setting aside that my friend Mike Isikoff reported this back in February, the flurry of reporting is baffling for another reason: It appears John Yoo cannot be disciplined or disbarred for writing those memos, even if the Office of Professional Responsibility says it has evidence he should be. That\u2019s because OPR\u2019s five-year investigation\u2014carefully timed for release only as Bush was leaving the White House and Obama was coming in\u2014dragged on too long. As a result of that timing, OPR blew the deadline for referring possible misconduct allegations against Yoo. John Yoo is admitted to the bar in Pennsylvania. But the Pennsylvania Disciplinary Board, which would investigate any complaints against him, imposes a four-year limitation for complaints. Yoo wrote the memos in 2002 and 2003. This is 2009. You do the math....... ......And what about Bybee? Now a federal appeals court judge, Bybee is admitted in DC and Nevada\u2014those jurisdictions don\u2019t have comparable limitations periods. But how strange would it be to only refer Bybee, when his involvement largely amounted making a few edits and signing Yoo\u2019s legal work? Then there\u2019s the report itself. The bar for disciplinary action is incredibly high. Legal ethics experts, like Geoffrey Hazard at the University of Pennyslvania, say they expect nothing to happen, even if the state disciplinary boards were to investigate. Hazard says Yoo and Bybee have a number of strong available defenses, and that it\u2019s awfully hard to say the memo was so \u201coutside the range of plausible lawyered judgment that no reasonable lawyer could render it.\u201d Without that, he says, there\u2019s no ethical violation.",
