Robert Brown is apparently among them. Brown, D-Macon, said Wednesday he\u2019s not sure whether he actually owes the state or federal government any money because he hasn\u2019t filed tax returns. He said he\u2019s gotten extensions, but he declined to give more information or say for what years he received filing extensions. He told Atlanta station WXIA-TV that he had not filed his income taxes at least in the past two years, according to a report on the station\u2019s Web site. He volunteered the information while arguing against a change in Senate rules that would make it easier for the body to take action against, or even expel, members who don\u2019t pay their taxes. That effort came in response to the discovery late last week that 19 legislators had failed to pay income taxes, some for several years. Those legislators have not been identified, due to Georgia Department of Revenue and federal Internal Revenue Service privacy policies. But a list, without names, was prepared and given to the chairmen of the House and Senate ethics committees, at their request, Revenue Commissioner Bart Graham said. Graham said Wednesday that the list has grown to 22, with three of the legislators actually having liens levied against them or wages garnished so taxes could be collected.
