No one has better access to intelligence than the White House, and they deliberately manipulated the facts to get congress to approve actions when they had already decided to go to war. Note that the political winds didn't change w/r/t Iraq until a number of events occurred: 1. The depth of outright incompetence that became the trademark of the Bush Administration became apparent. 2. The quantities of lies told by the administration to all that would listen to goad the nation into accepting war were realized. 3. Virtually none of the major reasons for going to war turned out to be true (note how many times the reasons changed). Were you one of the complainers when G W Bush couldn't find a spending bill too outrageous to veto for the first 6 years of his lamentable administration? I was!!! It took the democrats finally taking over the agenda (with too small of a majority to have any other power) to create a budget that he would veto. Now that 8 years of horrify incompetence have left our nation but a shell of what it used to be, now the republicans finally start complaining about the budget. Its too late for them. They have all but evaporated as a party and now resort to buffoonery when attempting to argue a point. As an example, look at the 18-page alternative budget they came up with: it is 99.999% content free for your protection, with nary a single digit referencing dollars throughout. At least they provide some comic relief... But even Arlen Spector has had enough: He is about to announce that he is resigning his republican affiliation to become a member of the democratic party. It is reported that the republican party has swung so far to the right that it is now the wrong party for him. Alright where to begin? So basically what your telling me is the the Dems are so incompetant they didn't question the admin? If so, why do people continue to support these same people? If I could provide links I could show you the list of Dem supporters that also believed there were WMD, a former president who made a speach declaring Iraq had WMD. This was also believed by numerous intelligence agencies across the globe, the UK being just 1, did Bush cook up some grand conspiracy and get these other countries on board with us and his war? Doubtful, it might just be that everyone actually thought he had WMD. Please provide the proof that the WH or the admin deliberatly manipulated the facts. If he lied as you say how come no court has proven this or even taken up the case? A Spanish judge just threw a war crimes case out. You have absolutely no proof the admin lied to go to war. That is a left ideology that has no legs to support it. If he knowingly lied about going to war, how come he isn't up on war crimes, or even members of his admin? Why isn't the new president going after the former admin? Since when has Arlen Spector been a conservative? Maybe a R but no conservative. He is really a poor example to use in this debate. The R party is dead rhetoric is hardly new, the D's were scrambling in \"00\" and \"04\". After Nixon everyone thought the R party was a thing of the past. I was one of those outraged at Bushes liberal spending policies, but does that make it OK for Obama to continue the trend? What will your excuse for Obama be if he spends us into a depression? You can only blame Bush for so long! All of these politicos were duped by Bush I guess? \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region.

        "quote": "Originally posted by ryerye13B: quote: quote: Originally posted by ryerye13B: \"but decided somewhere along the line that it would be far more fun (if not oil-licious) to go for an uninvited visit into Iraq.\" Ah yes the lefts favorite tag-line, \"war for oil\", kinda like \"Bush let the Bin Ladens leave on Sept 11th, the only flight out.\" Let us not forget that all of our favorite Dems jumped on board for this excursion, funny how when the political winds changed those same Dems jumped ship. I wonder if people will still be singing the presidents praise when this country is so far in debt, because of his outta control spending, our great great grandchildren will be picking up the tab? Please spare me the \"Bush did it\" argument, I'm no Bush apologist or supporter so if you reply with this argument it falls on deaf ears! I am fully aware of what Bush did! And Yes he is making the same mistakes as Hoover and FDR! Carbon Tax anyone? Maybe another trillion to those who are mostly responsible for this mess will turn it around? Bill-Fold while your learning a few their history please include how we, as a country, recovered from the depression? I'll give ya a hint WWII. This recession is not worse than the Great Depression, at least not yet! Obama is just another politician. The Dems jumped aboard that excursion because they were carefully fed highly focused, bogus, biased, cooked, and otherwise highly suspect intelligence from sources the administration were warned to be pathologically dishonest by our allies intelligence agencies (and in a number of notable cases, our own CIA). No one has better access to intelligence than the White House, and they deliberately manipulated the facts to get congress to approve actions when they had already decided to go to war. Note that the political winds didn't change w/r/t Iraq until a number of events occurred: 1. The depth of outright incompetence that became the trademark of the Bush Administration became apparent. 2. The quantities of lies told by the administration to all that would listen to goad the nation into accepting war were realized. 3. Virtually none of the major reasons for going to war turned out to be true (note how many times the reasons changed). Were you one of the complainers when G W Bush couldn't find a spending bill too outrageous to veto for the first 6 years of his lamentable administration? I was!!! It took the democrats finally taking over the agenda (with too small of a majority to have any other power) to create a budget that he would veto. Now that 8 years of horrify incompetence have left our nation but a shell of what it used to be, now the republicans finally start complaining about the budget. Its too late for them. They have all but evaporated as a party and now resort to buffoonery when attempting to argue a point. As an example, look at the 18-page alternative budget they came up with: it is 99.999% content free for your protection, with nary a single digit referencing dollars throughout. At least they provide some comic relief... But even Arlen Spector has had enough: He is about to announce that he is resigning his republican affiliation to become a member of the democratic party. It is reported that the republican party has swung so far to the right that it is now the wrong party for him. Alright where to begin? So basically what your telling me is the the Dems are so incompetant they didn't question the admin? If so, why do people continue to support these same people? If I could provide links I could show you the list of Dem supporters that also believed there were WMD, a former president who made a speach declaring Iraq had WMD. This was also believed by numerous intelligence agencies across the globe, the UK being just 1, did Bush cook up some grand conspiracy and get these other countries on board with us and his war? Doubtful, it might just be that everyone actually thought he had WMD. Please provide the proof that the WH or the admin deliberatly manipulated the facts. If he lied as you say how come no court has proven this or even taken up the case? A Spanish judge just threw a war crimes case out. You have absolutely no proof the admin lied to go to war. That is a left ideology that has no legs to support it. If he knowingly lied about going to war, how come he isn't up on war crimes, or even members of his admin? Why isn't the new president going after the former admin? Since when has Arlen Spector been a conservative? Maybe a R but no conservative. He is really a poor example to use in this debate. The R party is dead rhetoric is hardly new, the D's were scrambling in \"00\" and \"04\". After Nixon everyone thought the R party was a thing of the past. I was one of those outraged at Bushes liberal spending policies, but does that make it OK for Obama to continue the trend? What will your excuse for Obama be if he spends us into a depression? You can only blame Bush for so long! All of these politicos were duped by Bush I guess? \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.\" - Sen.

        "quote": "Originally posted by Bill_Fold: Very, Very subjective, and missing facts to back up the claims. quote: Both Hoover and FDR tried to artificially pump up the economy by increasing credit, aiding banks, and increasing federal expenditures, including spending on futile \"make-work\" public works programs\u2014all of which required the economy to fall farther back toward equilibrium, thus turning a mundane recession into the Great Depression. We all know (or should know) that FDR was trying to prop up the economy and cheer people's spirits at the same time in what was (until now) the worst economic mess in our history... and that is fact. That the writer claims Hoover did ANYTHING to prop up the economy is a complete Fallacy. Hoover did NOTHING to prop up the economy, and THAT is why it continued to tank and reach for an ever lower economic bottom(which happened in 1932-33), UNTIL FDR took office, and even then it took 4 YEARS to get most people back to work, and another 5 for the Depression to finally end. This President may not be FDR, and he is certainly no Hoover. What he is is a dynamic, honest and intellectually superb President who has demonstrated that he knows what he is doing and isn't afraid to tackle any of our problems and look for solutions.

If he lied as you say how come no court has proven this or even taken up the case? A Spanish judge just threw a war crimes case out. You have absolutely no proof the admin lied to go to war. That is a left ideology that has no legs to support it. If he knowingly lied about going to war, how come he isn't up on war crimes, or even members of his admin? Why isn't the new president going after the former admin? Since when has Arlen Spector been a conservative? Maybe a R but no conservative. He is really a poor example to use in this debate.

He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real...\" - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), January 23. 2003 What about these quotes before Bush was even a thought? \"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.\" - President Bill Clinton, February 4, 1998 \"If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\" - President Bill Clinton, February 17, 1998 \"We must stop Saddam from ever again jeopardizing the stability and security of his neighbors with weapons of mass destruction.\" - Madeline Albright, February 1, 1998 \"He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.\" - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, February 18, 1998 \"[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.\" Letter to President Clinton. - (D) Senators Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, others, October 9, 1998 \"Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\" - Rep.

I wonder if people will still be singing the presidents praise when this country is so far in debt, because of his outta control spending, our great great grandchildren will be picking up the tab? Please spare me the \"Bush did it\" argument, I'm no Bush apologist or supporter so if you reply with this argument it falls on deaf ears! I am fully aware of what Bush did! And Yes he is making the same mistakes as Hoover and FDR! Carbon Tax anyone? Maybe another trillion to those who are mostly responsible for this mess will turn it around? Bill-Fold while your learning a few their history please include how we, as a country, recovered from the depression? I'll give ya a hint WWII. This recession is not worse than the Great Depression, at least not yet! Obama is just another politician. The Dems jumped aboard that excursion because they were carefully fed highly focused, bogus, biased, cooked, and otherwise highly suspect intelligence from sources the administration were warned to be pathologically dishonest by our allies intelligence agencies (and in a number of notable cases, our own CIA). No one has better access to intelligence than the White House, and they deliberately manipulated the facts to get congress to approve actions when they had already decided to go to war. Note that the political winds didn't change w/r/t Iraq until a number of events occurred: 1. The depth of outright incompetence that became the trademark of the Bush Administration became apparent. 2. The quantities of lies told by the administration to all that would listen to goad the nation into accepting war were realized. 3. Virtually none of the major reasons for going to war turned out to be true (note how many times the reasons changed). Were you one of the complainers when G W Bush couldn't find a spending bill too outrageous to veto for the first 6 years of his lamentable administration? I was!!! It took the democrats finally taking over the agenda (with too small of a majority to have any other power) to create a budget that he would veto. Now that 8 years of horrify incompetence have left our nation but a shell of what it used to be, now the republicans finally start complaining about the budget. Its too late for them. They have all but evaporated as a party and now resort to buffoonery when attempting to argue a point. As an example, look at the 18-page alternative budget they came up with: it is 99.999% content free for your protection, with nary a single digit referencing dollars throughout. At least they provide some comic relief... But even Arlen Spector has had enough: He is about to announce that he is resigning his republican affiliation to become a member of the democratic party. It is reported that the republican party has swung so far to the right that it is now the wrong party for him. Alright where to begin? So basically what your telling me is the the Dems are so incompetant they didn't question the admin? If so, why do people continue to support these same people? If I could provide links I could show you the list of Dem supporters that also believed there were WMD, a former president who made a speach declaring Iraq had WMD. This was also believed by numerous intelligence agencies across the globe, the UK being just 1, did Bush cook up some grand conspiracy and get these other countries on board with us and his war? Doubtful, it might just be that everyone actually thought he had WMD. Please provide the proof that the WH or the admin deliberatly manipulated the facts. If he lied as you say how come no court has proven this or even taken up the case? A Spanish judge just threw a war crimes case out. You have absolutely no proof the admin lied to go to war. That is a left ideology that has no legs to support it. If he knowingly lied about going to war, how come he isn't up on war crimes, or even members of his admin? Why isn't the new president going after the former admin? Since when has Arlen Spector been a conservative? Maybe a R but no conservative. He is really a poor example to use in this debate. The R party is dead rhetoric is hardly new, the D's were scrambling in \"00\" and \"04\". After Nixon everyone thought the R party was a thing of the past. I was one of those outraged at Bushes liberal spending policies, but does that make it OK for Obama to continue the trend? What will your excuse for Obama be if he spends us into a depression? You can only blame Bush for so long! All of these politicos were duped by Bush I guess? \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region.

Note that the political winds didn't change w/r/t Iraq until a number of events occurred: 1. The depth of outright incompetence that became the trademark of the Bush Administration became apparent. 2. The quantities of lies told by the administration to all that would listen to goad the nation into accepting war were realized. 3. Virtually none of the major reasons for going to war turned out to be true (note how many times the reasons changed). Were you one of the complainers when G W Bush couldn't find a spending bill too outrageous to veto for the first 6 years of his lamentable administration? I was!!! It took the democrats finally taking over the agenda (with too small of a majority to have any other power) to create a budget that he would veto. Now that 8 years of horrify incompetence have left our nation but a shell of what it used to be, now the republicans finally start complaining about the budget. Its too late for them. They have all but evaporated as a party and now resort to buffoonery when attempting to argue a point. As an example, look at the 18-page alternative budget they came up with: it is 99.999% content free for your protection, with nary a single digit referencing dollars throughout. At least they provide some comic relief... But even Arlen Spector has had enough: He is about to announce that he is resigning his republican affiliation to become a member of the democratic party. It is reported that the republican party has swung so far to the right that it is now the wrong party for him. Alright where to begin? So basically what your telling me is the the Dems are so incompetant they didn't question the admin? If so, why do people continue to support these same people? If I could provide links I could show you the list of Dem supporters that also believed there were WMD, a former president who made a speach declaring Iraq had WMD. This was also believed by numerous intelligence agencies across the globe, the UK being just 1, did Bush cook up some grand conspiracy and get these other countries on board with us and his war? Doubtful, it might just be that everyone actually thought he had WMD. Please provide the proof that the WH or the admin deliberatly manipulated the facts. If he lied as you say how come no court has proven this or even taken up the case? A Spanish judge just threw a war crimes case out. You have absolutely no proof the admin lied to go to war. That is a left ideology that has no legs to support it. If he knowingly lied about going to war, how come he isn't up on war crimes, or even members of his admin? Why isn't the new president going after the former admin? Since when has Arlen Spector been a conservative? Maybe a R but no conservative. He is really a poor example to use in this debate. The R party is dead rhetoric is hardly new, the D's were scrambling in \"00\" and \"04\". After Nixon everyone thought the R party was a thing of the past. I was one of those outraged at Bushes liberal spending policies, but does that make it OK for Obama to continue the trend? What will your excuse for Obama be if he spends us into a depression? You can only blame Bush for so long! All of these politicos were duped by Bush I guess? \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region.

Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), October 10, 2002 \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\" - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), October 10, 2002 \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" - Sen.

Joseph Biden (D-Del) September 4, 2002 \"Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, among other things, continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability, actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations.\" -Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) February 5, 2003 \"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real...\" - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), January 23. 2003 What about these quotes before Bush was even a thought? \"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.\" - President Bill Clinton, February 4, 1998 \"If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear.

Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), December 16, 1998 \"Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.\" - Madeline Albright, Clinton's Secretary of State, November 10, 1999 Excellent article. The left doesn't like to admit that they thought just like most Americans that Saddam had WMD and are ashamed to admit it. Everybody knows that Saddam didn't care about any UN laws or his people. He did what ever he wanted and that is just a fact of life.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by ryerye13B: quote: quote: Originally posted by ryerye13B: \"but decided somewhere along the line that it would be far more fun (if not oil-licious) to go for an uninvited visit into Iraq.\" Ah yes the lefts favorite tag-line, \"war for oil\", kinda like \"Bush let the Bin Ladens leave on Sept 11th, the only flight out.\" Let us not forget that all of our favorite Dems jumped on board for this excursion, funny how when the political winds changed those same Dems jumped ship. I wonder if people will still be singing the presidents praise when this country is so far in debt, because of his outta control spending, our great great grandchildren will be picking up the tab? Please spare me the \"Bush did it\" argument, I'm no Bush apologist or supporter so if you reply with this argument it falls on deaf ears! I am fully aware of what Bush did! And Yes he is making the same mistakes as Hoover and FDR! Carbon Tax anyone? Maybe another trillion to those who are mostly responsible for this mess will turn it around? Bill-Fold while your learning a few their history please include how we, as a country, recovered from the depression? I'll give ya a hint WWII. This recession is not worse than the Great Depression, at least not yet! Obama is just another politician. The Dems jumped aboard that excursion because they were carefully fed highly focused, bogus, biased, cooked, and otherwise highly suspect intelligence from sources the administration were warned to be pathologically dishonest by our allies intelligence agencies (and in a number of notable cases, our own CIA). No one has better access to intelligence than the White House, and they deliberately manipulated the facts to get congress to approve actions when they had already decided to go to war. Note that the political winds didn't change w/r/t Iraq until a number of events occurred: 1. The depth of outright incompetence that became the trademark of the Bush Administration became apparent. 2. The quantities of lies told by the administration to all that would listen to goad the nation into accepting war were realized. 3. Virtually none of the major reasons for going to war turned out to be true (note how many times the reasons changed). Were you one of the complainers when G W Bush couldn't find a spending bill too outrageous to veto for the first 6 years of his lamentable administration? I was!!! It took the democrats finally taking over the agenda (with too small of a majority to have any other power) to create a budget that he would veto. Now that 8 years of horrify incompetence have left our nation but a shell of what it used to be, now the republicans finally start complaining about the budget. Its too late for them. They have all but evaporated as a party and now resort to buffoonery when attempting to argue a point. As an example, look at the 18-page alternative budget they came up with: it is 99.999% content free for your protection, with nary a single digit referencing dollars throughout. At least they provide some comic relief... But even Arlen Spector has had enough: He is about to announce that he is resigning his republican affiliation to become a member of the democratic party. It is reported that the republican party has swung so far to the right that it is now the wrong party for him. Alright where to begin? So basically what your telling me is the the Dems are so incompetant they didn't question the admin? If so, why do people continue to support these same people? If I could provide links I could show you the list of Dem supporters that also believed there were WMD, a former president who made a speach declaring Iraq had WMD. This was also believed by numerous intelligence agencies across the globe, the UK being just 1, did Bush cook up some grand conspiracy and get these other countries on board with us and his war? Doubtful, it might just be that everyone actually thought he had WMD. Please provide the proof that the WH or the admin deliberatly manipulated the facts. If he lied as you say how come no court has proven this or even taken up the case? A Spanish judge just threw a war crimes case out. You have absolutely no proof the admin lied to go to war. That is a left ideology that has no legs to support it. If he knowingly lied about going to war, how come he isn't up on war crimes, or even members of his admin? Why isn't the new president going after the former admin? Since when has Arlen Spector been a conservative? Maybe a R but no conservative. He is really a poor example to use in this debate. The R party is dead rhetoric is hardly new, the D's were scrambling in \"00\" and \"04\". After Nixon everyone thought the R party was a thing of the past. I was one of those outraged at Bushes liberal spending policies, but does that make it OK for Obama to continue the trend? What will your excuse for Obama be if he spends us into a depression? You can only blame Bush for so long! All of these politicos were duped by Bush I guess? \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.\" - Sen.
