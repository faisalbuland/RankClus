You're still angry you lost and you'd vote NO if they were giving away FREE ice cream cones. For God's sake man - the GOP's anemic and/or non-existant plan didn't work under YOUR administration when YOU controlled the three branches of govt. You offered no intiatives, you just wanted to argue and continue your bi-partisanship. If you members of the GOP don't have a better plan, then sit down, shut up and LISTEN. And give the President a chance. It's more than what we got from your side for the 8 fruitless years before - with \"W\". Stop playing games. Try REPRESENTING your constitutuancy for a change - that would be a novel experience.",
