IMO, his failure to accept responsibility was one of the faults of President Bush (there were many, but I still think the good outweighed the bad). Now, for those on this board that just continue partisan attacks - you make yourself look ridiculous (you know, like jack flats always looks which is why it is difficult to take any post he makes as serious). There are many things you can complain about with the current POTUS, but this is not one of them. People from all parties should applaud this statement. Let's just hope it is not empty rhetoric. SCOUTS OUT!",
