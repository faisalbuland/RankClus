Eight and a half years later al Qaeda struck again on 9/11/01. It has been a little over seven and a half years since the 9/11 attack. In that time, the Bush Administration has used extraordinary measures to keep American from being attacked again. President Bush and his supporters claim that keeping America safe from another attack since 9/11 has been one of the Bush Administration\u2019s greatest achievements.

I don't blame any President for not preventing any given terrorist attack. I blame the terrorists. We can only go so far to protect ourselves. For God's sake we've been fighting crime in America since the country was founded and it still destroys thousands of American lives every year. Though it is subjective and often difficult to define, reasonable measures should always be taken to prevent terrorist attacks. More often than not it means that Federal and local law enforcement, combined with awareness, and national intelligence services need to work together to share information and investigate possible attacks. That alone would have probably prevented 9/11. We are a country of over 300 million people. One terrorist can kill hundreds or thousands depending on numerous and sundry factors.",

In the real world, Clinton's response to the threat posed by terrorists was to reduce the very means by which America had to reply. He dismantled the Cold War military by reducing it by half, cut the defense budget so that necessary training was all but impossible, and refused to fund the modernization of the force's communication upgrade at the rate requested by the Pentagon. He further reduced the CIA funding of HUMINT (Human Intelligence) infrastructure, leaving us at the mercy of purely SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) sources to anticipate the actions of such threats. Clinton then responded to overt threats such as the Cole bombing and the attack on the East African embassies by inept and impotent 'missile strikes' in the Sudan and Afghanistan that accomplished absolutely nothing but increase the resolve of terrorist organizations that they could strike American targets and suffer no adverse results.

It's easy and fast to cut a branch off, but growing it back takes a good deal longer, sometimes years. So Clinton cutting the military and CIA HUMINT infrastructure was an easy, quick stroke of the pen. Simply sign the order and the funding stops. Soldiers and (more importantly) mid-grade officers and NCOs leave the service, not to return. Intelligence sorces, funded by CIA dollars and contacted by agents are simply not paid the next year, and no CIA operative is available to gather the intelligence, even if the money WAS available. And the country sleeps, unaware of the true impact of this 'pruning'. A crisis arises. Inexact intelligence sources show an increase in activity, but without the HUMINT sources we used to pay and support, we're stuck with only the shadow play of SIGINT, without on-the-ground verification means. These cannot be recontructed on the fly - making contacts and recruiting informants takes time, effort and above all - patience. Nine months isn't nearly enough time to create such a verification process. Here's the most damning part: Neither is nine months or even nine YEARS enough to rebuild a US Army division. None of those mid-grade officers and NCOs who left ever make senior rank. The slots they held in the 90s were not available for junior officers and NCOs to occupy when their time came. Those that did make mid-grade aren't enough to flesh out new units during a crisis - they're needed in the fighting line. Growth of the military cannot take place during wartime due to the immediate needs of the forces. The basic equipment issue would take a full year or two alone, but the biggest problem is personnel. You see, it takes a decade to create those mid-grade officers and NCOs that Clinton pruned in the 90s. You can grouse about needing a draft all you want, but someone has to train and lead those soldiers, and unless you want E-5s as company 1SGs or 1LT Battalion commanders, you're going to be hard pressed to adequately man the staff structure of these 'new units'.

The terrorist\u2019s plan was for the 1,500 lb bomb to knock the North Tower into the South Tower, bringing both towers down and killing thousands of people. Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was convicted as the mastermind of that attack and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Yousef's uncle is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Eight and a half years later al Qaeda struck again on 9/11/01. It has been a little over seven and a half years since the 9/11 attack. In that time, the Bush Administration has used extraordinary measures to keep American from being attacked again.

The terrorist\u2019s plan was for the 1,500 lb bomb to knock the North Tower into the South Tower, bringing both towers down and killing thousands of people. Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was convicted as the mastermind of that attack and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Yousef's uncle is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Eight and a half years later al Qaeda struck again on 9/11/01. It has been a little over seven and a half years since the 9/11 attack. In that time, the Bush Administration has used extraordinary measures to keep American from being attacked again.

I don't blame any President for not preventing any given terrorist attack. I blame the terrorists. We can only go so far to protect ourselves. For God's sake we've been fighting crime in America since the country was founded and it still destroys thousands of American lives every year. Though it is subjective and often difficult to define, reasonable measures should always be taken to prevent terrorist attacks. More often than not it means that Federal and local law enforcement, combined with awareness, and national intelligence services need to work together to share information and investigate possible attacks.

In the real world, Clinton's response to the threat posed by terrorists was to reduce the very means by which America had to reply. He dismantled the Cold War military by reducing it by half, cut the defense budget so that necessary training was all but impossible, and refused to fund the modernization of the force's communication upgrade at the rate requested by the Pentagon. He further reduced the CIA funding of HUMINT (Human Intelligence) infrastructure, leaving us at the mercy of purely SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) sources to anticipate the actions of such threats. Clinton then responded to overt threats such as the Cole bombing and the attack on the East African embassies by inept and impotent 'missile strikes' in the Sudan and Afghanistan that accomplished absolutely nothing but increase the resolve of terrorist organizations that they could strike American targets and suffer no adverse results. The truth is, Clinton was asleep at the helm of the ship of state. If anything, his actions and response to threats INVITED the 9-11 attacks as they were planned, developed and the terrorists trained during his second term - in near complete safety.

Sullivan013 Wow, that was an outstanding summary of events. Thanks for a reality post! Truly, can I save it and quote you sometime down the road when need be? A whole era of dereliction of duty was concisely stated in your one post. Thank you. Yet as lame as President Clinton was, there was not another attack on American soil during his term, even though he created \"the environment where we were vulnerable to such an attack.\" President Bush did harden the American target, there is no doubt about that. But did he really prevent another attack, or does it take a long time for al Qaeda to mount an attack? Well, I for one am confused. I hear people all the time say that Bush gets all the credit for keeping the country safe. And yet, the 9/11 attacks occured nine monthts into the Bush administration's time in office. So the attacks occured on Bush's watch. Now, people can make the argument that it was Clinton's fault that the country had her guard down, which allowed for the 9/11 attacks. My question is, is Bush himself not guilty for 9/11, since he was already in office nine months prior to the attacks?

It's easy and fast to cut a branch off, but growing it back takes a good deal longer, sometimes years. So Clinton cutting the military and CIA HUMINT infrastructure was an easy, quick stroke of the pen. Simply sign the order and the funding stops. Soldiers and (more importantly) mid-grade officers and NCOs leave the service, not to return. Intelligence sorces, funded by CIA dollars and contacted by agents are simply not paid the next year, and no CIA operative is available to gather the intelligence, even if the money WAS available. And the country sleeps, unaware of the true impact of this 'pruning'. A crisis arises. Inexact intelligence sources show an increase in activity, but without the HUMINT sources we used to pay and support, we're stuck with only the shadow play of SIGINT, without on-the-ground verification means. These cannot be recontructed on the fly - making contacts and recruiting informants takes time, effort and above all - patience. Nine months isn't nearly enough time to create such a verification process. Here's the most damning part: Neither is nine months or even nine YEARS enough to rebuild a US Army division. None of those mid-grade officers and NCOs who left ever make senior rank. The slots they held in the 90s were not available for junior officers and NCOs to occupy when their time came. Those that did make mid-grade aren't enough to flesh out new units during a crisis - they're needed in the fighting line. Growth of the military cannot take place during wartime due to the immediate needs of the forces. The basic equipment issue would take a full year or two alone, but the biggest problem is personnel. You see, it takes a decade to create those mid-grade officers and NCOs that Clinton pruned in the 90s. You can grouse about needing a draft all you want, but someone has to train and lead those soldiers, and unless you want E-5s as company 1SGs or 1LT Battalion commanders, you're going to be hard pressed to adequately man the staff structure of these 'new units'. It just can't be done in the modern world without severe costs as these new Battalion and Brigade staffs learn the hard lessons in months when they should have years to perfect them. We've seen it before: Bull Run, Kassarine Pass, Task Force Smith. This was the cost of the 'peace dividend' that Clinton cashed during his time as President. The sad thing is, some of us who left anticipated in 1993-95 what might happen if we went to war again after Clinton's cuts, but the public was too enthralled with the booming economy and 'aw shucks' attitude of the POTUS to worry,...or care. quote: \"God and the soldier we adore, in times of trouble, not before, With the crisis past, and all things righted God is forgotten, the soldier slighted.\" Winston Churchill Sullivan013",
