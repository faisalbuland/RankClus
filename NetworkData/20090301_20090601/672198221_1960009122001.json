Again. This, after a triple blast from US commanders accusing Pakistani intelligence of being behind virtually everything west of India and shy of Persia. Pakistan has been trying to subdue the northwest 'clans', one way or another, since the days it supported Anti-Soviet operations for the US. The Taliban were one of the early off-shoots of the kill Russians program. They've never gone away and have turned to bite the hands that fed them numerous times. There is always a chance that this time will be a kismet and see the northwest frontier become more pacific. The greater odds are that it will fail, again, and weaken one of the only friendly administrations America has left in the sub-continent. This message has been edited.
