I\u2019ve just confirmed with a spokeman for Governor Ed Rendell that he will do everything he can to help the Democratic candidate defeat Specter if the latter remains a Republican or if he pulls a Joe Lieberman from the right, switching to Independent while promising to caucus with Republicans. That\u2019s key, for two reasons. First, because Rendell is a longtime close friend of Specter, and many thought he tacitly aided Specter in 2004. And second, because it ups the pressure on Specter to switch to the Dems. Here\u2019s why: If Specter fears losing a Republican primary \u2014 as many expect him to do \u2014 and pulls out to run as an Indy in a general election, his chances of holding his seat are slim indeed. He\u2019d be squeezed between his GOP challenger and a Democratic challenger who has full backing from Rendell. In other words, Rendell\u2019s vow of opposition means his only hope of survival may be switching to the Dems. Rendell spokesperson Chuck Ardo tells me that Rendell will throw his full weight behind the Democrat if Specter stays Republican or becomes a GOP-caucusing Indy. \u201cHe will do everything he can to support the Democratic candidate,\u201d Ardo says, \u201cno matter what the circumstances.\u201d What\u2019s more, Rendell has to make good on this vow because with Senate Dems approaching 60, the stakes are excruciatingly high. Asked if Specter would have Rendell\u2019s backing if he became a Dem, Ardo said: \u201cIf he became the Democratic candidate he would have the governor\u2019s support.\u201d \"http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/employee-free-choice-act/rendell-will-throw-his-full-weight-behind-democrat-against-specter/\" Just a greedy politician. I say feck him and good-bye.

        "reply": " Welcome to the party Senator Specter, glad to have you on board. My way of looking at this, just a job preservation move. However, I for one hope that the progressive wing of the Pennsylvania party put up someone as well. It will keep him (Specter) honest. He is my Senator and I'm drafting a long congratulatory e-mail to him now.",

I\u2019ve just confirmed with a spokeman for Governor Ed Rendell that he will do everything he can to help the Democratic candidate defeat Specter if the latter remains a Republican or if he pulls a Joe Lieberman from the right, switching to Independent while promising to caucus with Republicans. That\u2019s key, for two reasons. First, because Rendell is a longtime close friend of Specter, and many thought he tacitly aided Specter in 2004. And second, because it ups the pressure on Specter to switch to the Dems. Here\u2019s why: If Specter fears losing a Republican primary \u2014 as many expect him to do \u2014 and pulls out to run as an Indy in a general election, his chances of holding his seat are slim indeed. He\u2019d be squeezed between his GOP challenger and a Democratic challenger who has full backing from Rendell. In other words, Rendell\u2019s vow of opposition means his only hope of survival may be switching to the Dems. Rendell spokesperson Chuck Ardo tells me that Rendell will throw his full weight behind the Democrat if Specter stays Republican or becomes a GOP-caucusing Indy. \u201cHe will do everything he can to support the Democratic candidate,\u201d Ardo says, \u201cno matter what the circumstances.\u201d What\u2019s more, Rendell has to make good on this vow because with Senate Dems approaching 60, the stakes are excruciatingly high. Asked if Specter would have Rendell\u2019s backing if he became a Dem, Ardo said: \u201cIf he became the Democratic candidate he would have the governor\u2019s support.\u201d \"http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/employee-free-choice-act/rendell-will-throw-his-full-weight-behind-democrat-against-specter/\" Just a greedy politician.

I\u2019ve just confirmed with a spokeman for Governor Ed Rendell that he will do everything he can to help the Democratic candidate defeat Specter if the latter remains a Republican or if he pulls a Joe Lieberman from the right, switching to Independent while promising to caucus with Republicans. That\u2019s key, for two reasons. First, because Rendell is a longtime close friend of Specter, and many thought he tacitly aided Specter in 2004. And second, because it ups the pressure on Specter to switch to the Dems. Here\u2019s why: If Specter fears losing a Republican primary \u2014 as many expect him to do \u2014 and pulls out to run as an Indy in a general election, his chances of holding his seat are slim indeed. He\u2019d be squeezed between his GOP challenger and a Democratic challenger who has full backing from Rendell. In other words, Rendell\u2019s vow of opposition means his only hope of survival may be switching to the Dems. Rendell spokesperson Chuck Ardo tells me that Rendell will throw his full weight behind the Democrat if Specter stays Republican or becomes a GOP-caucusing Indy. \u201cHe will do everything he can to support the Democratic candidate,\u201d Ardo says, \u201cno matter what the circumstances.\u201d What\u2019s more, Rendell has to make good on this vow because with Senate Dems approaching 60, the stakes are excruciatingly high. Asked if Specter would have Rendell\u2019s backing if he became a Dem, Ardo said: \u201cIf he became the Democratic candidate he would have the governor\u2019s support.\u201d \"http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/employee-free-choice-act/rendell-will-throw-his-full-weight-behind-democrat-against-specter/\" Just a greedy politician.
