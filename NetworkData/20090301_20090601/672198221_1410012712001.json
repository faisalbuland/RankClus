It's the truth that's worse than any cruel fantasy. Putting all politics and stuff aside, I will just say, those unfortunate solders suffered greatly. But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros.",

There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries.

The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

And grabbing other Baltic nations up? Pathetic for an excuse. Face it, the Nazi's(And Weimar before that) & the Soviet Union Collaborated from the 1920's onwards. The Soviets allowed Training of Pilots, Tank Crews, Testing of Tanks at Ryazan and other bases. Dont walk in here suddenly claiming you had to be friends with the Germans. There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries. Bolshevism/communism is a common responsibility of all nations involved, not just Russia. quote: Originally posted by TataH:Putting all politics and stuff aside, I will just say, those unfortunate solders suffered greatly. But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros. The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away", 
        "reply": " The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home.

The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away",

        "content": "Russia is to outlaw criticism of Soviet military tactics during the Second World War. The plan was announced after a television documentary exposed the scale of human losses during one of the conflict's bloodiest battles. The program stirred deep emotions in a country that traditionally glorified the exploits of ordinary soldiers during the \"Great Patriotic War,\" but often ignored the immense human cost of the victory over Nazi Germany. As anger grew over the documentary, the government was thought to have taken advantage of the public mood at a time when recession threatened the popularity of Vladimir Putin, the Prime Minister. Sergei Shoigu, the Emergency Situations Minister, called for a law that would make it a criminal offence to suggest the Soviet Union did not win the war. Mr Shoigu indicated the legislation would also seek to punish other states that denied they were liberated by the Red Army. Their leaders could be banned from Russian soil.

The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away", 
        "reply": " The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

Indeed ask Alger Hiss and the Rosenburgs, Ask Kim Philby.......... quote: Originally posted by TataH:Percentage wise, there were foreign nationals and minorities in communist party than ethnic Russians. Like I always say, it was chickens coming to roost home. There were lots of Polish communists in Russia, as well as Germans. And bolshevics were heavily funded in Russia from overseas. Communism was not just Russian monstor, I will assure you. Funny how they all would take the Line of Stalin and the Central Committee, eh? No Variation in thought, almost as if controlled , Hmmmmmmmm..........",

The Soviets allowed Training of Pilots, Tank Crews, Testing of Tanks at Ryazan and other bases. Dont walk in here suddenly claiming you had to be friends with the Germans. There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries. Bolshevism/communism is a common responsibility of all nations involved, not just Russia. quote: Originally posted by TataH:Putting all politics and stuff aside, I will just say, those unfortunate solders suffered greatly. But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros. The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son.

The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides.

I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

We've caught hell from the several countries that weren't allies then and not exactly friendly now. Hiroshima is always used a wild card in debates. greywolf makes an interesting comment. I like to add that many of the former Soviet states may return to the fold not from military threats as much as being left out in the cold from American, that promises one thing, then leaves them to struggle on their own. And, EU that treats them like a red headed step child. Back to Russia. WWII being the most terrible wars, devastated their country and was brought to them. At least that what I've always thought.

While the Marshall plan brough Food and Money to Europe, the Soviets stripped the same out of their Occupational zones & Territories If you'd look at stats, you'd see that Russia was dumping more in those states than taking from them. There were only two donar republics in SU, Russia and Belarus. All the other were receipents. Meaning they were taking more than produced. Standard of living was also higher there than it was in Russia. It was some occupation, I'll say. quote: Originally posted by TataH: As far as Russia attacking Poland and making a pact with Germany. That would have not happened, if Great Britain and France took Stalin's offer. He was trying to make a pact with them first So thats the excuse for stabbing the Poles in the back. And grabbing other Baltic nations up? Pathetic for an excuse. Face it, the Nazi's(And Weimar before that) & the Soviet Union Collaborated from the 1920's onwards. The Soviets allowed Training of Pilots, Tank Crews, Testing of Tanks at Ryazan and other bases. Dont walk in here suddenly claiming you had to be friends with the Germans. There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries. Bolshevism/communism is a common responsibility of all nations involved, not just Russia. quote: Originally posted by TataH:Putting all politics and stuff aside, I will just say, those unfortunate solders suffered greatly. But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros. The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home.

The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries. Bolshevism/communism is a common responsibility of all nations involved, not just Russia. quote: Originally posted by TataH:Putting all politics and stuff aside, I will just say, those unfortunate solders suffered greatly. But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros. The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

I guarantee you American, British, French, Brazilian, Polish, Czechoslovakian, Norweigan, Dutch, Greek, Yugoslav, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, Belgian, Blood also ran red into defeating the Germans..... Don't doubt it. But. 80% of dead germans? Happened in the Eastern front quote: Originally posted by TataH:If Russia was not putting up such a big fight on the Eastern front, American casualties while defeating Germany would have been much, much higher. And if the Soviets hadnt coordinated with the French Communists to hamper French Efforts against Germany in 1939-1940, Barbarossa might'nt have ever happened. French Communist groups staged Strikes,Work Slowdwns on Vitally needed Material, got French Soldiers to desert, Lowered Morale of the Soldiery and Citizenry all on Moscows behalf, as ordered. And if French have not had their revolution, and if Germans would not sponsor bolshevics in Russia, and if ideas of Socialism and Liberalism were not spreading out all over Europe as a mad fire, and, and and if.... quote: Originally posted by TataH:Also, i beleive Russia has paid off it's WW2 debt, even though Russia was devastated after the war, and it's population was straving. As was many parts of Europe. It didnt stop the Soviets from stripping the Balkan Occupied Territories of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Germany of anything they thought usefull, did it? While the Marshall plan brough Food and Money to Europe, the Soviets stripped the same out of their Occupational zones & Territories If you'd look at stats, you'd see that Russia was dumping more in those states than taking from them.

There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries.

But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros. The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries. Bolshevism/communism is a common responsibility of all nations involved, not just Russia. quote: Originally posted by TataH:Putting all politics and stuff aside, I will just say, those unfortunate solders suffered greatly. But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros. The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

I guarantee you American, British, French, Brazilian, Polish, Czechoslovakian, Norweigan, Dutch, Greek, Yugoslav, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, Belgian, Blood also ran red into defeating the Germans..... Don't doubt it. But. 80% of dead germans? Happened in the Eastern front quote: Originally posted by TataH:If Russia was not putting up such a big fight on the Eastern front, American casualties while defeating Germany would have been much, much higher. And if the Soviets hadnt coordinated with the French Communists to hamper French Efforts against Germany in 1939-1940, Barbarossa might'nt have ever happened. French Communist groups staged Strikes,Work Slowdwns on Vitally needed Material, got French Soldiers to desert, Lowered Morale of the Soldiery and Citizenry all on Moscows behalf, as ordered. And if French have not had their revolution, and if Germans would not sponsor bolshevics in Russia, and if ideas of Socialism and Liberalism were not spreading out all over Europe as a mad fire, and, and and if.... quote: Originally posted by TataH:Also, i beleive Russia has paid off it's WW2 debt, even though Russia was devastated after the war, and it's population was straving. As was many parts of Europe. It didnt stop the Soviets from stripping the Balkan Occupied Territories of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Germany of anything they thought usefull, did it? While the Marshall plan brough Food and Money to Europe, the Soviets stripped the same out of their Occupational zones & Territories If you'd look at stats, you'd see that Russia was dumping more in those states than taking from them.

There is a Clear Trail of Documents of your cooperation in Military matters dating to 1923. Nothing happens suddenly and everything has it's roots and explanation. Bolshevism in Russia was sponsored from overseas in an effort to weaken Russia. It was also heavily fueled by minorities, Polish and Baltic nationals as well. It was chicken coming to roost home. Bolshevic cells were active in all those countries.

But they were fighting for their country that was under attack, and they deserve to be remembered as true heros. The WWII Soviet Soldiers suffered Greatly against a Viscious Enemy, and against a STAVKA & Party, head of State which cared little if Millions of them died in the process. Those that were taken Prisoner, were re-imprisoned upon release from German camps, or Executed. Millions fewer would have died if your Stalin hadnt purged the best of the Officer Corps and used commonsense tactics instead of Human Wave attacks. The Blame for many of those deaths lies within the Kremlin for throwing those Men away The last bit I agree with. Even though it was not quite as severe as some are trying to show it. ETA: I went to university in Russia in the 90s. You would not beleive the amount of negative information that was poured on us about us, Soviets, and Russian in particular. I mean how terrible we were. And I heard that particular saying as well. What I thought was odd, is that my own experiences didn't support that. My grandmother was from that area of Poland that was conquered. She was in labor camp in Germany. My great grandfather was an open anti Soviet, very vocal about it too. My grandmother also stole something from the place she worked at, when she got desperate, because she had nothing to feed to her young son. I think she grabbed a bunch of spoons and things from local canteen. She told me that she just lost it. She was talked to and helped with money that particular time. According to what I studied she should have been sent to Siberia. I also spent summers in the area, there were a lot of people the same as my grandmother. The only ones I knew that spent time in prison were those that collaborated with Germans, I mean served as police. And given that all those people lived together through occupation and afterwards, they knew everything about each other. The numbers we were given that were killed by Stalin were somewhat in pair of what was killed by Germans. Given that just about every family in Russia has relatives lost to WW2, I am yet to meet anyone whose relatives were killed by Stalin's repressions. I also looked at the numbers of SU prison's population during repression era, and numbers just don't add up. I still don't think we know the entire truth about Soviet era and WW2. A lot of material is still classified, and many more studies are still to be made. And it's harder to see the truth, because of abundance of propaganda on BOTH sides. Anyway, I think Stalin was a monstor, but I don't think he killed as many people as he is given the credit for. This message has been edited. Last edited by: TataH, Sat 07 March 2009 08:07 PM",

How they treated their enemies was equally brutal. That's war.
