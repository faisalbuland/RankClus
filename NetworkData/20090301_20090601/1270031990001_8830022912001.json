As you and I know, our modern calendars are all artificial systems to mark time here on earth, based on the regular rotations and orbits of our sun and moon, as well as our planet's tilt that causes the seasons. This particular assertion about the 28-year solar cycle is based in old astrology that was used to form ancient (and not terribly accurate) calendars. Take a look: \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkat_HaHammah It's ancient astrology, based NOT on the sun's actual position in the universe, but on its apparent position relative to the stars and astrological constellations and planets. The calendar they used was quite inaccurate, and the result is that the calendar is not off by about 17 days: quote: As explained in the Talmud, there is a tradition that the Sun was created in its vernal equinox position at the beginning of the springtime Jewish lunar month of Nissan.[18] The sages of the Talmud settled disputes over the halachic definition of the vernal equinox by establishing it on March 25 of the Julian calendar. Because both the Julian calendar and Jewish tradition define a solar year as exactly 365.25 days, the halachic vernal equinox historically fell out on March 25th every year. This halachic equinox now falls about 17 days after the true equinox, with the error increasing by about 3/4 of a day per century. The sun is certainly not in the same position it was in 28 years ago. Our entire solar system is whipping around the center of our galaxy at a mind-boggling 500,000 miles an hour. Even then, it takes our solar system about 200,000,000 years to make a full rotation around our galaxy. And then, our galaxy itself is moving through space. So, yeah, the idea that our average little yellow star in the center of our little solar system makes a 28-year cycle and returns to its exact same spot where it was when it was \"created\"... sorry, not buying that. Honoring ancient traditions - that's fine. That's really cool, actually. But pretending that the perceptions of our solar system from ancient desert tribes can replace modern observations... yeah, not happening.",

This happens every 28 years www+betemunah.org/hachama.html][/URL] D.J. Shalom Donnie, Here is some info: Our primary source for the Blessing of the Sun, (Birkat HaChammah) is from the Babylonian Talmud, mesechet Brachot 59b. \u201cThe Sages taught, one who sees the sun in its cycle, the moon in its strength, the stars in their path, and the constellations in their orders says Blessed [is Hashem] Who makes creation.\u201d The braita goes on to state that the cycle of the sun is every 28 years. This a mathematical calculation according to the opinion of Shmuel, based on the length of the year such that the sun returns to the original point of its creation, which is the fourth day of the seven day week, every 28 years.[1] The Jewish Sages (Chazal) thought it important for us to make blessings on natural phenomena. What did Chazal want us to recognize or proclaim with such brachot? The opportunity to recite Birkat Hachammah occurs only once every 28 years. That this bracha occurs so infrequently compels us to probe deeply into what this particular bracha is meant to teach us. We will explore answers to this question by examining two facets of Birkat Hachammah: the symbolism of the sun in Jewish tradition, and the time of year that this bracha is said. Through consideration of these two points we will shed light on our place in the grand Creation. Symbolism of the Sun How does Jewish tradition relate to the sun? The ancient world deified the sun and worshipped it as a god. Though worship of the sun is rare today, if we stop to think about it, our entire lives still seem to revolve around the sun that unrelentingly rises and sets each day. The sun illuminates our world, drives our seasons, grows our food and sustains life on this planet. The sun\u2019s omnipresence and relentless rule serves as a motif in King Solomon\u2019s Ecclesiastes (Kohelet), where he wrote such verses as: \u201cThere is nothing new under the sun\u201d and \u201cWhat profit does man have for all his labor which he toils beneath the sun?\u201d On the surface these words connote a sense of despair and purposelessness. This was one reason for the ancient debate over whether to include Kohelet in the Tanakh. Rabbi Yanai provided us with the proper perspective to understand Kohelet, teaching[2] that if a person involves himself in matters that are \u201cunder the sun,\u201d indeed there is nothing new and all will be in vain, but if a human being involves himself with matters that are \u201cabove and preceded the sun\u201d then the work will not be in vain. What is \u201cabove and proceeded the sun\u201d? Torah: \u201cGod looked into the Torah and created the world.\u201d[3] Hence when one is engaged in Torah, in any or all of its many facets -- when one has a relationship with Torah -- one is dealing with matters of holiness and one\u2019s work will not be in vain. This is crucial to our understanding of Birkat HaChammah. When we make a blessing (a holy act \u201cabove the sun\u201d) on the sun, we acknowledge that as powerful as the sun is, there is a Creator Who is above the sun, and that our actions too are above the sun. Birkat Hachammah then serves as an expression of our faith in Hashem and a testament against the world view that proclaims that there is only that which is under the sun and an expression of our faith in Hashem. The Time of Our Freedom We are first introduced to the sun in the Book of Berei**** (Genesis), chapter 1 verse 14: \u201cGod said, \u2018Let there be luminaries [the sun, moon, and stars] in the firmament of the heaven to separate between the day and the night; and they shall serve as signs, and for festivals [Moadim], and for days and years.\u2019\u201d This creation of the sun takes place very near the time of the creation of humankind, which, as we know, is celebrated from Tishrei (Rosh Hashanah). Given this, we would expect that the commemoration of the creation of the sun would take place toward the end of Elul. However, we say the blessing in Nissan instead. Why? To understand this, we must recognize the unique nature of Jewish time. We know that the changing seasons of the natural world express the seasons of the spiritual world, the energies of that particular time.[4] Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter tie to the the corresponding festivals and holy days, expressing the spiritual spectrum of man and creation. Because of this, we are commanded to observe Passover[5] in the spring (Aviv),[6] and as a result, the Jewish calendar is a combination of both solar and lunar elements. This ensures that our holidays fall in the appropriate (spiritual) seasons. The Jewish calendar also has four different new years\u2019.[7] The New Moon (Rosh *****sh) of Tishrei is the Rosh Hashanah of the years, i.e., of \u201ctime\u201d and Rosh *****sh Nissan is the New Year of the Moadim (holidays). It would seem that the 28 year cycle of the sun should be reckoned from the month of Tishrei, since this is the beginning of the new year as it relates to time. However, Birkat Hachammah is reckoned from Nissan. This hints at a deeper relationship between Birkat Hachammah and the season of Passover, the Moed (holiday) of Freedom, which occurs in Nissan. The word \u201cmoed\u201d is usually translated as \u201choliday,\u201d but a moed is much more than a recounting of an historical event. It is an encounter between God and the Jewish people which occurs year by year, one aspect of our enduring relationship with our Creator.[8] The month of Nissan, the \u201chead of all months\u201d[9], is the month in which the foundations of the Jewish Nation are renewed, reaffirmed, and strengthened. The Moed of Freedom celebrates not just the absence of physical slavery, but freedom as an internal state of being. The spiritual energy of freedom is brought back into the world every Nissan. It is within our reach to experience freedom during this time: not just as a commemoration of the Jewish people\u2019s freedom from slavery, but as liberation from all that keeps us from being our best selves as individuals and as a nation![10] Thus, Chazal instructed us to say Birkat Hachammah in the spring, the month of Nissan, around the time of Passover,[11] because our experience of the spring and Passover, can doubly inspire us to rise above the sun, to orient our lives in such a way that they express the deepest ideals of our humanity. Avraham and the Sun The lesson of freedom to serve Hashem, which is so fundamental to Jewish life, really began with the strivings of one man\u2026Avraham. Consider also the following story in two variant forms: When this giant [Avraham] was weaned, he began to roam around in his mind, while he was still small, and began to think by day and by night, and he would wonder, \u201cHow is it possible that this sphere moves constantly without there being a mover, or one to turn it, for it is impossible that it turns itself?\u201d And he had no teacher or source of knowledge but he was sunk among senseless idol worshippers in Ur of the Chaldeans; his parents and the whole people worshipped idols and he worshipped with them. But his mind roamed in search of understanding till he achieved the true way and understood out of his own natural intelligence. He knew there is one God who moves the spheres, who created everything, there is none beside Him. He knew that the whole world was in error and that the cause of their error was that they worshipped idols and images, so that they had lost the truth. Abraham was forty years old when he recognized his Creator\u2026 (Rambam Hilchot Avodah Zara 1:3) And the other version of this story is sourced in a book called the Beith HaMidrash, which is a collection of Midrashim that have no known source. The collection was put together in the late 18th or 19th century: When Avraham was three years old he left the cave[12], he reflected in his heart: who created the heavens, the earth, and myself? He prayed the entire day to the sun. In the evening the sun set in the west and the moon rose in the east. When he saw the moon and the stars surrounding the moon, he said, this is what created the heavens, the earth, and myself, and these stars are it\u2019s ministers and servants, he stood all night long praying to the moon. In the morning the moon had set in the west and the sun rose in the east. He said \u201cthere is no strength in the hands of either of them\u201d, there is a master over them and over me, to him I will pray and prostrate myself. If we, like Avraham, would contemplate creation, we would realize that there is a Creator and that there is only one creation that is truly free, the soul of a human being. Creation is bound by the chains of natural law, the sun rises, the sun sets, day after day after day. Humankind possesses the single most profound power to recognize the Creator and to choose to live \u201cabove the sun.\u201d Creation without man is mute, under the sun, under the force of natural law.[13] But human beings can choose what to say and do, and if you think about what I just said carefully, you will realize that you are the voice of creation. So when we arise Erev Pesach this year to say Birkat HaChammah, may we be blessed with a full illumination that each and every moment of our lives is a blessing and that there is at least one thing new under the sun, that is you when you make this blessing and add your free willed voice to the symphony of creation!

[12] It is was written that Nimrod sought to kill Avraham, but Avraham was hidden in a cave underground.

I also know that the old 'standard' Chinese spellings sound absolutely nothing like the new 'standard' spellings (Peking vs Beijing).

This happens every 28 years www+betemunah.org/hachama.html][/URL] D.J. Shalom Donnie, Here is some info: Our primary source for the Blessing of the Sun, (Birkat HaChammah) is from the Babylonian Talmud, mesechet Brachot 59b. \u201cThe Sages taught, one who sees the sun in its cycle, the moon in its strength, the stars in their path, and the constellations in their orders says Blessed [is Hashem] Who makes creation.\u201d The braita goes on to state that the cycle of the sun is every 28 years. This a mathematical calculation according to the opinion of Shmuel, based on the length of the year such that the sun returns to the original point of its creation, which is the fourth day of the seven day week, every 28 years.[1] The Jewish Sages (Chazal) thought it important for us to make blessings on natural phenomena. What did Chazal want us to recognize or proclaim with such brachot? The opportunity to recite Birkat Hachammah occurs only once every 28 years. That this bracha occurs so infrequently compels us to probe deeply into what this particular bracha is meant to teach us. We will explore answers to this question by examining two facets of Birkat Hachammah: the symbolism of the sun in Jewish tradition, and the time of year that this bracha is said. Through consideration of these two points we will shed light on our place in the grand Creation. Symbolism of the Sun How does Jewish tradition relate to the sun? The ancient world deified the sun and worshipped it as a god. Though worship of the sun is rare today, if we stop to think about it, our entire lives still seem to revolve around the sun that unrelentingly rises and sets each day. The sun illuminates our world, drives our seasons, grows our food and sustains life on this planet. The sun\u2019s omnipresence and relentless rule serves as a motif in King Solomon\u2019s Ecclesiastes (Kohelet), where he wrote such verses as: \u201cThere is nothing new under the sun\u201d and \u201cWhat profit does man have for all his labor which he toils beneath the sun?\u201d On the surface these words connote a sense of despair and purposelessness. This was one reason for the ancient debate over whether to include Kohelet in the Tanakh. Rabbi Yanai provided us with the proper perspective to understand Kohelet, teaching[2] that if a person involves himself in matters that are \u201cunder the sun,\u201d indeed there is nothing new and all will be in vain, but if a human being involves himself with matters that are \u201cabove and preceded the sun\u201d then the work will not be in vain. What is \u201cabove and proceeded the sun\u201d? Torah: \u201cGod looked into the Torah and created the world.\u201d[3] Hence when one is engaged in Torah, in any or all of its many facets -- when one has a relationship with Torah -- one is dealing with matters of holiness and one\u2019s work will not be in vain. This is crucial to our understanding of Birkat HaChammah. When we make a blessing (a holy act \u201cabove the sun\u201d) on the sun, we acknowledge that as powerful as the sun is, there is a Creator Who is above the sun, and that our actions too are above the sun. Birkat Hachammah then serves as an expression of our faith in Hashem and a testament against the world view that proclaims that there is only that which is under the sun and an expression of our faith in Hashem. The Time of Our Freedom We are first introduced to the sun in the Book of Berei**** (Genesis), chapter 1 verse 14: \u201cGod said, \u2018Let there be luminaries [the sun, moon, and stars] in the firmament of the heaven to separate between the day and the night; and they shall serve as signs, and for festivals [Moadim], and for days and years.\u2019\u201d This creation of the sun takes place very near the time of the creation of humankind, which, as we know, is celebrated from Tishrei (Rosh Hashanah). Given this, we would expect that the commemoration of the creation of the sun would take place toward the end of Elul. However, we say the blessing in Nissan instead. Why? To understand this, we must recognize the unique nature of Jewish time. We know that the changing seasons of the natural world express the seasons of the spiritual world, the energies of that particular time.[4] Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter tie to the the corresponding festivals and holy days, expressing the spiritual spectrum of man and creation. Because of this, we are commanded to observe Passover[5] in the spring (Aviv),[6] and as a result, the Jewish calendar is a combination of both solar and lunar elements. This ensures that our holidays fall in the appropriate (spiritual) seasons. The Jewish calendar also has four different new years\u2019.[7] The New Moon (Rosh *****sh) of Tishrei is the Rosh Hashanah of the years, i.e., of \u201ctime\u201d and Rosh *****sh Nissan is the New Year of the Moadim (holidays). It would seem that the 28 year cycle of the sun should be reckoned from the month of Tishrei, since this is the beginning of the new year as it relates to time. However, Birkat Hachammah is reckoned from Nissan. This hints at a deeper relationship between Birkat Hachammah and the season of Passover, the Moed (holiday) of Freedom, which occurs in Nissan. The word \u201cmoed\u201d is usually translated as \u201choliday,\u201d but a moed is much more than a recounting of an historical event. It is an encounter between God and the Jewish people which occurs year by year, one aspect of our enduring relationship with our Creator.[8] The month of Nissan, the \u201chead of all months\u201d[9], is the month in which the foundations of the Jewish Nation are renewed, reaffirmed, and strengthened. The Moed of Freedom celebrates not just the absence of physical slavery, but freedom as an internal state of being. The spiritual energy of freedom is brought back into the world every Nissan. It is within our reach to experience freedom during this time: not just as a commemoration of the Jewish people\u2019s freedom from slavery, but as liberation from all that keeps us from being our best selves as individuals and as a nation![10] Thus, Chazal instructed us to say Birkat Hachammah in the spring, the month of Nissan, around the time of Passover,[11] because our experience of the spring and Passover, can doubly inspire us to rise above the sun, to orient our lives in such a way that they express the deepest ideals of our humanity. Avraham and the Sun The lesson of freedom to serve Hashem, which is so fundamental to Jewish life, really began with the strivings of one man\u2026Avraham. Consider also the following story in two variant forms: When this giant [Avraham] was weaned, he began to roam around in his mind, while he was still small, and began to think by day and by night, and he would wonder, \u201cHow is it possible that this sphere moves constantly without there being a mover, or one to turn it, for it is impossible that it turns itself?\u201d And he had no teacher or source of knowledge but he was sunk among senseless idol worshippers in Ur of the Chaldeans; his parents and the whole people worshipped idols and he worshipped with them. But his mind roamed in search of understanding till he achieved the true way and understood out of his own natural intelligence. He knew there is one God who moves the spheres, who created everything, there is none beside Him. He knew that the whole world was in error and that the cause of their error was that they worshipped idols and images, so that they had lost the truth. Abraham was forty years old when he recognized his Creator\u2026 (Rambam Hilchot Avodah Zara 1:3) And the other version of this story is sourced in a book called the Beith HaMidrash, which is a collection of Midrashim that have no known source. The collection was put together in the late 18th or 19th century: When Avraham was three years old he left the cave[12], he reflected in his heart: who created the heavens, the earth, and myself? He prayed the entire day to the sun. In the evening the sun set in the west and the moon rose in the east. When he saw the moon and the stars surrounding the moon, he said, this is what created the heavens, the earth, and myself, and these stars are it\u2019s ministers and servants, he stood all night long praying to the moon. In the morning the moon had set in the west and the sun rose in the east. He said \u201cthere is no strength in the hands of either of them\u201d, there is a master over them and over me, to him I will pray and prostrate myself. If we, like Avraham, would contemplate creation, we would realize that there is a Creator and that there is only one creation that is truly free, the soul of a human being. Creation is bound by the chains of natural law, the sun rises, the sun sets, day after day after day. Humankind possesses the single most profound power to recognize the Creator and to choose to live \u201cabove the sun.\u201d Creation without man is mute, under the sun, under the force of natural law.[13] But human beings can choose what to say and do, and if you think about what I just said carefully, you will realize that you are the voice of creation. So when we arise Erev Pesach this year to say Birkat HaChammah, may we be blessed with a full illumination that each and every moment of our lives is a blessing and that there is at least one thing new under the sun, that is you when you make this blessing and add your free willed voice to the symphony of creation! [1] Berei**** 1:14-20 [2] Mesechet Shabbat 30b [3] Tanchuma, Berei**** 1 [4] See the Maharal\u2019s Gevurat Hashem 46. [5] Passover is the first moed in the moed cycle, the others in chronological order from Nissan are Shavuot, Rosh Hashannah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and Shemini Atzeret. [6] Shemot12:1,2; Shemot 23:15; Devarim 16:1 [7] Mesechet Rosh HaShannah 2a [8] See Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch\u2019s Horeb paragraph 161, for more on the meaning of Moed. [9] Shemot 12:1,2 [10] See Rabbi Jonathan Sack\u2019s Haggadah, Building a Society of Freedom. [11] Incidentally, this year, Birkat Hachammah falls on Erev Passover, drawing out this idea in a even more striking manner. [12] It is was written that Nimrod sought to kill Avraham, but Avraham was hidden in a cave underground. [13] Which makes miracles all the more powerful, for it shows the mastery of Hashem over all of nature. Ixcatl",

Birkat Hachammah then serves as an expression of our faith in Hashem and a testament against the world view that proclaims that there is only that which is under the sun and an expression of our faith in Hashem. The Time of Our Freedom We are first introduced to the sun in the Book of Berei**** (Genesis), chapter 1 verse 14: \u201cGod said, \u2018Let there be luminaries [the sun, moon, and stars] in the firmament of the heaven to separate between the day and the night; and they shall serve as signs, and for festivals [Moadim], and for days and years.\u2019\u201d This creation of the sun takes place very near the time of the creation of humankind, which, as we know, is celebrated from Tishrei (Rosh Hashanah). Given this, we would expect that the commemoration of the creation of the sun would take place toward the end of Elul. However, we say the blessing in Nissan instead. Why? To understand this, we must recognize the unique nature of Jewish time. We know that the changing seasons of the natural world express the seasons of the spiritual world, the energies of that particular time.[4] Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter tie to the the corresponding festivals and holy days, expressing the spiritual spectrum of man and creation. Because of this, we are commanded to observe Passover[5] in the spring (Aviv),[6] and as a result, the Jewish calendar is a combination of both solar and lunar elements. This ensures that our holidays fall in the appropriate (spiritual) seasons. The Jewish calendar also has four different new years\u2019.[7] The New Moon (Rosh *****sh) of Tishrei is the Rosh Hashanah of the years, i.e., of \u201ctime\u201d and Rosh *****sh Nissan is the New Year of the Moadim (holidays). It would seem that the 28 year cycle of the sun should be reckoned from the month of Tishrei, since this is the beginning of the new year as it relates to time. However, Birkat Hachammah is reckoned from Nissan. This hints at a deeper relationship between Birkat Hachammah and the season of Passover, the Moed (holiday) of Freedom, which occurs in Nissan. The word \u201cmoed\u201d is usually translated as \u201choliday,\u201d but a moed is much more than a recounting of an historical event. It is an encounter between God and the Jewish people which occurs year by year, one aspect of our enduring relationship with our Creator.[8] The month of Nissan, the \u201chead of all months\u201d[9], is the month in which the foundations of the Jewish Nation are renewed, reaffirmed, and strengthened. The Moed of Freedom celebrates not just the absence of physical slavery, but freedom as an internal state of being. The spiritual energy of freedom is brought back into the world every Nissan. It is within our reach to experience freedom during this time: not just as a commemoration of the Jewish people\u2019s freedom from slavery, but as liberation from all that keeps us from being our best selves as individuals and as a nation![10] Thus, Chazal instructed us to say Birkat Hachammah in the spring, the month of Nissan, around the time of Passover,[11] because our experience of the spring and Passover, can doubly inspire us to rise above the sun, to orient our lives in such a way that they express the deepest ideals of our humanity. Avraham and the Sun The lesson of freedom to serve Hashem, which is so fundamental to Jewish life, really began with the strivings of one man\u2026Avraham. Consider also the following story in two variant forms: When this giant [Avraham] was weaned, he began to roam around in his mind, while he was still small, and began to think by day and by night, and he would wonder, \u201cHow is it possible that this sphere moves constantly without there being a mover, or one to turn it, for it is impossible that it turns itself?\u201d And he had no teacher or source of knowledge but he was sunk among senseless idol worshippers in Ur of the Chaldeans; his parents and the whole people worshipped idols and he worshipped with them. But his mind roamed in search of understanding till he achieved the true way and understood out of his own natural intelligence. He knew there is one God who moves the spheres, who created everything, there is none beside Him. He knew that the whole world was in error and that the cause of their error was that they worshipped idols and images, so that they had lost the truth. Abraham was forty years old when he recognized his Creator\u2026 (Rambam Hilchot Avodah Zara 1:3) And the other version of this story is sourced in a book called the Beith HaMidrash, which is a collection of Midrashim that have no known source. The collection was put together in the late 18th or 19th century: When Avraham was three years old he left the cave[12], he reflected in his heart: who created the heavens, the earth, and myself? He prayed the entire day to the sun. In the evening the sun set in the west and the moon rose in the east. When he saw the moon and the stars surrounding the moon, he said, this is what created the heavens, the earth, and myself, and these stars are it\u2019s ministers and servants, he stood all night long praying to the moon. In the morning the moon had set in the west and the sun rose in the east. He said \u201cthere is no strength in the hands of either of them\u201d, there is a master over them and over me, to him I will pray and prostrate myself. If we, like Avraham, would contemplate creation, we would realize that there is a Creator and that there is only one creation that is truly free, the soul of a human being. Creation is bound by the chains of natural law, the sun rises, the sun sets, day after day after day. Humankind possesses the single most profound power to recognize the Creator and to choose to live \u201cabove the sun.\u201d Creation without man is mute, under the sun, under the force of natural law.[13] But human beings can choose what to say and do, and if you think about what I just said carefully, you will realize that you are the voice of creation. So when we arise Erev Pesach this year to say Birkat HaChammah, may we be blessed with a full illumination that each and every moment of our lives is a blessing and that there is at least one thing new under the sun, that is you when you make this blessing and add your free willed voice to the symphony of creation! [1] Berei**** 1:14-20 [2] Mesechet Shabbat 30b [3] Tanchuma, Berei**** 1 [4] See the Maharal\u2019s Gevurat Hashem 46. [5] Passover is the first moed in the moed cycle, the others in chronological order from Nissan are Shavuot, Rosh Hashannah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and Shemini Atzeret. [6] Shemot12:1,2; Shemot 23:15; Devarim 16:1 [7] Mesechet Rosh HaShannah 2a [8] See Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch\u2019s Horeb paragraph 161, for more on the meaning of Moed. [9] Shemot 12:1,2 [10] See Rabbi Jonathan Sack\u2019s Haggadah, Building a Society of Freedom. [11] Incidentally, this year, Birkat Hachammah falls on Erev Passover, drawing out this idea in a even more striking manner. [12] It is was written that Nimrod sought to kill Avraham, but Avraham was hidden in a cave underground. [13] Which makes miracles all the more powerful, for it shows the mastery of Hashem over all of nature. Ixcatl",
