It will be a while before the unit is back to 100% to deploy and do training exercises. Moving over 200 m1a2 Abrams and around 75 Bradlys plus many support vehicles all across the ocean can cause some issues. The unit is not missing just inactive due to the move to a whole different area of operations. By the way Friedberg/Ray Barracks was handed over to the German Army no i repeat no US troops are stationed there so do not waste your money trying to visit.",
