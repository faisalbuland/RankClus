        "quote": "Originally posted by mcgreer: LOL Obama is about as much a socialist as you are. Consider that, if the people you supported hadn't screwed our financial system up so badly with legislation and the appointment of either incompetent or ideologically-driven sycophants, the things proposed to try to arrest the decline of our financial system wouldn't even be necessary. Most rational people do not like what's being prescribed, but because everything got cocked up so badly, there isn't much choice. The biggest mistake this country made was the re-election of the previous President. I find it hilarious how people like you have decided to bury the past eight years down some memory hole. Is it because you lack the courage and honesty to take ownership because of your support of those persons and halfassed philosophies that got this country (and the rest of the planet) into this mess? Socialism. LMAO The best you can do with that term is find something that someone else said about it. You probably have no idea what it even is. I challenge you to define it in your own terms in the context of our current financial situation and the legislation proposed as a result of it.", 
        "reply": " Forget your little \"challenge\", mcgreer. I'm not gonna explain it to you if you're not intelligent enough to see what's happening right in front of your eyes. Do you just take every word B.O. utters as gospel without bothering to compare it to the facts, mcgreer? Cause I really don't see how you could believe as you do otherwise. So go ahead and continue to \"LMAO\" and blame GW Bush for everything that goes wrong during King Prez Barry's term, since you can't seem to blame the man for his own mistakes. I'm sure that has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that he's (half) black, right?

Consider that, if the people you supported hadn't screwed our financial system up so badly with legislation and the appointment of either incompetent or ideologically-driven sycophants, the things proposed to try to arrest the decline of our financial system wouldn't even be necessary. Most rational people do not like what's being prescribed, but because everything got cocked up so badly, there isn't much choice. The biggest mistake this country made was the re-election of the previous President. I find it hilarious how people like you have decided to bury the past eight years down some memory hole. Is it because you lack the courage and honesty to take ownership because of your support of those persons and halfassed philosophies that got this country (and the rest of the planet) into this mess?

Do you just take every word B.O. utters as gospel without bothering to compare it to the facts, mcgreer? Cause I really don't see how you could believe as you do otherwise. So go ahead and continue to \"LMAO\" and blame GW Bush for everything that goes wrong during King Prez Barry's term, since you can't seem to blame the man for his own mistakes. I'm sure that has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that he's (half) black, right? By the way, if you really think that B.O.'s no socialist, I suggest you read some of what he's written, (before he began campaigning), on constitutional principles etc.",
