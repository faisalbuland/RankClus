The Democratic Party registered a 48% approval rating in the same poll. At this time, there is a 68% approval rating for Mr. Obama peronally and a 60% approval rating for his six-week performance as president. An interview with Michael Steele, chairman of the RNC, focused on the current \"leadership debate\" within Republican ranks, notably between Steele and Rush Limbaugh. Steele was politically evasive in avoiding any direct answers regarding this week's \"rhubarb\" between the two other than Steele admitting that he did not handle the situation well. It appears to me that Limbaugh has deftly filled a leadership vacuum in the Republican ranks following the devastating presidential and Congressional losses in November and given that he has an established, loyal radio audience that is frustrated by the lack of any effective Republican counterstrategy to the Democrats (Just say \"no\" amply sums it up) or any inspiring party leadership. Given his perch as a talk show host without any meaningful responsibilities beyond his daily broadcasting, Limbaugh has effectively emasculated an already faltering and stumbling Republican leadership. In his attacks on both the Obama administration and the Republican leadership, Limbaugh has ably splintered what little unity remained in the Republican ranks after last fall's elections. It's very easy to be destructive; let's see if Limbaugh is capable of genuine political \"heavy lifting\" -- providing appealing and constructive alternative strategies to the Democratic platform well in place now. With his characteristic self-centered approach and focus on his favorite person -- himself -- and life long avoidance of any meaningful contributions beyond himself, it seems that Limbaugh would be a more worthy successor to continue Sigmund Freud's personality studies (id, ego, superego) than qualified for actual political work needed in the Republican Party.",

The Democratic Party registered a 48% approval rating in the same poll. At this time, there is a 68% approval rating for Mr. Obama peronally and a 60% approval rating for his six-week performance as president. An interview with Michael Steele, chairman of the RNC, focused on the current \"leadership debate\" within Republican ranks, notably between Steele and Rush Limbaugh. Steele was politically evasive in avoiding any direct answers regarding this week's \"rhubarb\" between the two other than Steele admitting that he did not handle the situation well. It appears to me that Limbaugh has deftly filled a leadership vacuum in the Republican ranks following the devastating presidential and Congressional losses in November and given that he has an established, loyal radio audience that is frustrated by the lack of any effective Republican counterstrategy to the Democrats (Just say \"no\" amply sums it up) or any inspiring party leadership. Given his perch as a talk show host without any meaningful responsibilities beyond his daily broadcasting, Limbaugh has effectively emasculated an already faltering and stumbling Republican leadership. In his attacks on both the Obama administration and the Republican leadership, Limbaugh has ably splintered what little unity remained in the Republican ranks after last fall's elections. It's very easy to be destructive; let's see if Limbaugh is capable of genuine political \"heavy lifting\" -- providing appealing and constructive alternative strategies to the Democratic platform well in place now. With his characteristic self-centered approach and focus on his favorite person -- himself -- and life long avoidance of any meaningful contributions beyond himself, it seems that Limbaugh would be a more worthy successor to continue Sigmund Freud's personality studies (id, ego, superego) than qualified for actual political work needed in the Republican Party.",

Obama is trying to install Health Care that will \"ration\" my ability to see a Doctor of my Choice and ration my access to medical care! Obama has broken several pledges; e.g., - pledge that \"no earmarks\" would be in legislation he signs; - pledge for Government Openness (Largest Spending Bill in our History) was negotiated in secrecy; - and, pledge to place \"legislation\" for 5 days on the internet so all could read them before signature. I hope America succeeds! America will succeed! Americans will retain their rights to \"Own a Gun!\" Doctors will retain the right of a \"moral objection\" to certain procedures. Republicans have a \"reasonable\" chance of success in stoping Obama's plan to disallow many current income tax deductions and the imposition of Carbon \"Cap and Trade\" Programs; which would; - raise individual taxes (by way of Gasoline taxes); - raise taxes on energy production plants, water suppliers (and so on) causing those costs to be passed on to you and I (the consumers).

Given his perch as a talk show host without any meaningful responsibilities beyond his daily broadcasting, Limbaugh has effectively emasculated an already faltering and stumbling Republican leadership.

It's very easy to be destructive; let's see if Limbaugh is capable of genuine political \"heavy lifting\" -- providing appealing and constructive alternative strategies to the Democratic platform well in place now. With his characteristic self-centered approach and focus on his favorite person -- himself -- and life long avoidance of any meaningful contributions beyond himself, it seems that Limbaugh would be a more worthy successor to continue Sigmund Freud's personality studies (id, ego, superego) than qualified for actual political work needed in the Republican Party.",
