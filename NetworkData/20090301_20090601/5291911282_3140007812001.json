We were told that the orders would be given when we arrived but not to worry they were approved and granted. We assumed that was the case and before we know it the week is up and no orders but the promise they would still be coming. In the end the orders never came and we were paid with \"ADA\" pay for the days we attended but we were never paid for our travel (gas, lodging, food, etc...). Has anyone been in a situation like this before or know what course we need to take to get our pay.",

I've also been in similar situations and got bent over about it. The money may not come through patient waiting...go through your CoC. Your Command Sergeant Major should help you (Soldier Care is supposedly a big issue for them) I was told that my orders were approved by a Commissioned Officer, apparently that was my fault. I was later told that I never should have left without confirmed orders in my hand listing the exact pay status (AT, ADT, ADSW, AFTP, etc...) they all get paid differently. My argument was that the Officer who told me in effect made it an order, Spoken or Written, What's the Difference? Obey orders of all officers appointed over me. Some reason I remember that from somewhere. Someone, (NOT sure who) made a call to the Inspector General's office on my behalf...and SHAZAAM...money in my account after about nine months. Good luck I've heard cases of family members calling Congress members for resolution, I've never gone that far before...dunno that I'd recommend it.",

There's generally at least a month's gap between the bill being due, and the pay office getting around to paying it. Meanwhile you are on the hook. REALLY sucks if you don't get mail but once every three weeks, so you don't know that you're on your third notice. (Fort Drum has a serious issue with getting mail out to people.) First notice you get is the third notice threatening your credit score. I've had a lot of problems with one TDY trip we were scheduled for. They ran out of seats for our original course, so they rescheduled us for one a month later. Two YEARS later, as I was separating from Active Duty, I received an e-mail stating that I owed for the trip I never went on, I guess because travel pay office never cancelled it. So I did not get my last month's pay, or final pay, just a big fat NO PAY DUE. I challenged this, of course, but it took some time to go through. They said I had debt about four months ago, and this past week they said they cancelled that debt. So now it's time to wait to get re-imbursed for all the money they took out of my paycheck. That might take a while. My basic point is, you need to stay pro-active. This won't necessarily fix itself (although it might.) Bring it up with your chain of command. If you have any kind of documentation, give them a copy. I forwarded EVERY AKO e-mail I received pertaining to both the trip that was re-scheduled, and the trip I went on, to my platoon sergeant. There must have been twenty e-mails, dating back two years.",
