It has failed only because we have compromised our position with free and unfair trade with China and any other commi nation. So whats the point of picking on little old Cuba? Not that I agree, but I also never agreed nor will ever agree to free and open markets with any country that is not an open nation that does not treat it's people the way our constitution is founded and based upon. Can't blame the CBC either, they do speak the truth although it is quite discusting for me to read. We have allowed many to sell out our standards for the all mighty dollar.

Our neighbor next door doesn't care for the restrictions place on communication, donations etc. Her gifts to relations are smuggled by tricks to get away from the 10% off the top to Castro Government. Of course that and tourist will improve their economy that seems to run against the grain of the other 50% and our government that wouldn't give Castro the time of day. One comment is that Fidel seeing his last days and his Brother is somewhat more flexible. Both stirs the inner fires for the lack of freedoms given to the population. After both are long gone the next government might pay more attention to the well being of average hombre. They need auto parts for all those 50' and 60' auto's, the junk dealers are looking for new customers. Won't this leave Hugo a might lonely? Have to admit there are many more rich millionaire Cubans now, than before Fidel. They just happen to reside in Florida and other US cities.",
