Perhaps Caliphate was the wrong term to use, but it does involve a world wide sharia government. There is the 12th Imam. If you don't know, google it.

Ahmadinejad always leaves an empty seat at a table open for the 12th, and usually ends his speaches asking the 12th Imam to give him the strength to bring about his return.

Perhaps Caliphate was the wrong term to use, but it does involve a world wide sharia government. There is the 12th Imam. If you don't know, google it. Ahmadinejad's BIG into the 12th Imam, who is the Shiite messiah. Ahmadinejad always leaves an empty seat at a table open for the 12th, and usually ends his speaches asking the 12th Imam to give him the strength to bring about his return.
