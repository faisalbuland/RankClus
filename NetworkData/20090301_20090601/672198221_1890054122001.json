They then 'deserted' the Russians when the revolution broke out, fighting all comers - including the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia, in an effort to get themselves repatriated. This is well off the subject, but this is, to me, one of the more fascinating weird little stories of WWI. So many odd little political dramas around that time period that people never hear about. Internal poll: how many here knew the US actually invaded Siberia?",
