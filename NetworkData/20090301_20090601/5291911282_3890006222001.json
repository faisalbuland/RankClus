But let\u2019s take Dietl\u2019s hypothetical question a step further. What would happen if we knew the men who staged the kidnapping were members of a world-wide ring of cutthroat terrorists and we had some of their ringleaders in custody? What would happen if members of our intelligence community questioned these terrorists aggressively\u2026 deprived them of sleep, locked them up in a small dark room \u2026 poured some water in their mouths for a few seconds - all in order to coerce them to divulge information that ACTUALLY SAVED THE LIVES of his precious daughters? Do you believe, for one minute, that President Obama would look at these U.S. intelligence agents in utter disgust and say \u201dThank you for saving the lives of my girls but your tactics are never called for under any circumstances. And despite the fact that you were following orders from your superiors, the U.S. Government is going to release the details of everything you did for the whole world to see\u2026 then we might throw you in jail for doing your job.\u201d Do you believe that Obama would retaliate against these U.S. interrogators by publishing photographs of them questioning the terrorists so that other members of this terrorist ring could then retaliate against these interrogators and their families? Well guess what? THAT IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT BARACK OBAMA JUST DID when he chose to release classified legal memos detailing the interrogation techniques used on high value detainees in the aftermath of 9/11 - allowing the possibility of prosecution and certainty of persecution of those involved.

They might even kill them. That would be indescribably bad, no better than terrorists taking them, really. You might very well want to hunt them down and kill them. If you had access to someone with information, you might torture them. If you did, you would face criminal charges. Extenuating circumstances might lessen your sentence, but the charge would still stand. The fact that you had committed a crime would still remain. The rule of law takes justice out of the hands of individuals who, to put it nicely, might not be objective about things they were personally the victims of. It takes reprisal and revenge away and replaces it with a system of society which (ideally) uncovers the truth. Justice is no longer individual, it is societal. (And that's generally a good thing, because when justice was individual it was more often the person with more power that won a case than the person who was innocent.) Terrorism isn't any different. We address the problems posed by terrorists as a society, not as individuals seeking revenge. As individuals we might be tempted to use some pretty nasty tactics if people we loved were harmed. As a society, we should face these problems more objectively, and should not let revenge or reprisal or especially fear unduly impact our decisions.",
