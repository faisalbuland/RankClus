The US government had previously said it would not fight a court ruling ordering the release of the pictures. Mr Obama now believes the release of the photos would make the job of US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan more difficult, White House officials said. The pictures were due to be released by 28 May, according to the court ruling.

The dispute could now end up before the US Supreme Court. Whie House officials said Mr Obama did not feel comfortable with the release of the photographs because he believed their release would endanger US troops, and because the national security implications of such a release had not been fully presented to the court.
