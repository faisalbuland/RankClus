Fact is, it happens all throughout the services. The bonus should not really be the main deciding factor of reenlistment. It should be service of country that comes first.

It would just be nice to be treated fairly. If one area gets a bonus all should, at least one for moral purposes. What my solider or the technicians do is no less imporatant then any other service member. I just get so tired hearing how happy he should be to be in the AGR program...I am still supporting a solider who has deployed multiple times just like any non-AGR soldier. As for my country, well being from a long line of family who have served in every war and conflict this is not a question in my home!!!!! quote: Originally posted by Boilerman_01: There are many who aren't getting bonuses.
