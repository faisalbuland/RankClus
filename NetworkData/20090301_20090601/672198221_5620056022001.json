And are they running for office as well, and being called \"Cheap shysters?\" But I'll bet you're wrong about all the above being appreciated mor than Franken (except Jessica Simpson - I'll give you a bye on her.) Frankens a very funny man when he's doing his act. And he's been in Iraq and Afghanistan, Seven Tiimes. There are some interesting links in the below article quote: Bill O'Reilly, Al Franken and George Clooney Bill O'Reilly continued complaining about the lack of entertainers visiting Afghanistan last night with guests Connie Stevens and Tom Arnold. So far BOR has been able to avoid mentioning Al Franken's USO visits there and interestingly enough, viewers did not hear either Tom Arnold or USO President, Edmund Powell utter Franken's name during their appearances on The Factor. Connie Stevens who has been really out of the spotlight lamented the lack of entertainers volunteering for USO tours. Stevens claimed the new generation of entertainers are more selfish and O'Reilly agreed. Tom Arnold talked about his experiences entertaining the troops in Afghanistan objecting slightly to the suggestion that entertainers are too selfish to go. O'Reilly concluded that the USO needs to be more proactive about recruiting people and once again, Arnold offered a mild objection noting the scheduling issues involved in organizing a tour. Somehow, O'Reilly thinks he can avoid mentioning Franken's visits to Afghanistan in 2003 or 2006. During Arnold's brief defense of entertainers last night, he mentioned that some had even faced the danger of going to Darfur.

Dave How many Republicans could take the time to go to Iraq and entertain our troops? Let's see. Trace Adkins, Toby Keith, Bruce Willis, Brooks and Dunn, Kid Rock, Ted Nugent, Drew Carey, Vince Vaughn, Chuck Norris, and Jessica Simpson to name a few. I bet \"dollars to donuts\" that the troops in Iraq would rather see any of the above celebrities over Al Franken.",

Frankens a very funny man when he's doing his act. And he's been in Iraq and Afghanistan, Seven Tiimes. There are some interesting links in the below article quote: Bill O'Reilly, Al Franken and George Clooney Bill O'Reilly continued complaining about the lack of entertainers visiting Afghanistan last night with guests Connie Stevens and Tom Arnold. So far BOR has been able to avoid mentioning Al Franken's USO visits there and interestingly enough, viewers did not hear either Tom Arnold or USO President, Edmund Powell utter Franken's name during their appearances on The Factor. Connie Stevens who has been really out of the spotlight lamented the lack of entertainers volunteering for USO tours. Stevens claimed the new generation of entertainers are more selfish and O'Reilly agreed. Tom Arnold talked about his experiences entertaining the troops in Afghanistan objecting slightly to the suggestion that entertainers are too selfish to go. O'Reilly concluded that the USO needs to be more proactive about recruiting people and once again, Arnold offered a mild objection noting the scheduling issues involved in organizing a tour. Somehow, O'Reilly thinks he can avoid mentioning Franken's visits to Afghanistan in 2003 or 2006. During Arnold's brief defense of entertainers last night, he mentioned that some had even faced the danger of going to Darfur.

Frankens a very funny man when he's doing his act. And he's been in Iraq and Afghanistan, Seven Tiimes. There are some interesting links in the below article quote: Bill O'Reilly, Al Franken and George Clooney Bill O'Reilly continued complaining about the lack of entertainers visiting Afghanistan last night with guests Connie Stevens and Tom Arnold. So far BOR has been able to avoid mentioning Al Franken's USO visits there and interestingly enough, viewers did not hear either Tom Arnold or USO President, Edmund Powell utter Franken's name during their appearances on The Factor. Connie Stevens who has been really out of the spotlight lamented the lack of entertainers volunteering for USO tours. Stevens claimed the new generation of entertainers are more selfish and O'Reilly agreed. Tom Arnold talked about his experiences entertaining the troops in Afghanistan objecting slightly to the suggestion that entertainers are too selfish to go. O'Reilly concluded that the USO needs to be more proactive about recruiting people and once again, Arnold offered a mild objection noting the scheduling issues involved in organizing a tour. Somehow, O'Reilly thinks he can avoid mentioning Franken's visits to Afghanistan in 2003 or 2006. During Arnold's brief defense of entertainers last night, he mentioned that some had even faced the danger of going to Darfur. The subject was ignored totally since O'Reilly might have been forced to congratulate George Clooney and Don Cheadle for receiving the prestigious 2007 Peace Summit Award for their work in Darfur. \"http://www.newshounds.us/2007/11/30/bill_oreilly_al_franken_and_george_clooney.php\"",
