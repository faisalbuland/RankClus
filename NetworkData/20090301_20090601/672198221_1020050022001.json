        "content": "From Associated Press: CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2013 The Veterans Affairs Department is investigating whether there's a link between a patient's positive HIV test and unsterilized equipment that may have exposed thousands of veterans to infectious diseases. The positive test was the first reported since the department warned veterans treated at three clinics that they might be at risk. The VA previously reported that hepatitis was found in 16 patients, but the agency cautioned there was no way to prove that the patients contracted the illnesses because of treatment at their facilities. In an e-mail late Friday, the agency said it was investigating \"the possibility of such a relationship.\" The VA earlier this year warned more than 10,000 veterans to get blood tests because they could have been exposed to contamination while getting colonoscopies in Murfreesboro, Tenn., and Miami. The endoscopic equipment in question was also used at an ear, nose and throat facility in Augusta, Ga. All three sites failed to properly sterilize the equipment between treatments. The VA has said it does not yet know if veterans who were treated with the same kind of equipment at its other 150 hospitals may have been exposed to the same mistake before the department had a nationwide safety training campaign. An agency spokeswoman has said the VA is certain the mistake with the equipment was corrected nationwide by March 14. The problems dated back for more than five years at the Murfreesboro and Miami hospitals. So far, less than a third \u2014 3,174 \u2014 have been notified of their test results. The agency also is trying to locate patients whose warning letters were returned. \"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090407/ap_on_he_me/veterans_colonoscopies\"",
