Lebanon(Syria's de Facto Puppet) cant control it's own people from attacking the Izzy's and gets spanked Hamas makes treaties then attacks again & again..... How arrogant must 0bama be to think he will change this. No American President is capable of changing it. As long as the fundamental equation- the Right of Israel to exist isnt agreed to in real faith, nothing will change. And yet in recent history, the only President who didn't really try was GW...now that's arrogance. You are right about one thing though...without Palestine agreeing to Israel's right to exist, peace won't happen till they're all dead! You mean other than calling for a Palestinian State in a speech delivered 4-2-2002 and reinterated many times since then such as on 11-29-07, 1-11-08, 5-17-08 and hosting talks between the Palestinians and Israel?

Maybe it will turn into a nice ground war with Iraq between the two major combatants. That would work out well for our troops on the ground wouldn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s open another front. Of course we\u2019ll need the pharmaceutical companies to increase production of oxycontin, antidepressants, sleeping pills and antipsychotic for the additional redeployments but what the hell, it\u2019s less politically risky than reinstating the draft. Or We could continue pursuing a diplomatic solution that involves a Palestinian state living in relative peace with Israel. Iran brought this on to themselves....They will not negotiate, the hardliners are too powerful and ambitious to see the stupidity of their ways.. NO ONE wants Iran with nuclear weapons, Not Israel, not the US and especially not the Arab states, one of which was reminded recently that it has \"historically\" been a \"province\" of Iran: Bahrain.... Netenyahu will not hesitate to attack if he feels the point of no return has been reached, I can promise you this... It will be a painful and costly option to forcfully end their nuclear program, but the alternative is not an option..",

And yes, there will be no movement until the Palestinians can speek with one voice and say Israel, as do we, has the right to exist. IMHO the Palestinians can not even agree as to who speeks for them or who is in charge. The fractured politic infrastructure they have will never permit progress until they can become one. Up until the Bush administration, the settlements were regarded as an impossible roadblock to peace. Mr. Bush changed that policy, and regards the settlements as perfectly ok. There can be no two State solution without the removal of the settlements. I agree that Israel should make no agreement until their existance is recognised - But equally true, can be no Palestinian State with these settlements. Mr. Bush was well aware of that - And his speeches were empty air, and meant for US consumption. Dave",
