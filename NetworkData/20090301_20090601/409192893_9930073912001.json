Every Russian wish some song for you to listen. skytail, with all due respect, what are you trying to understand about Americans? If you are trying to formulate better relations bewteen Russian and America, then I applaud you for doing so. Personally, I've always been a fan of military marching music, from all over the world. Somewhere in my collection, I've got \"Red Army Chorus on Parade.\" But I haven't listened to it in years. My guess is that the Russian Federation Army retained some of the old Soviet march songs, because some were traditional and not political. Many of these march songs were peformed by the Orchestra of the Regimental Garrison at Moscow, during the USSR period. Two that I recall from memory that I enjoyed, were \"Meadowlands,\" and \"March of the Don Cossacks.\" This message has been edited.
