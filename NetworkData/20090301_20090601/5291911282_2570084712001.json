The pony gave it a soft kick to send it on its way, so it went over and started smelling/trying to nuzzle on the wall of a shed. Its mother, a palomino was also lying on the ground, and trying to watch, but she kept dozing off like someone in church. Every time the side of her head would touch the ground, she would jerk up and look around, then start tipping over again - all the time the colt is now chewing on the siding. Finally, she rolled all the way onto her back in the dust with her feet straight up, then she crashed out flat - gone... But not for long. The motion caught the colts attention, and he was soon over trying to chew her ear - - Wandering and Wondering",
