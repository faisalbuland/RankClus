May God Bless any WWII Vets still active on this site. I didn't forget, nor will I ever. If you took a poll, most that post here didn't forget either. I suspect you didn't search long on military.com, because I saw plenty of rememberances on Military.com.

Time of Remembrance and Reconciliation for Those Who Lost Their Lives during the Second World War 8 May 2009 By its resolution A/RES/59/26 of 22 November 2004, the General Assembly declared 8 and 9 May as a time of remembrance and reconciliation, and invited Member States, United Nations bodies, nongovernmental organizations and individuals to observe annually either one or both of those days in an appropriate manner, to pay tribute to all those who lost their lives in the Second World War. source-+++http://www.un.org.cn/cms/p/news/29/426/calendar_content.html Let me educate you on a couple of things... \"SKIN\" does a thorough and complete search before he initiates a posting/replies to a post...I know him that well... So, your 'suspicions' don't hold water. Also...his 'signature line' preceeds many on this site...and speaks volumes... He is a unique and unconventional person in his own right... He and I have been here about the same length of time...a few days difference... Also, I hold him in high regard and respect...and his postings have always been 'on target' and 'on the mark'... He and I don't agree on many things...but, that's a normal, everyday thing... But, we do share a few things that override our differences... And they supercede all else on this site... You question him...you question me. I forsee my usefullness and continued presence on this site to be running out... Apologies to the Moderators...I felt that I had to post an rebuttal to his posting... No One...I repeat, NO ONE, posts the above...I know \"SKIN\" can take care of himself; but...you know...\" Hoffy1951, I've known of you for close to 3 years, never had a cross word with you and won't start now. I apologize to you if I offended you and will be happy to apologize to SKINx35. My post was not to be decisive nor offensive, I just didn't agree with all of it. I pointed out that there is plenty on Military.com about VE-Day. I think his motto is lame, that's my opinion. I meant no disrespect to either you nor him, just voiced my opinion. Robert",
