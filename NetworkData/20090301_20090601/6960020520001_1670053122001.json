Frost asks if the dividing line between, for example, a police burglary and the murder of an antiwar protester is only the president\u2019s judgment?

Frost asks if the dividing line between, for example, a police burglary and the murder of an antiwar protester is only the president\u2019s judgment? Nixon agrees, and adds: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing specific that the Constitution contemplates in that respect. I haven\u2019t read every word, every jot and every ****le, but I do know this: That it has been, however, argued that as far as a president is concerned, that in war time, a president does have certain extraordinary powers which would make acts that would otherwise be unlawful, lawful if undertaken for the purpose of preserving the nation and the Constitution, which is essential for the rights we\u2019re all talking about.\u201d [Time, 5/30/1977; Reston, 2007, pp. 102-105; Landmark Cases, 8/28/2007]",

Mr. Eland is highlighting the current moral and political dilemmas stemming from a Bush/Cheney decision to \"push the [legal] envelop\" as-it-were regarding treatment of prisoners who did not \"enjoy\" the protection of an exiting nation-state. The efforts of the Bush/Cheney Administration to reinterpret and/or redefine Executive authority (ala Unitary Executive Theory) never stood the test of our courts because Bush/Cheney assumed they, acting on their assumptions of Executive authority, were not subject to judicial review. Hamdan v Rumsfeld is and example of what can happen when some of these decisions do make it into the courtroom. Rule-Of-Law requires enforcement. Enforcement requires courtrooms, judges and juries. Investigate. And if the investigation shows a crime was committed, prosecute. Nixon most famously said, \"If the President does it, that means it\u2019s not illegal.\"* My guess is that those believing in the Unitary Executive Theory (e.g. Cheney, Alito) agree with this.

Regardless, I don't think I'm the only one who regards this comment as both crazy and dangerous. *Interviewer David Frost has a difficult time with his subject, former President Richard Nixon, in the day\u2019s early questioning (see April 6, 1977). Frost attempts to recoup with a line of questioning suggested by his adviser James Reston, Jr., one used in the trial of former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman (see January 1, 1975). Were there no limits to what a president can do, even if the president wants to do something plainly illegal? he asks. Could he do anything despite the law? Burglary? Forgery? Even murder? \u201cIf the president does it, that means it\u2019s not illegal,\u201d Nixon retorts. \u201cNever had his imperialism been so baldly stated,\u201d Reston will later reflect. Frost asks if the dividing line between, for example, a police burglary and the murder of an antiwar protester is only the president\u2019s judgment? Nixon agrees, and adds: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing specific that the Constitution contemplates in that respect. I haven\u2019t read every word, every jot and every ****le, but I do know this: That it has been, however, argued that as far as a president is concerned, that in war time, a president does have certain extraordinary powers which would make acts that would otherwise be unlawful, lawful if undertaken for the purpose of preserving the nation and the Constitution, which is essential for the rights we\u2019re all talking about.\u201d [Time, 5/30/1977; Reston, 2007, pp. 102-105; Landmark Cases, 8/28/2007]",
