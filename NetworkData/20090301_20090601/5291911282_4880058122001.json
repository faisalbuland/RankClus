If I could have stayed 18-25 for ever Army/Armor would have been my mantra But 30-50, Air Force was definitely more to what a keen brain but an aging body could still handle at a high level of accomplishment Both have become very technical, so it's sixes and sevens - - Must be based on what your body and brain can take - and on what YOU want...

The Army just does a lot more of going looking for it face to face - - Absolutely great post, as usual, GWG. Bro, which branch you choose is up to you. It's not that we will not help you shape your decision, just that we really cannot. It all comes down to what you want to do, what you're good at, and your reasons for enlisting. As GWG says, the AF is more technical; the Army is a bit more demanding. But if you don't love what you do, anything will be suffering. The question you need to ask yourself is what you want the military to do for you. It's altruistic to want to serve, but you have to also question the value you're getting for your time served. To what civilian career do you foresee yourself? Do you want to buff up, work hard, and sweat your days away to build character? Then chances are that the Army is your gig. If you want to get lots of free college and education in a trade that helps you in your civilian career, such as computers, then the AF is likely your best bet. That's not to say that the Army cannot train you in technical things or that the Air Force won't help you grow as you want. But when you're gambling on numbers, you protect your investment as best as possible. Tell us about what you WANT to do. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
