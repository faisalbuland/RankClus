        "content": "Tony Blankley turns the \"Bush lied, people died...\" canard on Obama, but points out that in Obama's case, he is actually lying: quote: I am trying to capture the spirit of bipartisanship as practiced by the Democratic Party over the last eight years. Thus, I have chosen as my lead, the proposition: Obama lied; the economy died. Obviously, I am borrowing this from the Democratic Party theme of 2003-08: \"Bush lied, people died.\" There are, of course, two differences between the two slogans. In the age of Barack Obama, there is little more important than maintaining the integrity of our language - against the onslaught of Orwellian language abuse that is already a babbling brook, and will soon be a cataract of verbal deception. The other difference is that George W. Bush didn't lie about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He was merely mistaken. Whereas President Obama told a whopper last week when he claimed he was not for bigger government. As he said Tuesday night: \"As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets. Not because I believe in bigger government - I don't.\" Consider also his assertion in his not-quite-State of the Union address that: \"My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. But we're starting with the biggest lines. We have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade.\" But, lamentably, a few days later, The Washington Post reported: \"A senior administration official acknowledged yesterday that the budget does not contain $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. Instead, the figure represents Obama's total efforts at deficit reduction, including tax hikes [of more than $1 trillion] on families making over $250,000 a year. It also includes hundreds of billions of dollars 'saved' by not continuing to spend $170 billion a year in Iraq.\" Only a big government man would think of calling a trillion-dollar tax increase a spending cut or \"saving.\" Technically, of course, it is true. A trillion-dollar tax increase will reduce spending by a trillion dollars for those private citizens who were taxed. And, from the perspective of the federal government, a trillion dollars taxed is a trillion dollars saved from the greed of the taxpayers who produced the wealth - and might well want to spend or invest it in non governmental activities.

I heard Jindal, he was talking about giving unemployment benefits to part time employees and how after the federal money stopped they would be forced to continue. That is nonsense and the governor is playing politics. Fact is that when the money stops, the program stops because it would no longer be needed. He is going to have to work harder then that. It should be noted that the good governor is going to refuse $90 million out of an estimated $3.5 billion. Hardly a major statement of principle. This message has been edited.

I heard Jindal, he was talking about giving unemployment benefits to part time employees and how after the federal money stopped they would be forced to continue. That is nonsense and the governor is playing politics. Fact is that when the money stops, the program stops because it would no longer be needed. He is going to have to work harder then that. It should be noted that the good governor is going to refuse $90 million out of an estimated $3.5 billion. Hardly a major statement of principle. This message has been edited.

        "quote": "How is forcing states to spend on social welfare programs going to help the economy... when the fed stops coming up with those funds?", 
        "reply": " Like to see the details of that. I heard Jindal, he was talking about giving unemployment benefits to part time employees and how after the federal money stopped they would be forced to continue. That is nonsense and the governor is playing politics. Fact is that when the money stops, the program stops because it would no longer be needed. He is going to have to work harder then that. It should be noted that the good governor is going to refuse $90 million out of an estimated $3.5 billion. Hardly a major statement of principle. This message has been edited.
