Air Farce !!!!! get your head out of your BUTTTTT! B-2 cost is irrelevant since we are not buying any more of them. Current force is only 20 airframes and by itself, is not sufficient. Yes, very expensive especially after procurement dropped from 300 to 132 to 75 to 21. B-1 enetered service in the mid 80s. Will be 40+ years old by the time it is replaced. Design dates to early 70s. B-52H entered service 62/63/64 timeframe. They will be approaching 60+ years old when they are replaced. Design dates to late 40s! How long do you want the USAF to fly current fleet? Pull their head out of their azz? How about you looking at requirements versus spouting off, that would be a start. Next bomber would come after at least the first batch of new tankers. KC-135 replacement is current number one procurement priority. Now if we could get Congress, DoD, and the USAF all on the same page and get it done. I am against splitting the KC-X as it will do nothing but increase costs. Buy the 767 to replace the KC-135E models and let KC-Y and KC-Z address the MRTT requirement.",

Hide and watch for it is coming faster than you can imagine, and that is the truth too! F22 - good points about the YC-14 and -15. They would have been a good addition. Yep, the C-5B was strictly a political decisions. At least that is what we were briefed by our wing CC at Dover 25 or so years ago. When the last L-1011 rolled off the line it had a sign attached to the tailcone which said \"Thank You C-5B\". But remember when the C-5B was bought, C-5s were still priority B assets and considered national treasures by congress. Considering how we flew the wings (litterally and among other issues) off the C-141s, the C-17 was a good acft at the right time and is very good replacement for the C-141. I do not see a tactical airframe such as the FB-22 being the Next Generation Bomber, too few weapons and too little range. While it would be a nice asset to have, it would not meet the RFP standards IMHO. A B-1R was floated, but that too has gone in the \"decent idea but not what we want\" pile. The USAF wants an acft with long loiter time and extreme regional and/or intercontinental range with a 40,000 lb or more load IIRC. Something that could be stationed outside immediate conflict zone and operate with minimal tanker support. One thing that on-going operations has shown is that an acft with the capabilities of a B-1B is an incredible asset that can stay aloft for a long time and respond quickly.",

We must have a deterant capable of fast response in this milinum with the global threats of today. We need to maintain mobility necessary to move personnel and equipment anywhere in the world on short notice and to protect ourselves of any type of air assults.",

The plane is amazing, it will haul virtually anything to almost any airstrip and it has the range to get it there faster and with less support than a C-17. Yet the Air Force has never kept parts for it in the system, so when even minor maintenance is needed the plane gets stuck waiting for the part from CONUS. The C-17 is a fine medium airlifter, but with the limitations in height added with center wing tank it will never be able to replace the C-5. I would love to see a C-17 haul some of the loads the C-5 can carry, like two MH-53s. Yes, FRED can haul a lot of things a long way. But even with proper parts available, they still took an incredible amount of maintenance hours per flight hour, somewhere around 22-24 when I worked them. Lack of parts and cannabalization just made matters worse. Its sheer size also makes some maintenance in the field somewhat challanging. And can very quickly saturate a ramp at a FOB. It is also neat to land at a fighter base(especially one belonging to a sister service or an ally) and ask for gas. They send out a truck with 15K on board and after I was done laughing, I stated I needed 220K or whathaveyou. It also never failed that everytime I needed to pull a panel for access to something it was 20-30 feet in the air (or higher if working the elevators) and fastened with a hundred or so high torque screws. Now where is that darn Johnson bar...... The C-17 was never meant to compete/replace with the C-5. It was meant to complement it and the C-141 and eventually replacing the latter.",
