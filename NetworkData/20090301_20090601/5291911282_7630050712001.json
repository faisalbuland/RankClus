Japan was very impressed by that - - The game of \"Empire\" is still going - - You are generally correct, but, Japan was not in the discovery and development game, so they were not interested if oil was in Veitnam, as China presently is in the South China Sea (Seychelles), As I stated they wanted the bases to control the supply routes. BTW, The \"HMS Repulse\" and \"HMS King George the 5th\" were sunk on Dec. 8th, 1941, (Dec. 7th Hawaii) by \"Judys\" flown from Tahn Sa Nuht, engaging Great Britain into war. And yes, Rossevelt and the League fo Nations, were disgusted with Japanese atrocities in China,and the US was an oil supplier to Japan, but the embargo was onlyon the Aviation Fuel as Japan lacked the refining capasity to manufacturre high (110) octane avgas. The US High command did not forget the sneak attack Port Aurtur Aurtur, but they assumed that they could never make an attack into a sanctuary like Pearl Harbor, as the harbor was too shallow for a torpedo attack. And yes, the Japanese very well studied Dewey's attack on the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay, but this was not a suprise attack.. You would find that after entering Manila Bay Dewey actually alowed his sailors to have breakfast, then he told Gridly to have at it!! Adm. Isoruku Yammomoto was no fool and he knew the US very well. The idea for the torpedo attack on Pearl was inspired by the British attack on the Italian Fleet in Taranto... The \"Game of Empire\" will always go on, get used to it------ Stoshu",

        "reply": "Reply to greywolfghost (sorry can't get the REply function to work) Yup, Viet Nam was \"French Indo-China\" up until 1954 (Dien Bein Phu). The Japanese decided to take Indo-China, because of the potential oil fields that might be there. Because of the Japanese barbarities in China (Rape of Nanking) Roosevelt decided to cut off both steel and oil supplies to Japan. Since America was the major supplier of both to Japan, that really pushed Tojo into a corner, so the Imperial Staff decided to attach both Indo-China and major holdings of America in the Pacific: The Philippines and Hawaii. The stupid move of the Joint Chiefs to order all the Capital Ships into Pearl Harbor made it too tempting of a target to pass up. America had failed to remember the Japanese's sneak attack on the Russian fleet in Port Arthur in 1909 that destroyed the whole Russian Pacific Fleet. Where did Japan get such an idea??? They had studied very closely America Admiral Dewey's surprise attack on the Spanish Fleet sitting at anchor in Manila Bay At 5:40 with the now famous phrase, \"You may fire when ready, Gridley,\" the Olympia's captain was instructed by Adm. Dewey to begin the barrage that resulted in the destruction of the Spanish fleet, and gave America the Philippines. Japan was very impressed by that - - The game of \"Empire\" is still going - - You are generally correct, but, Japan was not in the discovery and development game, so they were not interested if oil was in Veitnam, as China presently is in the South China Sea (Seychelles), As I stated they wanted the bases to control the supply routes. BTW, The \"HMS Repulse\" and \"HMS King George the 5th\" were sunk on Dec. 8th, 1941, (Dec. 7th Hawaii) by \"Judys\" flown from Tahn Sa Nuht, engaging Great Britain into war. And yes, Rossevelt and the League fo Nations, were disgusted with Japanese atrocities in China,and the US was an oil supplier to Japan, but the embargo was onlyon the Aviation Fuel as Japan lacked the refining capasity to manufacturre high (110) octane avgas. The US High command did not forget the sneak attack Port Aurtur Aurtur, but they assumed that they could never make an attack into a sanctuary like Pearl Harbor, as the harbor was too shallow for a torpedo attack. And yes, the Japanese very well studied Dewey's attack on the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay, but this was not a suprise attack.. You would find that after entering Manila Bay Dewey actually alowed his sailors to have breakfast, then he told Gridly to have at it!! Adm. Isoruku Yammomoto was no fool and he knew the US very well. The idea for the torpedo attack on Pearl was inspired by the British attack on the Italian Fleet in Taranto... The \"Game of Empire\" will always go on, get used to it------ Stoshu",

What did they fly their planes on for 4 years after we cut off their oil - water? Well, yes. The Zero had a manifold water injection system that gave it far superior performance. Not until America captured a flyable one in the Aleutians did we have any clue on how to fight the thing! These are the same people who built 8 giant aircraft carriers and as many battle ships of enormous size, while we could barely build three carriers, and were still relying on World War I era capital ships. The Japanese needed territory and resources, and they were quite capable of developing both. Their big mistake was one of biting off too much to chew - or not enough. They should have taken Indo China and left the Philippines and Hawaii alone, or they should have invaded and taken Hawaii, then take the Philippines and Indo-China later.... Either way, they would have left America strapped for a solution to the problem... As is, they made the same mistake we have made in the Middle East. They started several wars at once, without the certainty of how to supply, fight, and win them. That doomed Japan - What will it do for us? This message has been edited.
