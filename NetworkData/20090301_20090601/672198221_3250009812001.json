Violence in Afghanistan has steadily risen for the past three years as the ousted Taliban has staged a comeback, and President Barack Obama on Friday called the situation in the region \"increasingly perilous,\" more than seven years after the Taliban was removed from power in Afghanistan. The Taliban has re-established control in southern and eastern Afghanistan by providing crude government services and basic security, along with a strong dose of violence to intimidate the population, the official said. It has been able to do so because of insufficient numbers of Afghan, U.S. or NATO forces to counter them, according to U.S. intelligence.
