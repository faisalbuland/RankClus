Over an hour goes by after the initial attacks,in new York, an aide keeps asking cheney do the orders still stand? Norman minetta chairman of the NTSB closed all air traffic and an unauthorized aircraft is approaching Washington, 20 mins out, ten min out, 5 mins out the aid asks again do the orders still stand? Cheney explodes of course the orders still stand have you heard anything different? Hmmmm what were those orders? Whats wrong with this picture? Where were the fighters protecting the air space over washington? For the record being an ex air force vet, its SOP to have 2 fighters At all times on ready alert,Fully armed manned and sitting on a specially designated runway ready to go at a moments notice 24 hours a day every day. At least thats how it was in my time. Our country was under attack for over an hour our leaders were hunkered down with fighters no more tha mins away were not launched protecting the heart of the nation. How could that be possible unless those orders were to stand down? What about wasigtons missile defense system? and worse yet Norman Minettas testimony at the 9/11 commission hearings was not even included in the report. So consider how a plane even got close to the W.H. Then ask yourself honestly does this alone not warrant a full scale investigation?",

Do you realy put any faith or confidence in the two parties and forign interests that run this country? I have to believe there are more honest people in this world seeking truth and justice than the minority perps. Professionals in the sciences and investigative fields whos primary concerns are not political but factual. A hearing Publicly televised for all to wittness. Once they crack a few the house of cards will fold. Offer imunity to some make deals, the information will come forth. Thats what I believe. To believe otherwise as you suggest is to believe justice is no longer attainable and laws are only for the little people as Leona Helmsley once said before she was incarcerated.",
