However, as a long time senior college instructor in a military college program on two large military bases I can understand the young female instructor's concern. Some students will \"bully\" instructors and make similar threats (but it is nearly impossible to get an instructor fired.) Students can get kicked out of college for doing that. Is your concern that the young man depicted is a veteran? I don't think veteran's have a monopoly on being obnoxious. BTW, females seem to be more confrontational about grades than males, but that's just my observation. I'd assume Penn State has had similar problems?? I suppose this is a training video for newer instructors, similar sounding literature appears in many college 'instructors handbooks'. What do you see is going on in the video, athos20?

It seems that they are looking for an avenue to remove the Veteran if that Vet forms a differing opinion. It has been widely known for many years that the college campus is not exactly the friendliest atmosphere for a Veteran Male or Female. I'm glad that our freedom of expression, the right to assemble, Free Speech are all protected by the constitution. It makes it easier for the Veteran to explain there position without being roasted and silenced. Veterans are the witness to what really happened and the so called \"High Educators\" can't tell you something that didn't happen if you were there. If your a Veteran on a Campus somewhere in this country then hold your head high because you were serving your country when the majority of dirtbags surrounding you were playing HALO, raiding Mom and Dad's Fridge for Twinkies, Yougurt tubes and cookies and living high on the Family TiT.
