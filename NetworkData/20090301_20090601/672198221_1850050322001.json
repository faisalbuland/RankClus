It was and is awful how they disrespect Bush. Sure he made mistakes but like Obama has not? Or Clinton, Or Carter? Come on! It takes two to tango and both sides have and will mess up. I think the media is out of line for not being harder on Obama and questioning him more. I don't mind them praising him for the good stuff, but what they let Obama get away they never would have sat silent with Bush. We have moved on to the next President and the Dems still want to go back and drag Bush out in the street. It is fine if you want to say, we are in now and we change the rules, but you don't go back and try and put a guy or his staff in jail for keeping the country safe for 7 years. Shoot, they want to throw Bush in jail for getting a little water on terrorist who tried to hurt us, and Obama doesn't even ask questions, he just shoots the three pirates in the head.

It was and is awful how they disrespect Bush. Sure he made mistakes but like Obama has not? Or Clinton, Or Carter? Come on! It takes two to tango and both sides have and will mess up. I think the media is out of line for not being harder on Obama and questioning him more. I don't mind them praising him for the good stuff, but what they let Obama get away they never would have sat silent with Bush. We have moved on to the next President and the Dems still want to go back and drag Bush out in the street. It is fine if you want to say, we are in now and we change the rules, but you don't go back and try and put a guy or his staff in jail for keeping the country safe for 7 years. Shoot, they want to throw Bush in jail for getting a little water on terrorist who tried to hurt us, and Obama doesn't even ask questions, he just shoots the three pirates in the head.

It was and is awful how they disrespect Bush. Sure he made mistakes but like Obama has not? Or Clinton, Or Carter? Come on! It takes two to tango and both sides have and will mess up. I think the media is out of line for not being harder on Obama and questioning him more. I don't mind them praising him for the good stuff, but what they let Obama get away they never would have sat silent with Bush. We have moved on to the next President and the Dems still want to go back and drag Bush out in the street. It is fine if you want to say, we are in now and we change the rules, but you don't go back and try and put a guy or his staff in jail for keeping the country safe for 7 years. Shoot, they want to throw Bush in jail for getting a little water on terrorist who tried to hurt us, and Obama doesn't even ask questions, he just shoots the three pirates in the head.

It is fine if you want to say, we are in now and we change the rules, but you don't go back and try and put a guy or his staff in jail for keeping the country safe for 7 years.
