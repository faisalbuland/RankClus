        "content": "Obama tax plan: Democrats push back By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney.com senior writer Last Updated: March 5, 2009: 10:49 AM ET To pay for half of his $634 billion health reform fund, Obama has proposed limiting deductions for high-income taxpayers starting in 2011. Instead of using their top income tax rate to calculate the value of a deduction, single filers making more than $200,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000 wouldn't be allowed to reduce their bill by any more than 28% of a given deduction. That's below what the top two tax rates would be in 2011. That means the value of some of the most popular deductions -- such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions -- would be reduced for high-income filers. At a hearing Wednesday, Finance Chairman Max Baucus told Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that he questioned the \"viability\" of the itemized deduction proposal and suggested the administration find another way to help pay for its health reform fund. Also: Two Democrats urge Obama to veto spending bill CNN updated 1:13 a.m. EST, Thu March 5, 2009 WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two Senate Democrats urged President Obama Wednesday to veto a $410 billion spending bill and said they are going to vote against it, criticizing it for its cost and for including too many personal pet projects. I don't think we should pass it [spending bill] this way,\" Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, said on CNN's The Situation Room Wednesday. \"[I'd like] to have the president veto it and say 'clean it up, do it over.'\" Feingold added: \"If that doesn't happen I think he should ... lay down a policy and [say] 'OK, this was stuff from last year ... but from now on don't send me appropriations bills with earmarks or I'll send it back to you.' I would love to see him say that.\" The legislation in question is an omnibus bill that would keep the federal government running through the rest of the fiscal year, which ends in September 2009. The legislation includes $7.7 billion in earmarks, which are unrelated pet projects that members of Congress insert in spending bills. Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Indiana, said those who vote in favor of the bill \"jeopardize their credibility.\" \"But the bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one, least of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem and hastens the day of reckoning,\" Bayh wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial published Wednesday. \"Voters rightly demanded change in November's election, but this approach to spending represents business as usual in Washington, not the voters' mandate.\"",

AND a local supermarket pharmacy now sells some generic drugs for $5 for a 30 day supply and $9 for a 90 day supply. That's less then the VA that has the buying power of the US Government. BTW, if your employer does contribute to your medical insurance Obama wants to tax that and your contribution as ordinary income. Esentually a tax increase on the employed.

There was a news story the other night that thousands of claimes mailed to the VA were not opened 6 months after the post mark. I'm lucky in that my employer has a group plan and contributes to the premium. I don't have to rely on the VA. AND a local supermarket pharmacy now sells some generic drugs for $5 for a 30 day supply and $9 for a 90 day supply. That's less then the VA that has the buying power of the US Government. BTW, if your employer does contribute to your medical insurance Obama wants to tax that and your contribution as ordinary income. Esentually a tax increase on the employed. The extra money will be used to provide FREE health care to those not employed.",

        "content": "Obama tax plan: Democrats push back By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney.com senior writer Last Updated: March 5, 2009: 10:49 AM ET To pay for half of his $634 billion health reform fund, Obama has proposed limiting deductions for high-income taxpayers starting in 2011. Instead of using their top income tax rate to calculate the value of a deduction, single filers making more than $200,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000 wouldn't be allowed to reduce their bill by any more than 28% of a given deduction. That's below what the top two tax rates would be in 2011. That means the value of some of the most popular deductions -- such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions -- would be reduced for high-income filers. At a hearing Wednesday, Finance Chairman Max Baucus told Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that he questioned the \"viability\" of the itemized deduction proposal and suggested the administration find another way to help pay for its health reform fund. Also: Two Democrats urge Obama to veto spending bill CNN updated 1:13 a.m. EST, Thu March 5, 2009 WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two Senate Democrats urged President Obama Wednesday to veto a $410 billion spending bill and said they are going to vote against it, criticizing it for its cost and for including too many personal pet projects. I don't think we should pass it [spending bill] this way,\" Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, said on CNN's The Situation Room Wednesday. \"[I'd like] to have the president veto it and say 'clean it up, do it over.'\" Feingold added: \"If that doesn't happen I think he should ... lay down a policy and [say] 'OK, this was stuff from last year ... but from now on don't send me appropriations bills with earmarks or I'll send it back to you.' I would love to see him say that.\" The legislation in question is an omnibus bill that would keep the federal government running through the rest of the fiscal year, which ends in September 2009. The legislation includes $7.7 billion in earmarks, which are unrelated pet projects that members of Congress insert in spending bills. Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Indiana, said those who vote in favor of the bill \"jeopardize their credibility.\" \"But the bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one, least of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem and hastens the day of reckoning,\" Bayh wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial published Wednesday. \"Voters rightly demanded change in November's election, but this approach to spending represents business as usual in Washington, not the voters' mandate.\"",

The crusade against offshore tax havens is just one among many Obama initiatives that will have the effect of increasing business costs and reducing returns for investors.

Other proposed policies would further increase the cost of doing business, such as \"green\" mandates. A proposed \"card-check\" law is intended to revive compulsory unionism in the private sector and make it more expensive for employers to hire people. When something becomes more expensive, demand is likely to fall. By reducing after-tax returns from investment, Obama will discourage investors from making their funds available. For all practical purposes, investors could go on strike as they did during the 1930s when a succession of soak-the-rich taxes made it hard for investors to estimate their risks and returns, and they remained on the sidelines. Without more capital, it's almost impossible to create more private sector jobs. Obama's populist rhetoric suggests that he's only going after the super-rich.

During the past 15 years, small businesses have been creating over 90% of net new jobs -- altogether, more than 20 million jobs. How smart is it for the heavy hand of government to come down on these employers? This might be a good thing.. With the total implosion of the fed it will leave those of us who CAN take care of ourselves in better shape then those sitting around looking for a handout...
