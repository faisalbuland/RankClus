Peter Heck - Guest Columnist - 4/14/2009 7:50:00 AM As I was sitting in church waiting for the start of the service, my grandpa came walking towards me pointing his finger. No matter how old I get, and no matter how long he's been out of the U.S. Navy, that's still an intimidating sight. As he approached me, his voice quivered as he said, \"We saved that continent twice...how dare my president apologize for this country's arrogance.\" My grandpa is right. Americans need not apologize to the world for their arrogance; rather, Americans should apologize to their forefathers for the arrogance of their president. Barack Obama's first foreign trip as President of the United States has confirmed the naivet\u00e9 so many of us feared during the election cycle. But worse than that, it has also demonstrated that our president suffers from either a complete misunderstanding of our heritage and history, or an utter contempt for it. Neither is excusable. Garnering cheers from the French of all people, President Obama declared, \"In America, there is a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.\" Consider that Obama spoke these words just 500 miles from the beaches of Normandy, where the sand is still stained with 65-year-old blood of \"arrogant Americans.\" Indeed, columnist Mark Whittington observes, \"One should remind Mr. Obama and the Europeans how America has 'shown arrogance' by saving Europe from itself innumerable times in the 20th Century. World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the wars in the Balkans were largely resolved by American blood, treasure, and leadership.\" But all that appears lost on the president's seemingly insatiable quest to mend fences he imagines have been tarnished by the bullish George W. Bush. If Obama wishes to continue trampling the presidential tradition of showing class to former office holders and publicly trash Bush for his own personal gain, so be it. But all Americans should make clear that no man \u2013 even if he is the president \u2013 will tarnish the legacy of those Americans who have gone before us. Ours is not a history of arrogance. It is a history of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. When abusive monarchs repressed the masses, Americans resisted and overthrew them. When misguided policies led to the unjust oppression of fellow citizens, Americans rebelled and overturned them. When millions of impoverished and destitute wretches sought a new beginning, Americans threw open the door and welcomed them. When imperial dictators were on the march, Americans surrendered their lives to stop them. When communist thugs threatened world peace, Americans bled to defeat them. When an entire continent was overwhelmed with famine and hunger, Americans gave of themselves to sustain it. When terrorist madmen killed the innocent and subjugated millions, Americans led the fight to topple them. This is the legacy that generations of Americans have left. If President Obama seeks stronger relations with the world community, perhaps he should begin by reminding them of these very truths, rather than condemning his own countrymen on foreign shores. This \"obsessive need to put down his own country,\" has caused blogger James Lewis to call President Obama a \"stunningly ignorant man\" who has evidently never spoken to a concentration camp survivor, a Cuban refugee, a boat person from Vietnam, a Soviet dissident, or a survivor of Mao's purges. Unfortunately, I can no longer bring myself to give Mr. Obama that benefit of the doubt. Not after looking at the pain in my grandpa's eyes...a man who still carries shrapnel in his body from his service to this country. As a student and teacher of history, I recognize that America has made mistakes...plenty of them, in fact. But one of the great things about our people has been their courage and humility in admitting and correcting those mistakes. God willing, they will prove that willingness again in four years and correct the mistake that is the presidency of Barack Obama.",

        "content": "Well Scott, since you brought up the war situation, here are a few things. First and foremost, I did oppose the Iraq war and I was all for going into A-stan, getting rid of the Taliban and finding OBL. But, that was 8 years ago. Obama said that he was going to begin withdrawing \"most\" troops out of Iraq by August 2010. But, about 50,000 will remain until December 31, 2011. Now, that December 2011 date was actually set by Bush and the Iraqi government, so that one cannot be attributed to my Obama. But, the fact remains that there will still be troops there. And, that will always leave the door open for things to escalate again and I think that will probably happen. Let us not forget that Obama is also sending thousands of troops to A-stan to deal with the Taliban. The only reason we were after the Taliban in the first place was that they were aiding OBL. So, we wanted to get to him through them. But, he went off to P-stan and will probably never be captured. But, the fact remains, the only reason we went to A-stan was to get OBL. He isn't there anymore and the Taliban isn't (and, never was) a threat to us. So, what are we going back to A-stan for this time 8 years later? And, then there is Pakistan. We have been bombing the western border of P-stan ever since Obama took office. What is going on with that? Why are we bombing them? What is our goal in doing so? You like to talk about Bush. OK, that is fine. I never liked the guy, I never voted for him and I think that he was a terrible President. But, Obama is continuing the Bush policies that most everybody despised. Not just the war thing. But, Obama is also spending like an idiot. He is truly making Bush look like a penny-pinching miser is comparison. Also, Obama helped to reinstate the Patriot Act and the warrantless wiretaps. Let's not forget Gitmo. In Obama's Executive Order he said that Gitmo would be shut down within a year. But, he never said a damn thing about rendition. So, that begs the question, why aren't they shutting down Bagram? I will tell you why. Because, that is going to be the same thing as Gitmo, but without the stigma that the name \"Gitmo\" has. So, the detention and torture of the prisoners will continue. Just not in Gitmo. Now, the torture thing. It will still happen, just not by the same players. And, there will be absolutely no prosecution of anybody that has used or designed the guidelines used. This is easily concluded by the fact that he is leaving it up to the Office of the Attorney General to make the call. Hmm, let me see. Who was it that did the fancy bookwork to draft these torture memos? Oh, that's right. The Office of the Attorney General. Sure, the people in the office have changed, but they are not going to eat their own. That is for sure. So, all Obama did by delegating the power of prosecution is basically say that \"we are not going to prosecute anybody\". The same thing that he said a few days before he said that he was going to refer it to Holder. Dude, Obama is not changing a damn thing. He is following the policies of the Bush regime to a T. He is just being a little smarter about it. Which would make sense, because Bush was a dolt.",

First and foremost, I did oppose the Iraq war and I was all for going into A-stan, getting rid of the Taliban and finding OBL. But, that was 8 years ago. Obama said that he was going to begin withdrawing \"most\" troops out of Iraq by August 2010. But, about 50,000 will remain until December 31, 2011. Now, that December 2011 date was actually set by Bush and the Iraqi government, so that one cannot be attributed to my Obama. But, the fact remains that there will still be troops there. And, that will always leave the door open for things to escalate again and I think that will probably happen. Let us not forget that Obama is also sending thousands of troops to A-stan to deal with the Taliban. The only reason we were after the Taliban in the first place was that they were aiding OBL. So, we wanted to get to him through them. But, he went off to P-stan and will probably never be captured. But, the fact remains, the only reason we went to A-stan was to get OBL. He isn't there anymore and the Taliban isn't (and, never was) a threat to us. So, what are we going back to A-stan for this time 8 years later? And, then there is Pakistan. We have been bombing the western border of P-stan ever since Obama took office. What is going on with that? Why are we bombing them? What is our goal in doing so? You like to talk about Bush. OK, that is fine. I never liked the guy, I never voted for him and I think that he was a terrible President. But, Obama is continuing the Bush policies that most everybody despised. Not just the war thing. But, Obama is also spending like an idiot. He is truly making Bush look like a penny-pinching miser is comparison. Also, Obama helped to reinstate the Patriot Act and the warrantless wiretaps. Let's not forget Gitmo. In Obama's Executive Order he said that Gitmo would be shut down within a year. But, he never said a damn thing about rendition. So, that begs the question, why aren't they shutting down Bagram? I will tell you why. Because, that is going to be the same thing as Gitmo, but without the stigma that the name \"Gitmo\" has. So, the detention and torture of the prisoners will continue. Just not in Gitmo. Now, the torture thing. It will still happen, just not by the same players. And, there will be absolutely no prosecution of anybody that has used or designed the guidelines used. This is easily concluded by the fact that he is leaving it up to the Office of the Attorney General to make the call. Hmm, let me see. Who was it that did the fancy bookwork to draft these torture memos? Oh, that's right. The Office of the Attorney General. Sure, the people in the office have changed, but they are not going to eat their own. That is for sure. So, all Obama did by delegating the power of prosecution is basically say that \"we are not going to prosecute anybody\".

He is just being a little smarter about it. Which would make sense, because Bush was a dolt. Well thank you for the briefing major? The big difference is he started out listening to his generals right off the bat and threw this whole torture issue right out in the public arena for debate. Now its being discussed 24/7 from Portland Maine to Honolulu,Hawaii....Its very refreshing...Like Sec.Gates said: The president is a very engaging man. Bush is no Obama...

Peter Heck - Guest Columnist - 4/14/2009 7:50:00 AM As I was sitting in church waiting for the start of the service, my grandpa came walking towards me pointing his finger. No matter how old I get, and no matter how long he's been out of the U.S. Navy, that's still an intimidating sight. As he approached me, his voice quivered as he said, \"We saved that continent twice...how dare my president apologize for this country's arrogance.\" My grandpa is right. Americans need not apologize to the world for their arrogance; rather, Americans should apologize to their forefathers for the arrogance of their president. Barack Obama's first foreign trip as President of the United States has confirmed the naivet\u00e9 so many of us feared during the election cycle. But worse than that, it has also demonstrated that our president suffers from either a complete misunderstanding of our heritage and history, or an utter contempt for it. Neither is excusable. Garnering cheers from the French of all people, President Obama declared, \"In America, there is a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.\" Consider that Obama spoke these words just 500 miles from the beaches of Normandy, where the sand is still stained with 65-year-old blood of \"arrogant Americans.\" Indeed, columnist Mark Whittington observes, \"One should remind Mr. Obama and the Europeans how America has 'shown arrogance' by saving Europe from itself innumerable times in the 20th Century. World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the wars in the Balkans were largely resolved by American blood, treasure, and leadership.\" But all that appears lost on the president's seemingly insatiable quest to mend fences he imagines have been tarnished by the bullish George W. Bush. If Obama wishes to continue trampling the presidential tradition of showing class to former office holders and publicly trash Bush for his own personal gain, so be it. But all Americans should make clear that no man \u2013 even if he is the president \u2013 will tarnish the legacy of those Americans who have gone before us. Ours is not a history of arrogance. It is a history of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. When abusive monarchs repressed the masses, Americans resisted and overthrew them. When misguided policies led to the unjust oppression of fellow citizens, Americans rebelled and overturned them. When millions of impoverished and destitute wretches sought a new beginning, Americans threw open the door and welcomed them. When imperial dictators were on the march, Americans surrendered their lives to stop them. When communist thugs threatened world peace, Americans bled to defeat them. When an entire continent was overwhelmed with famine and hunger, Americans gave of themselves to sustain it. When terrorist madmen killed the innocent and subjugated millions, Americans led the fight to topple them. This is the legacy that generations of Americans have left. If President Obama seeks stronger relations with the world community, perhaps he should begin by reminding them of these very truths, rather than condemning his own countrymen on foreign shores. This \"obsessive need to put down his own country,\" has caused blogger James Lewis to call President Obama a \"stunningly ignorant man\" who has evidently never spoken to a concentration camp survivor, a Cuban refugee, a boat person from Vietnam, a Soviet dissident, or a survivor of Mao's purges. Unfortunately, I can no longer bring myself to give Mr. Obama that benefit of the doubt. Not after looking at the pain in my grandpa's eyes...a man who still carries shrapnel in his body from his service to this country. As a student and teacher of history, I recognize that America has made mistakes...plenty of them, in fact. But one of the great things about our people has been their courage and humility in admitting and correcting those mistakes. God willing, they will prove that willingness again in four years and correct the mistake that is the presidency of Barack Obama. Yes American administrations, right from the start, have made mistakes BUT thanks to the US most of the world speak the language of their choosing, not German or Japanese and there are several million people in Iraq who can now vote, go to school, go to work, get medical care for the first time in 50+ years. Barry the kowtowing apologist needs should have spent more time learning what being an American is all about rather than what \"being black in America\" was all about.",

Then someone asked, \"With no foreign relations experience, how will you deal with radical terrorists?\" And the Pied Piper said, \"Simple. I'll sit down and talk with them and show them how nice we really are and they'll forget that they ever wanted to kill us all!\" Then the Pied Piper said, \"I'll give 95% of you lower taxes.\" *And one, lone voice said, \"But 40% of us don't pay ANY taxes.\" So the Pied Piper said, \"Then I'll give you some of the taxes the fat-cats pay!\" *And the people said, \"Show me the money!\" Then the Pied Piper said, \"I'll tax your Capital Gains when you sell your homes!\" *And the people yawned and the slumping housing market collapsed. And he said, \"I'll mandate employer- funded health care for EVERY worker and raise the minimum wage..\" *And the people said, \"Gim'me some of that!\" Then he said, \"I'll penalize employers who ship jobs overseas.\" *And the people said, \"Where's my rebate check?\" Then the Pied Piper actually said, \"I'll bankrupt the coal industry and electricity rates will skyrocket!\" *And the people said, \"Coal is dirty, coal is evil, no more coal! But we don't care for that part about higher electric rates.\" So the Pied Piper said, \"Not to worry. If your rebate isn't enough to cover your expenses, we'll bail you out.. Just sign up with ACORN and your troubles are over!\" Then he said, \"Illegal immigrants feel scorned and slighted. Let's grant them amnesty, Social Security, free education, free lunches, free medical care, bi-lingual signs and guaranteed housing.\" *And the people said, \"Ole`! Bravo!\" And they made him King! And so it came to pass that employers, facing spiraling costs and ever-higher taxes, raised their prices and laid off workers. Others simply gave up and went out of business and the economy slowed even further. Then the Pied Piper said, \"I am the Messiah and I'm here to save you!

Peter Heck - Guest Columnist - 4/14/2009 7:50:00 AM As I was sitting in church waiting for the start of the service, my grandpa came walking towards me pointing his finger. No matter how old I get, and no matter how long he's been out of the U.S. Navy, that's still an intimidating sight. As he approached me, his voice quivered as he said, \"We saved that continent twice...how dare my president apologize for this country's arrogance.\" My grandpa is right. Americans need not apologize to the world for their arrogance; rather, Americans should apologize to their forefathers for the arrogance of their president. Barack Obama's first foreign trip as President of the United States has confirmed the naivet\u00e9 so many of us feared during the election cycle. But worse than that, it has also demonstrated that our president suffers from either a complete misunderstanding of our heritage and history, or an utter contempt for it. Neither is excusable. Garnering cheers from the French of all people, President Obama declared, \"In America, there is a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.\" Consider that Obama spoke these words just 500 miles from the beaches of Normandy, where the sand is still stained with 65-year-old blood of \"arrogant Americans.\" Indeed, columnist Mark Whittington observes, \"One should remind Mr. Obama and the Europeans how America has 'shown arrogance' by saving Europe from itself innumerable times in the 20th Century. World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the wars in the Balkans were largely resolved by American blood, treasure, and leadership.\" But all that appears lost on the president's seemingly insatiable quest to mend fences he imagines have been tarnished by the bullish George W. Bush. If Obama wishes to continue trampling the presidential tradition of showing class to former office holders and publicly trash Bush for his own personal gain, so be it. But all Americans should make clear that no man \u2013 even if he is the president \u2013 will tarnish the legacy of those Americans who have gone before us. Ours is not a history of arrogance. It is a history of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. When abusive monarchs repressed the masses, Americans resisted and overthrew them. When misguided policies led to the unjust oppression of fellow citizens, Americans rebelled and overturned them. When millions of impoverished and destitute wretches sought a new beginning, Americans threw open the door and welcomed them. When imperial dictators were on the march, Americans surrendered their lives to stop them. When communist thugs threatened world peace, Americans bled to defeat them. When an entire continent was overwhelmed with famine and hunger, Americans gave of themselves to sustain it. When terrorist madmen killed the innocent and subjugated millions, Americans led the fight to topple them. This is the legacy that generations of Americans have left. If President Obama seeks stronger relations with the world community, perhaps he should begin by reminding them of these very truths, rather than condemning his own countrymen on foreign shores. This \"obsessive need to put down his own country,\" has caused blogger James Lewis to call President Obama a \"stunningly ignorant man\" who has evidently never spoken to a concentration camp survivor, a Cuban refugee, a boat person from Vietnam, a Soviet dissident, or a survivor of Mao's purges. Unfortunately, I can no longer bring myself to give Mr. Obama that benefit of the doubt. Not after looking at the pain in my grandpa's eyes...a man who still carries shrapnel in his body from his service to this country. As a student and teacher of history, I recognize that America has made mistakes...plenty of them, in fact. But one of the great things about our people has been their courage and humility in admitting and correcting those mistakes. God willing, they will prove that willingness again in four years and correct the mistake that is the presidency of Barack Obama.",

It is a history of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. When abusive monarchs repressed the masses, Americans resisted and overthrew them. When misguided policies led to the unjust oppression of fellow citizens, Americans rebelled and overturned them. When millions of impoverished and destitute wretches sought a new beginning, Americans threw open the door and welcomed them. When imperial dictators were on the march, Americans surrendered their lives to stop them. When communist thugs threatened world peace, Americans bled to defeat them. When an entire continent was overwhelmed with famine and hunger, Americans gave of themselves to sustain it. When terrorist madmen killed the innocent and subjugated millions, Americans led the fight to topple them. This is the legacy that generations of Americans have left. If President Obama seeks stronger relations with the world community, perhaps he should begin by reminding them of these very truths, rather than condemning his own countrymen on foreign shores. This \"obsessive need to put down his own country,\" has caused blogger James Lewis to call President Obama a \"stunningly ignorant man\" who has evidently never spoken to a concentration camp survivor, a Cuban refugee, a boat person from Vietnam, a Soviet dissident, or a survivor of Mao's purges. Unfortunately, I can no longer bring myself to give Mr. Obama that benefit of the doubt. Not after looking at the pain in my grandpa's eyes...a man who still carries shrapnel in his body from his service to this country. As a student and teacher of history, I recognize that America has made mistakes...plenty of them, in fact. But one of the great things about our people has been their courage and humility in admitting and correcting those mistakes. God willing, they will prove that willingness again in four years and correct the mistake that is the presidency of Barack Obama.",

Peter Heck - Guest Columnist - 4/14/2009 7:50:00 AM As I was sitting in church waiting for the start of the service, my grandpa came walking towards me pointing his finger. No matter how old I get, and no matter how long he's been out of the U.S. Navy, that's still an intimidating sight. As he approached me, his voice quivered as he said, \"We saved that continent twice...how dare my president apologize for this country's arrogance.\" My grandpa is right. Americans need not apologize to the world for their arrogance; rather, Americans should apologize to their forefathers for the arrogance of their president. Barack Obama's first foreign trip as President of the United States has confirmed the naivet\u00e9 so many of us feared during the election cycle. But worse than that, it has also demonstrated that our president suffers from either a complete misunderstanding of our heritage and history, or an utter contempt for it. Neither is excusable. Garnering cheers from the French of all people, President Obama declared, \"In America, there is a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.\" Consider that Obama spoke these words just 500 miles from the beaches of Normandy, where the sand is still stained with 65-year-old blood of \"arrogant Americans.\" Indeed, columnist Mark Whittington observes, \"One should remind Mr. Obama and the Europeans how America has 'shown arrogance' by saving Europe from itself innumerable times in the 20th Century. World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the wars in the Balkans were largely resolved by American blood, treasure, and leadership.\" But all that appears lost on the president's seemingly insatiable quest to mend fences he imagines have been tarnished by the bullish George W.

        "content": "Well Scott, since you brought up the war situation, here are a few things. First and foremost, I did oppose the Iraq war and I was all for going into A-stan, getting rid of the Taliban and finding OBL. But, that was 8 years ago. Obama said that he was going to begin withdrawing \"most\" troops out of Iraq by August 2010. But, about 50,000 will remain until December 31, 2011. Now, that December 2011 date was actually set by Bush and the Iraqi government, so that one cannot be attributed to my Obama. But, the fact remains that there will still be troops there. And, that will always leave the door open for things to escalate again and I think that will probably happen. Let us not forget that Obama is also sending thousands of troops to A-stan to deal with the Taliban. The only reason we were after the Taliban in the first place was that they were aiding OBL. So, we wanted to get to him through them. But, he went off to P-stan and will probably never be captured. But, the fact remains, the only reason we went to A-stan was to get OBL. He isn't there anymore and the Taliban isn't (and, never was) a threat to us. So, what are we going back to A-stan for this time 8 years later? And, then there is Pakistan. We have been bombing the western border of P-stan ever since Obama took office. What is going on with that? Why are we bombing them? What is our goal in doing so? You like to talk about Bush. OK, that is fine. I never liked the guy, I never voted for him and I think that he was a terrible President. But, Obama is continuing the Bush policies that most everybody despised. Not just the war thing. But, Obama is also spending like an idiot. He is truly making Bush look like a penny-pinching miser is comparison. Also, Obama helped to reinstate the Patriot Act and the warrantless wiretaps. Let's not forget Gitmo. In Obama's Executive Order he said that Gitmo would be shut down within a year. But, he never said a damn thing about rendition. So, that begs the question, why aren't they shutting down Bagram? I will tell you why. Because, that is going to be the same thing as Gitmo, but without the stigma that the name \"Gitmo\" has. So, the detention and torture of the prisoners will continue. Just not in Gitmo. Now, the torture thing. It will still happen, just not by the same players. And, there will be absolutely no prosecution of anybody that has used or designed the guidelines used. This is easily concluded by the fact that he is leaving it up to the Office of the Attorney General to make the call. Hmm, let me see. Who was it that did the fancy bookwork to draft these torture memos? Oh, that's right. The Office of the Attorney General. Sure, the people in the office have changed, but they are not going to eat their own. That is for sure. So, all Obama did by delegating the power of prosecution is basically say that \"we are not going to prosecute anybody\". The same thing that he said a few days before he said that he was going to refer it to Holder. Dude, Obama is not changing a damn thing. He is following the policies of the Bush regime to a T. He is just being a little smarter about it. Which would make sense, because Bush was a dolt.",

You know, every time I see any kind of poll data I often wonder what the percentage of Americans are completely oblivious to what in the hell is going on. Some good examples are the polls asking whether Iraq had WMDs and if there was an AQ link. Another example is when Razmussen asked Obama supporters questions regarding facts about Obama and facts about McCain. Needless to say, the Obama supporters looked like idiots. Looking back on the posts that I have made criticizing Bush, I am seeing the same trend with Obama. He is not very different than Bush other than he is smarter about the way he does things. He doesn't do things with the arrogance that Bush did. He does listen and he does give the impression that he is taking what people say into account. But, when they program you well enough, then all he has to do is listen to what they wanted you to believe.

Peter Heck - Guest Columnist - 4/14/2009 7:50:00 AM As I was sitting in church waiting for the start of the service, my grandpa came walking towards me pointing his finger. No matter how old I get, and no matter how long he's been out of the U.S. Navy, that's still an intimidating sight. As he approached me, his voice quivered as he said, \"We saved that continent twice...how dare my president apologize for this country's arrogance.\" My grandpa is right. Americans need not apologize to the world for their arrogance; rather, Americans should apologize to their forefathers for the arrogance of their president. Barack Obama's first foreign trip as President of the United States has confirmed the naivet\u00e9 so many of us feared during the election cycle. But worse than that, it has also demonstrated that our president suffers from either a complete misunderstanding of our heritage and history, or an utter contempt for it. Neither is excusable. Garnering cheers from the French of all people, President Obama declared, \"In America, there is a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.\" Consider that Obama spoke these words just 500 miles from the beaches of Normandy, where the sand is still stained with 65-year-old blood of \"arrogant Americans.\" Indeed, columnist Mark Whittington observes, \"One should remind Mr. Obama and the Europeans how America has 'shown arrogance' by saving Europe from itself innumerable times in the 20th Century. World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the wars in the Balkans were largely resolved by American blood, treasure, and leadership.\" But all that appears lost on the president's seemingly insatiable quest to mend fences he imagines have been tarnished by the bullish George W. Bush. If Obama wishes to continue trampling the presidential tradition of showing class to former office holders and publicly trash Bush for his own personal gain, so be it. But all Americans should make clear that no man \u2013 even if he is the president \u2013 will tarnish the legacy of those Americans who have gone before us. Ours is not a history of arrogance. It is a history of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. When abusive monarchs repressed the masses, Americans resisted and overthrew them. When misguided policies led to the unjust oppression of fellow citizens, Americans rebelled and overturned them. When millions of impoverished and destitute wretches sought a new beginning, Americans threw open the door and welcomed them. When imperial dictators were on the march, Americans surrendered their lives to stop them. When communist thugs threatened world peace, Americans bled to defeat them. When an entire continent was overwhelmed with famine and hunger, Americans gave of themselves to sustain it. When terrorist madmen killed the innocent and subjugated millions, Americans led the fight to topple them. This is the legacy that generations of Americans have left. If President Obama seeks stronger relations with the world community, perhaps he should begin by reminding them of these very truths, rather than condemning his own countrymen on foreign shores. This \"obsessive need to put down his own country,\" has caused blogger James Lewis to call President Obama a \"stunningly ignorant man\" who has evidently never spoken to a concentration camp survivor, a Cuban refugee, a boat person from Vietnam, a Soviet dissident, or a survivor of Mao's purges. Unfortunately, I can no longer bring myself to give Mr. Obama that benefit of the doubt. Not after looking at the pain in my grandpa's eyes...a man who still carries shrapnel in his body from his service to this country. As a student and teacher of history, I recognize that America has made mistakes...plenty of them, in fact. But one of the great things about our people has been their courage and humility in admitting and correcting those mistakes. God willing, they will prove that willingness again in four years and correct the mistake that is the presidency of Barack Obama. Yes American administrations, right from the start, have made mistakes BUT thanks to the US most of the world speak the language of their choosing, not German or Japanese and there are several million people in Iraq who can now vote, go to school, go to work, get medical care for the first time in 50+ years. Barry the kowtowing apologist needs should have spent more time learning what being an American is all about rather than what \"being black in America\" was all about.",

First, it's not a \"good thing\" to borrow and spend money for anything, including a war. When George W. Bush cut 1.6 trillion dollars in taxes and began a costly Iraq War without any support from our major allies, he did exactly what you are bashing Obama for. Passing the buck onto our grandchildren with credit card debt. Everyone paid for the first Gulf War. This time our leaders wanted to be macho men and turned their back on \"old Europe\", while eating freedom fries. Now, the cost of war is on the American taxpayer. You do not cut a record 1.6 trillion dollars in taxes, run up record deficits, hide the cost of war in our government budgets, hand out no bid contracts, and consider yourself a \"fiscal conservative\". Secondly, Obama did not \"prop up banks and businesses\". It was George W. Bush that signed the 700 billion dollar bailout of the mortgage companies last fall, months before Obama was elected President. President Obama inherited all of this.

First, it's not a \"good thing\" to borrow and spend money for anything, including a war. When George W. Bush cut 1.6 trillion dollars in taxes and began a costly Iraq War without any support from our major allies, he did exactly what you are bashing Obama for. Passing the buck onto our grandchildren with credit card debt. Everyone paid for the first Gulf War. This time our leaders wanted to be macho men and turned their back on \"old Europe\", while eating freedom fries. Now, the cost of war is on the American taxpayer. You do not cut a record 1.6 trillion dollars in taxes, run up record deficits, hide the cost of war in our government budgets, hand out no bid contracts, and consider yourself a \"fiscal conservative\". Secondly, Obama did not \"prop up banks and businesses\". It was George W. Bush that signed the 700 billion dollar bailout of the mortgage companies last fall, months before Obama was elected President. President Obama inherited all of this. Finally, I'd say funding for infrastructure is a tangible investment, so much more so than the derivative fake economic growth all throughout the Bush years that finally imploded in our faces fall of last year.",
