I actually missed your sorry, liberal azz. *hugs* I have a compunction for DIY things. There's nothing on my house I cannot fix myself, but I mean DIY like home brewing, canning, reloading ammunition -- they call it \"rolling your own\" -- and gardening. I do some canning, but my mom was a PRO at it, God bless her memory. I still have one, single jar of homemade Kimchee left, and I am trying to stretch it. Never have tried reloading or brewing, though. So, does anyone have any suggestions on the cheapest way to get into home brewing? Kind of a kit that has everything you need in one package to get started? I'm sure I could just Google it, and I will, but nothing beats first-hand experience. When my lady gets here to Texas, I plan on getting a place that has at least some room for a decent garden, where I want to raise vegetables and spices. I have heard time and time again that gardening is THE best stress reliever. And I will be getting into reloading, mostly because I want to, but also because I think the government is going to limit ammunition to the point that I'll one day only be able to shoot what I make. Next to my reloading benches, ironically enough, will be my brewery; I want to start with one or two flavors, but eventually I want to experiment and find THE beer that is right for me. So what are some suggestions? Are there rookie mistakes you can help me avoid? Equipment recommendations? I know this thread is about recipes, but I hope you don't mind me asking the questions here. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

So what are some suggestions? Are there rookie mistakes you can help me avoid? Equipment recommendations? I can tell you about SOME rookie mistakes that apply across the board, regardless of what you're brewing. Make sure that you REALLY sterilize your equipment (I've heard horror stories). Also, when you're sampling the brew too early, and there's still a chance it has live yeast, SPIT IT OUT. Even if it's starting to taste really good, even if you think, \"Oh, it's just a little bit,\" don't drink it. You will be sicker than you've ever been before. Not my first-hand experience, but I've witnessed the aftermath of someone who said, \"Oh, it's just a little bit!\" If you've added fruit or coffee grounds to your brew for flavor, be warned that the foaming action of yeastie-beasties can cause the tiny seeds or grounds to be pushed up out of the carboy and into the vent system and clog it up and the pressure will build up and... KA-BOOM. quote: I know this thread is about recipes, but I hope you don't mind me asking the questions here. Not just about recipes, but any home-brewing talk you want.
