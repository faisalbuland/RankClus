If you do take the time to read the article, pay close attention to the comments at the end. It should be noted that, as LTC Fehrenbach mentions in the article, nobody knew about his orientation except for a select few in his chain of command, a couple of investigators and some lawyers. It has not yet been released how they came to know he is gay. I look forward to hearing about that particular detail.",

If you read the article (or hell, watch the video if reading is too hard for you) you'll note that the \"10 people\" he spoke of are all directly involved in the discharge proceedings.

He deserves our respect, not our ridicule. You people are sickening. Here's the timeline. In May, allegations from some unnamed, unknown source (that the Air Force will not disclose) told the Air Force that this decorated combat leader may be gay. The chain of command initiated an investigation, and told him is September that he faced an administrative discharge board. Only now, a year later, is he publicly outing himself for the first time ever. Try as you might, you cannot pretend the man is being selfish. He is merely pointing out the truth - it is impossible for the Air Force to make the claim that his presence harmed good order and discipline if no one her served with knew he was gay. The US Court of Appeals, in the similar case of Major Witt, agrees. I hope he wins his appeal as well.",

It should be noted that, as LTC Fehrenbach mentions in the article, nobody knew about his orientation except for a select few in his chain of command, a couple of investigators and some lawyers. It has not yet been released how they came to know he is gay. I look forward to hearing about that particular detail.",

If you read the article (or hell, watch the video if reading is too hard for you) you'll note that the \"10 people\" he spoke of are all directly involved in the discharge proceedings. In other words, he did not come to them, they came to him. That's a big difference when you're trying to vilify someone just because you think it's icky when boys kiss boys. You're trying to make this man out to be a malicious force, when in reality he is a decorated combat leader who saved many lives in the opening days of Iraq. He deserves our respect, not our ridicule. You people are sickening. Here's the timeline. In May, allegations from some unnamed, unknown source (that the Air Force will not disclose) told the Air Force that this decorated combat leader may be gay. The chain of command initiated an investigation, and told him is September that he faced an administrative discharge board.

You're trying to make this man out to be a malicious force, when in reality he is a decorated combat leader who saved many lives in the opening days of Iraq. He deserves our respect, not our ridicule. You people are sickening. Here's the timeline.

If you read the article (or hell, watch the video if reading is too hard for you) you'll note that the \"10 people\" he spoke of are all directly involved in the discharge proceedings. In other words, he did not come to them, they came to him. That's a big difference when you're trying to vilify someone just because you think it's icky when boys kiss boys. You're trying to make this man out to be a malicious force, when in reality he is a decorated combat leader who saved many lives in the opening days of Iraq. He deserves our respect, not our ridicule. You people are sickening. Here's the timeline. In May, allegations from some unnamed, unknown source (that the Air Force will not disclose) told the Air Force that this decorated combat leader may be gay. The chain of command initiated an investigation, and told him is September that he faced an administrative discharge board. Only now, a year later, is he publicly outing himself for the first time ever. Try as you might, you cannot pretend the man is being selfish. He is merely pointing out the truth - it is impossible for the Air Force to make the claim that his presence harmed good order and discipline if no one her served with knew he was gay. The US Court of Appeals, in the similar case of Major Witt, agrees. I hope he wins his appeal as well.",

        "reply": " If you read the article (or hell, watch the video if reading is too hard for you) you'll note that the \"10 people\" he spoke of are all directly involved in the discharge proceedings. In other words, he did not come to them, they came to him. That's a big difference when you're trying to vilify someone just because you think it's icky when boys kiss boys. You're trying to make this man out to be a malicious force, when in reality he is a decorated combat leader who saved many lives in the opening days of Iraq. He deserves our respect, not our ridicule. You people are sickening. Here's the timeline. In May, allegations from some unnamed, unknown source (that the Air Force will not disclose) told the Air Force that this decorated combat leader may be gay. The chain of command initiated an investigation, and told him is September that he faced an administrative discharge board. Only now, a year later, is he publicly outing himself for the first time ever. Try as you might, you cannot pretend the man is being selfish. He is merely pointing out the truth - it is impossible for the Air Force to make the claim that his presence harmed good order and discipline if no one her served with knew he was gay. The US Court of Appeals, in the similar case of Major Witt, agrees. I hope he wins his appeal as well.",

You're trying to make this man out to be a malicious force, when in reality he is a decorated combat leader who saved many lives in the opening days of Iraq. He deserves our respect, not our ridicule. You people are sickening. Here's the timeline. In May, allegations from some unnamed, unknown source (that the Air Force will not disclose) told the Air Force that this decorated combat leader may be gay. The chain of command initiated an investigation, and told him is September that he faced an administrative discharge board. Only now, a year later, is he publicly outing himself for the first time ever. Try as you might, you cannot pretend the man is being selfish. He is merely pointing out the truth - it is impossible for the Air Force to make the claim that his presence harmed good order and discipline if no one her served with knew he was gay. The US Court of Appeals, in the similar case of Major Witt, agrees. I hope he wins his appeal as well.",

In other words, he did not come to them, they came to him. That's a big difference when you're trying to vilify someone just because you think it's icky when boys kiss boys. You're trying to make this man out to be a malicious force, when in reality he is a decorated combat leader who saved many lives in the opening days of Iraq. He deserves our respect, not our ridicule. You people are sickening. Here's the timeline. In May, allegations from some unnamed, unknown source (that the Air Force will not disclose) told the Air Force that this decorated combat leader may be gay. The chain of command initiated an investigation, and told him is September that he faced an administrative discharge board. Only now, a year later, is he publicly outing himself for the first time ever. Try as you might, you cannot pretend the man is being selfish. He is merely pointing out the truth - it is impossible for the Air Force to make the claim that his presence harmed good order and discipline if no one her served with knew he was gay. The US Court of Appeals, in the similar case of Major Witt, agrees. I hope he wins his appeal as well.",

Only now, a year later, is he publicly outing himself for the first time ever. Try as you might, you cannot pretend the man is being selfish. He is merely pointing out the truth - it is impossible for the Air Force to make the claim that his presence harmed good order and discipline if no one her served with knew he was gay.
