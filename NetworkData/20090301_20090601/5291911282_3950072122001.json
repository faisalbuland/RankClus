We invited close friends and neighbors. This was last May, great weather, etc. Anyway, 3 of our neighbors came in 1 pickup, Karen Woody and Mike. Well when Mike got out of the truck, or should I say stumbled, he ran right into our house. I said to him, damn Mike drunk already??? He was so drunk he embarassed me and my family. We had people in their 80's here along with my dad and Dennis parents. K, later in the same year, we get an invite to Karens 50th BD. That was fine, but we had to go to Mikes house to celebrate it. And then, this past weekend we get an invite to Mike's 55th birthday. Dennis didn't really want to go, but I wanted to. I tried to overlook Mike, (drunk). We went out to eat at a nice little place here in town. As the night goes on we chat. Later on the subject of weight comes up. Toni, which is Karen and Woodys daughter was there. Mike told Toni that she looked a lot better since she has gained some weight. Mike told her to stand up and turn around so he could see her butt. Toni is 28 years old. I could not believe that he said that to her, considering he is old enough to be her father. And plus with her mom and dad sitting right there next to him. Mike, Karen and Woody are real close........ When we got home I asked Dennis how he would feel if one of his friends told his daughter that she had a nice butt. Dennis reply was, \"I don't have friends like that\". Ok, just venting.........",

We invited close friends and neighbors. This was last May, great weather, etc. Anyway, 3 of our neighbors came in 1 pickup, Karen Woody and Mike. Well when Mike got out of the truck, or should I say stumbled, he ran right into our house. I said to him, damn Mike drunk already??? He was so drunk he embarassed me and my family. We had people in their 80's here along with my dad and Dennis parents. K, later in the same year, we get an invite to Karens 50th BD. That was fine, but we had to go to Mikes house to celebrate it. And then, this past weekend we get an invite to Mike's 55th birthday. Dennis didn't really want to go, but I wanted to. I tried to overlook Mike, (drunk). We went out to eat at a nice little place here in town. As the night goes on we chat. Later on the subject of weight comes up. Toni, which is Karen and Woodys daughter was there. Mike told Toni that she looked a lot better since she has gained some weight. Mike told her to stand up and turn around so he could see her butt. Toni is 28 years old. I could not believe that he said that to her, considering he is old enough to be her father. And plus with her mom and dad sitting right there next to him. Mike, Karen and Woody are real close........ When we got home I asked Dennis how he would feel if one of his friends told his daughter that she had a nice butt. Dennis reply was, \"I don't have friends like that\". Ok, just venting.........",
