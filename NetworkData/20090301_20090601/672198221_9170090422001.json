Chen fell 26 feet (8 meters) onto a partially inflated emergency air cushion laid out by authorities and survived, suffering spine and elbow injuries, the official Xinhua News Agency said Saturday. The passer-by, 66-year-old Lai Jiansheng, had been fed up with what he called Chen's \"selfish activity,\" Xinhua said. Traffic around the Haizhu bridge in the city of Guangzhou had been backed up for five hours and police had cordoned off the area. \"I pushed him off because jumpers like Chen are very selfish. Their action violates a lot of public interest,\" Lai was quoted as saying by Xinhua. \"They do not really dare to kill themselves.
