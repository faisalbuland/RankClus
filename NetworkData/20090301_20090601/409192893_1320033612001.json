We went from placation and nailbiting over SALT treaties and mutually assured destruction to taking charge of our situation and arms racing the Soviets Union out of existence. I served under every President from Reagan to GW Bush. And the average active duty GI didn't care one way or the other who the Commander in Chief was. In fact, in my experience, most GIs do not only not declare themselves members of a political party, but they didn't care about politics one way or another. So, among the circle of GIs you associated yourself with, who were probably like-minded people (as most of our friends are), there may have been a certain sentiment one way or the other, but don't make the mistake of assuming that all GIs, or even a majority of GIs, are on a given side of a political fence. I submit to you that they are not. The average 17- or 18-year old doesn't join the military out of any particular patriotic or political attitude, and while the patriotic piece often changes as they spend more time in, the political does not. \"Star Wars\", or the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) - went nowhere. Spent a lot of money, though. The B-1: Well, it took an awful long time before it was ever used. For the most part, it's been a hangar queen, much like it's other supersonic predecessor, the B-58 Hustler. That's been pretty expensive, too. Carter cancelled the project because it wasn't cost effective, and we could develop ALCMs (Air Launched Cruise Missiles) that could do the job for a lot less money. In fact, the Air Force retired over 30 of them to offset the costs of maintaing the entire fleet, the brought back seven, and started using canned birds from the remainder. Good project?

        "content": "Reagan Turned the Military\u2019s Morale By David DeBatto President Ronald W Reagan was the 40th President of the United States and our Commander-in-Chief during the bulk of the 1980s, taking over at a time when the nation, the U.S. military included, did not feel particularly good about itself. We had just endured 440-some odd days of the Iranian hostage crisis during which the country was humbled for over a year by some radical students and a recently returned-from-exile cleric. The mood of the people was foul. We were frustrated, and especially within the military, we were angry. There was a feeling of helplessness that was new to Americans. President Jimmy Carter had seemed paralyzed by the crisis. The more he negotiated with the Iranians, the worse the situation seemed to get. When he finally did make a move, it was an ill-fated rescue mission led by some of the original Delta Force teams that met with disaster in the desert outside of Tehran. That was arguably the low point of the entire decade for America. I can still remember, as a private 1st class on my way to a tour in Germany, the shock, anger and finally sadness upon hearing of the mission\u2019s fate. It didn\u2019t get any worse than that. Then, on Jan. 20, 1981, Reagan was inaugurated and the whole world changed, at least for those of us in uniform, and I suspect, for a great many other Americans as well. Literally as president-elect Reagan was sitting near the podium waiting to be sworn in, aides whispered to him that the hostages had been released. He made that announcement from the podium and the nation\u2019s mood went from dark to light almost immediately. Now, what did that all mean to the grunt? Well, for one thing, it meant that we could start to feel proud of ourselves, our uniform, our military, and yes, our president again. Not that we didn\u2019t respect Jimmy Carter, but he had presided over a presidency that had seen our nation\u2019s and our military\u2019s image and self-esteem, sink to a new low. Think Abu Ghraib and you have some idea of how it was, only worse. That did an about-face with the inauguration of Ronald Reagan. It was a breath of fresh, cordite-filled air. Sure, President Carter had been a naval officer and Reagan only a movie star soldier, but Reagan got it. He understood the men and women in uniform and we knew it. He told us it was a new day for the United States and he did something about it. When he took office, the Army (my frame of reference) was a disaster. It still consisted of malcontent holdovers from Vietnam, both enlisted and officer, and bottom-of-the-barrel newbies who could not make it in the civilian world. The whole volunteer Army thing was brand new and it showed. The uniforms, equipment, barracks, weapons, chow and every other component of Army life were, to put it mildly, lacking. To add insult to injury, we were also getting vastly underpaid for all of our misery. As one might imagine, morale was in the mud. President Reagan hit the ground running. He rammed through a series of pay raises that did not exactly bring the military into parity with the civilian sector, but was a dramatic increase from the Vietnam-era salary levels they had been at. That was a huge shot in the arm all by itself. He also initiated a major rehabilitation of military housing, especially at OCONUS posts, that greatly improved life for soldiers and their families. During the 1980s, the Army saw some major new weapons platforms fielded, such as the M1 Abrams main battle tank and the Apache attack helicopter. The BDU, now, common throughout the U.S military, was introduced during his watch to replace the bland, boring olive-drab fatigues and baseball cap that had been worn since the 1950s. The warrior image had been reborn. Increased funding for field training exercises and professional non-commissioned officer development was made available. NCOES was formalized and directly linked to promotions. The NCO corps was professionalized as never before. High standards were set and expected. The bar had been raised. A fast and deliberate pace had been set and that pace continued during his entire two terms in office. President Reagan also did the military proud by staring down our old adversary, the Soviet Union, and telling them in no uncertain terms that the USA was back and we would be kickin\u2019 ass and takin\u2019 names! That got everyone\u2019s attention and provided us grunts with plenty of motivation to get the job done. It sure felt good to have a commander-in-chief who spoke our language for a change. Did President Reagan run up the national debt? Sure. Was there an end run regarding the Iran-Contra affair? Maybe. Was the decision to cut and run after Beirut a mistake? Probably. But for my money and that of most soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines I know, it was an honor and privilege to have served under President Ronald Reagan. Drive on sir!",

I served under every President from Reagan to GW Bush. And the average active duty GI didn't care one way or the other who the Commander in Chief was. In fact, in my experience, most GIs do not only not declare themselves members of a political party, but they didn't care about politics one way or another. So, among the circle of GIs you associated yourself with, who were probably like-minded people (as most of our friends are), there may have been a certain sentiment one way or the other, but don't make the mistake of assuming that all GIs, or even a majority of GIs, are on a given side of a political fence. I submit to you that they are not. The average 17- or 18-year old doesn't join the military out of any particular patriotic or political attitude, and while the patriotic piece often changes as they spend more time in, the political does not. \"Star Wars\", or the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) - went nowhere. Spent a lot of money, though. The B-1: Well, it took an awful long time before it was ever used. For the most part, it's been a hangar queen, much like it's other supersonic predecessor, the B-58 Hustler. That's been pretty expensive, too. Carter cancelled the project because it wasn't cost effective, and we could develop ALCMs (Air Launched Cruise Missiles) that could do the job for a lot less money. In fact, the Air Force retired over 30 of them to offset the costs of maintaing the entire fleet, the brought back seven, and started using canned birds from the remainder. Good project?

        "content": "Reagan Turned the Military\u2019s Morale By David DeBatto President Ronald W Reagan was the 40th President of the United States and our Commander-in-Chief during the bulk of the 1980s, taking over at a time when the nation, the U.S. military included, did not feel particularly good about itself. We had just endured 440-some odd days of the Iranian hostage crisis during which the country was humbled for over a year by some radical students and a recently returned-from-exile cleric. The mood of the people was foul. We were frustrated, and especially within the military, we were angry. There was a feeling of helplessness that was new to Americans. President Jimmy Carter had seemed paralyzed by the crisis. The more he negotiated with the Iranians, the worse the situation seemed to get. When he finally did make a move, it was an ill-fated rescue mission led by some of the original Delta Force teams that met with disaster in the desert outside of Tehran. That was arguably the low point of the entire decade for America. I can still remember, as a private 1st class on my way to a tour in Germany, the shock, anger and finally sadness upon hearing of the mission\u2019s fate. It didn\u2019t get any worse than that. Then, on Jan. 20, 1981, Reagan was inaugurated and the whole world changed, at least for those of us in uniform, and I suspect, for a great many other Americans as well. Literally as president-elect Reagan was sitting near the podium waiting to be sworn in, aides whispered to him that the hostages had been released. He made that announcement from the podium and the nation\u2019s mood went from dark to light almost immediately. Now, what did that all mean to the grunt? Well, for one thing, it meant that we could start to feel proud of ourselves, our uniform, our military, and yes, our president again. Not that we didn\u2019t respect Jimmy Carter, but he had presided over a presidency that had seen our nation\u2019s and our military\u2019s image and self-esteem, sink to a new low. Think Abu Ghraib and you have some idea of how it was, only worse. That did an about-face with the inauguration of Ronald Reagan. It was a breath of fresh, cordite-filled air. Sure, President Carter had been a naval officer and Reagan only a movie star soldier, but Reagan got it. He understood the men and women in uniform and we knew it. He told us it was a new day for the United States and he did something about it. When he took office, the Army (my frame of reference) was a disaster. It still consisted of malcontent holdovers from Vietnam, both enlisted and officer, and bottom-of-the-barrel newbies who could not make it in the civilian world. The whole volunteer Army thing was brand new and it showed. The uniforms, equipment, barracks, weapons, chow and every other component of Army life were, to put it mildly, lacking. To add insult to injury, we were also getting vastly underpaid for all of our misery. As one might imagine, morale was in the mud. President Reagan hit the ground running. He rammed through a series of pay raises that did not exactly bring the military into parity with the civilian sector, but was a dramatic increase from the Vietnam-era salary levels they had been at. That was a huge shot in the arm all by itself. He also initiated a major rehabilitation of military housing, especially at OCONUS posts, that greatly improved life for soldiers and their families. During the 1980s, the Army saw some major new weapons platforms fielded, such as the M1 Abrams main battle tank and the Apache attack helicopter. The BDU, now, common throughout the U.S military, was introduced during his watch to replace the bland, boring olive-drab fatigues and baseball cap that had been worn since the 1950s. The warrior image had been reborn. Increased funding for field training exercises and professional non-commissioned officer development was made available. NCOES was formalized and directly linked to promotions. The NCO corps was professionalized as never before. High standards were set and expected. The bar had been raised. A fast and deliberate pace had been set and that pace continued during his entire two terms in office. President Reagan also did the military proud by staring down our old adversary, the Soviet Union, and telling them in no uncertain terms that the USA was back and we would be kickin\u2019 ass and takin\u2019 names! That got everyone\u2019s attention and provided us grunts with plenty of motivation to get the job done. It sure felt good to have a commander-in-chief who spoke our language for a change. Did President Reagan run up the national debt? Sure. Was there an end run regarding the Iran-Contra affair? Maybe. Was the decision to cut and run after Beirut a mistake? Probably. But for my money and that of most soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines I know, it was an honor and privilege to have served under President Ronald Reagan. Drive on sir!",
