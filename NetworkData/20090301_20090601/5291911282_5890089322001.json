There are rules and regulations that all courts have to follow when serving active duty members of the military that protect said active duty member from not being able to appear in court because of deployment. So yes, you will have to wait until he gets back from his deployment to go to court, a default judgement cannot be placed against him while he is deployed. That is just how it works and the fact that at 1 1/2 years you haven't just cut your losses and moved on worries me that you only see him as a paycheck at this point. Please remember what you are putting your children through at this point of forcing someone into their life that doesn't want to be there.",

        "content": "Mfamily2004- I started this in Nov of 07. There were complications because of my marital status and haveing CSE instead of a real attorney. There were solutions to the problem if I'd had a real attorney, but this was not the case, so the point is moot. The issue here is not whether or not I will be awarded support and back support. The issue is that he's only in the \"Reserves.\" He has known he had kids. He joined without disclosing it, and when we NEEDED him to provide for us a year ago, he COULD HAVE while he was at AIT and Boot Camp. But to protect his 'bonus' from being gonoshiered for the BACK child support, he wouldn't just sign their birth certificates and SUPPORT THEM. And he is only in the reserves. Once his tour in Iraq is over, full time pay and dependent pay stop, he will only get his 'weekend' pay and he'll work off the books. So I'll have a judgment for two and a half years of back child support. It's a worthless piece of paper. Proper procedure went out the window the day he lied about having kids. And FYI, I could afford my kids when I had them. He pushed to have a family (and he was NOT a soldier at the time and gave me NO indication that he would EVER become one), AND HE HAD THEM TOO. Not a case of I trapped him. He wanted them, but then he wanted out, still claiming he wants to be in their lives, but using every dirty little deadbeat dad trick to get away with supporting them. I would have never even had kids if he hadn't wanted them. So please, don't tell me that I 'need to take care of them.' I'm HERE... I AM taking care of them. I'm not the one who walked. But taking care of them isn't something I just 'HAVE TO DO' and he DOESN'T. How would you expect anyone to make him take care of his kids if I passively sit by 'taking care of his responsibilities' and don't pursue and push to get done what should have been done a year ago? And good for your mom for doing it on her own. That only bred a generation of women who let men off the hook, and a generation of deadbeat dads. Women who aren't fighting to HOLD MEN ACCOUNTABLE for their kids, are why it's so easy for our country to have a 50% divorce rate.

It's a huge difference in the lives of the kids, and that's just the financials. The emotional cost is even greater.

        "reply": "Mfamily2004- I started this in Nov of 07. There were complications because of my marital status and haveing CSE instead of a real attorney. There were solutions to the problem if I'd had a real attorney, but this was not the case, so the point is moot. The issue here is not whether or not I will be awarded support and back support. The issue is that he's only in the \"Reserves.\" He has known he had kids. He joined without disclosing it, and when we NEEDED him to provide for us a year ago, he COULD HAVE while he was at AIT and Boot Camp. But to protect his 'bonus' from being gonoshiered for the BACK child support, he wouldn't just sign their birth certificates and SUPPORT THEM. And he is only in the reserves. Once his tour in Iraq is over, full time pay and dependent pay stop, he will only get his 'weekend' pay and he'll work off the books. So I'll have a judgment for two and a half years of back child support. It's a worthless piece of paper. Proper procedure went out the window the day he lied about having kids. And FYI, I could afford my kids when I had them. He pushed to have a family (and he was NOT a soldier at the time and gave me NO indication that he would EVER become one), AND HE HAD THEM TOO. Not a case of I trapped him. He wanted them, but then he wanted out, still claiming he wants to be in their lives, but using every dirty little deadbeat dad trick to get away with supporting them. I would have never even had kids if he hadn't wanted them. So please, don't tell me that I 'need to take care of them.' I'm HERE... I AM taking care of them. I'm not the one who walked. But taking care of them isn't something I just 'HAVE TO DO' and he DOESN'T. How would you expect anyone to make him take care of his kids if I passively sit by 'taking care of his responsibilities' and don't pursue and push to get done what should have been done a year ago?

She went to the courts in her perty new uniform and had a restraining order taken out on me. That included the kids.

Turns out that my ex has been lying to everyone all along. Badge bunny. She has no friends, no family, no nothing but her job. Her oldest is 18, pregnant -- no idea who dad is -- and just ran away from jail. The middle one that I am close to is squared away, but the ex refuses her permission to speak to me. The boy, who is younger, has taken to peeking under the best friend's sheets after her husband leaves. We split 4 years ago. She still blames all this on me. This was after she had me ARRESTED for a crime I never committed. So don't sit here and lecture ME about men being protected. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening.

The issue is that he's only in the \"Reserves.\" He has known he had kids. He joined without disclosing it, and when we NEEDED him to provide for us a year ago, he COULD HAVE while he was at AIT and Boot Camp. But to protect his 'bonus' from being gonoshiered for the BACK child support, he wouldn't just sign their birth certificates and SUPPORT THEM. And he is only in the reserves. Once his tour in Iraq is over, full time pay and dependent pay stop, he will only get his 'weekend' pay and he'll work off the books. So I'll have a judgment for two and a half years of back child support. It's a worthless piece of paper. Proper procedure went out the window the day he lied about having kids. And FYI, I could afford my kids when I had them. He pushed to have a family (and he was NOT a soldier at the time and gave me NO indication that he would EVER become one), AND HE HAD THEM TOO.

How would you expect anyone to make him take care of his kids if I passively sit by 'taking care of his responsibilities' and don't pursue and push to get done what should have been done a year ago? And good for your mom for doing it on her own. That only bred a generation of women who let men off the hook, and a generation of deadbeat dads. Women who aren't fighting to HOLD MEN ACCOUNTABLE for their kids, are why it's so easy for our country to have a 50% divorce rate. Men can walk any time they want to because of people who think it's ok to tell the mother 'you had them.' Do you realize the difference of the $500.00 a month I would get in 'child support' and the $40,000 a year income lost when Daddy walked out? It's a huge difference in the lives of the kids, and that's just the financials. The emotional cost is even greater. The only way men are ever going to learn what it means to be MEN, FATHERS, and HUSBANDS... is when people stop saying \"oh, well, you're not getting child support.

The boy, who is younger, has taken to peeking under the best friend's sheets after her husband leaves. We split 4 years ago. She still blames all this on me.
