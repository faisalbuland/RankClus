        "content": "Grassroots Call to Action May 20, 2009 A group of about 20 LGBT activists released a set of equality principles on Wednesday that they hoped would prompt all LGBT people to get more involved in the struggle for their rights. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime alignment of the stars, and if we blow it now, it might be another 20 years before we have it again,\u201d New York activist Jon Winkleman said of having an LGBT-friendly president along with huge Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. \u201cFor myself, I\u2019ve been frustrated,\u201d he added. \u201cI think a lot of big organizations should be setting a higher standard.\u201d PRINCIPLES The following eight guiding principles underlie our call to action. In order to achieve full civil rights now, we avow: 1. Full civil rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals must be enacted now. Delay and excuses are no longer acceptable. \u2028 2. We will not leave any part of our community behind. \u2028 3. Separate is never equal. \u2028 4. Religious beliefs are not a basis upon which to affirm or deny civil rights. \u2028 5. The establishment and guardianship of full civil rights is a non-partisan issue. \u2028 6. Individual involvement and grassroots action are paramount to success and must be encouraged. \u2028 7. Success is measured by the civil rights we all achieve, not by words, access, or money raised. \u2028 8. Those who seek our support are expected to commit to these principles. FULL CIVIL RIGHTS GOALS Being united by common principles and engaging in united action, we will achieve the following goals: 1. DIGNITY AND EQUALITY. Every lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender person has inherent dignity and worth, and has the right to live free of discrimination and harassment. \u2028 2. FAMILY. Every LGBT person has the right to a family without legal barriers to immigration, civil marriage, or raising children. \u2028 3. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. Every LGBT person has the right to economic opportunity free from discrimination in employment, public housing, accommodation, public facilities, credit, and federally funded programs and activities. \u2028 4. EDUCATION. Every LGBT child and youth has the right to an education that is affirming, inclusive, and free from bullying. \u2028 5. NATIONAL SECURITY. Every LGBT person should have the opportunity to serve our country openly and equally in our military and foreign service. \u2028 6. CRIME. Every LGBT person should enjoy life protected against bias crimes. \u2028 7. HEALTH CARE. Every person should have access to affordable, high quality, and culturally competent health care without discrimination. CALL TO ACTION 1. We demand that government officials act now to achieve full civil rights without delay. 2. Our organizations and individuals need to develop a collaborative and revolutionary new organizing model that mobilizes millions of supporters through emerging Web and phone technologies. 3. All LGBT individuals must accept personal responsibility to do everything within their power for equality and should get involved in the movement by volunteering, giving, and being out. 4. We will hold elected officials and our organizations accountable for being transparent and achieving full civil rights by active participation when possible and active opposition when necessary. 5. Our allies need to be proactive in public support for full civil rights. 6. Every government measure that quantifies the U.S. citizenry must permit LGBT individuals to self-identify and be counted in every way citizens are counted. 7. We demand that the media present LGBT lives in fair, accurate, and objective ways that neither include nor give credence to unsubstantiated, discriminatory claims and opinions.
