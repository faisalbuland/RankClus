But the interview he did on Jan. 16, as Israeli forces waged war on Gaza's Hamas rulers, was horrifyingly different: Israeli tank shells had just killed three of his daughters, and he was phoning an Israeli journalist-friend, live on the air, to plead for help in evacuating the wounded, including another daughter and a niece. Four months later, far from voicing bitterness over his loss, Abuelaish is trying to turn his tragedy into hope, raising money for a scholarship fund for Gaza girls and an Israeli hospital, and preaching reconciliation. \"We need to open our eyes, our minds and to have big hearts, to smash the mental and physical barriers and borders, to build the broken trust,\" said the Harvard-trained son of a Gaza laborer, sitting in the apartment where 14-year-old Aya, 15-year-old Mayar and 21-year-old Bissan were killed two days before the war ended. At a time when U.S. President Barack Obama has begun a round of meetings with Middle East leaders on how to end the Middle East conflict, Abuelaish's story illuminates the reality at ground level. With Israelis and Palestinians increasingly separated by fences and fear, it has offered a rare example of suffering on one side drawing empathy from the other.

I am saying that we need a change in direction in order to accomplish peace. The direction we've been on for decades, has not worked has it? So, since I too want to see peace, and believe that will only be obtained through justice for all, and since I am an American, I want to see a change which could be led by America and American Principles to finally end the vicious cycle of injustice and extermination of the loosers. This particular Palestinian Doctor, is not the only Palestinian who wants peace. Actually they all do. These are just people, and rather than hating and fighting they just want justice and a chance to build their own lives in a healthy way, as everyone wants. You don't have to see these thoughts as in conflict with your views.. That would be inaccurate.",
