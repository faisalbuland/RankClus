Just what is it you fear so much that paralyzes you From even being curious? An event such as the 9/11 attack, Thousands being killed on American soil,3 wars, thousands more KIA, Thousands more WIA,a collapsed economy Trillions in debt,Lies to congress, constitutional violations, A seriously flawed investigation only after much insistance, absolutely no accountability. And now with Proffesionals in all fields of science and engineering exibiting proof of How these towers could not have collapsed in the manner widely accepted by the frightened sheeple, You have the balls to call those who think Moonbats? Well sonny boy this was not just some nightmare that mommy can make better by singing you back to sleep. It was real and thousands of Innocent Americans died that day and we dont know why yet. We need a real complete investigation with all the evidence examined this time. If only to prove these moonbats as you call them wrong and re-unite this nation. Wake TFU and smell the coffee.",
