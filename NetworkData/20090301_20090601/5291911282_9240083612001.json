Her father is a software engineer, his income is about $2 million per year. He own's several pieces of very expensive real estate. My wife thought, with my fathers money and her fathers that we would do quite well. We had signed prenupt agreements that we would share 50/50 in community property! I might be ugly, but I ain't dumb! Keep smiling, everyone will wonder what you've been up to!",
