The words are still there, in Title 18 of the U.S. Code: \u201cWhoever outside the United States commits or attempts to commit torture shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both, and if death results to any person from conduct prohibited by this subsection, shall be punished by death or imprisoned for any term of years or for life.\u201d But thanks in part to President Barack Obama, those words have all the relevance of an archaic law prohibiting pig-selling on Sunday. They mean nothing. Publicly, Obama claims America has changed course. On his first day in office, he signed an executive order halting \u201cenhanced interrogations.\u201d But that did not restore the rule of law; it weakened it further. If one executive order can ban torture, as Obama claims, then another such order can restore it, simple as that. And let\u2019s at least be honest \u2014 what we have done is torture, sanctioned at the highest levels of government and at least tacitly accepted if not explicitly endorsed by Congress, including leading Democrats. Let\u2019s at least have the moral courage to acknowledge that fact. In World War II, waterboarding was torture when Japanese soldiers inflicted it on Americans such as Lt. Chase Jay Nielsen, captured in the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. In a tactic that sounds all too familiar, the Japanese claimed the treatment was legal because Nielsen was a war criminal not entitled to protection as a prisoner of war. In later war-crime trials, that defense failed. To Lt. Col. William Harrison, it was torture when inflicted by North Korean Communists. \u201cThey used the water treatment. They would bend my head back, put a towel over my face and pour water over the towel. I could not breathe. This went on for hour after, day after day. It was freezing cold. When I would pass out, they would shake me and begin again. They would leave me tied to the chair with the water freezing on and around me.\u201d That is not \u201cfraternity hazing.\u201d It is torture. If it is torture when inflicted on Americans by others, it is torture when we Americans do it. We torture. In the eyes of the world and whatever God you might worship, we torture. That is difficult for many to accept because we are Americans and we are supposed to be different: Our strength is in our principles and commitment to values. But what did it take to make us throw all that away? Nineteen men armed with a plan and box cutters? That is Osama bin Laden\u2019s victory: He scared us into fleeing the high ground. \u201cAll these things vanished when the Mujahideen hit you, and you then implemented the methods of the same documented governments that you used to curse,\u201d bin Laden chortled in 2002. \u201c\u2026 What happens in Guantanamo is a historical embarrassment to America and its values, and it screams into your faces: \u2018You hypocrites, what is the value of your signature on any agreement or treaty?\u2019 \u201d As bin Laden understands, the biggest canard of all is that the strong are willing to torture, to do what is necessary, while the weak shy from it. It takes no toughness to order the torture of a creature who is helpless to defend himself, a creature over whom you have absolute control. To the contrary, you torture because you fear that helpless creature \u2014 you do so because your fear is greater than the principles of civilization you tell yourselves you are defending.

The Treaties against torture do NOT just apply between signatories and according to the US Constitutions ratified treaties ARE US LAW.", 
        "reply": " Using treaties and rule of law only for the sake of defining enhanced interrogations to your terms only is kind of stupid. Again, none of this is about bringing someone to court and sentencing them. This is about preventing someone from basically pulling the trigger and putting into action a terrorist plan that could result in many deaths. In this case, waterboarding and enhanced interrogations isn't nearly as severe as a sniper's bullet.",

There are only nine of the Raiders left alive now, of the original eighty... Of the four mentioned in the book, only one, Lt. Robert Hite, later Cpt. Hite, I believe... Chase Jay Nielsen and Jacob Daniel DeShaser, died about one month and two months ago respectively... I think you can get it in paperback also... Great book and if you can get Robert Hite to sign it, WOW!... These men are heroes to me, especially Lt. Ted W. Lawson and Sgt. Jacob DeShazer... I briefly got to talk to Jacob DeShazer by phone, even the sound of his voice conveyed a man of great conviction in his beliefs, all of them, truly great men... We have been blessed as a nation to have such great men as these... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 ADDED NOTE: If you can get them, there are several books on the \"Raid\", that you could read... One is \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" by Lt. Ted W. Lawson and Robert Considine, \"Doolittle Tokyo Raiders\" by Lt.Col. Carroll V. Glines, \"Guests of the Kremlin\" by Lt.[later Colonel] Robert Emmons and there are more but those are about the best... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 This message has been edited.

I and my son will be there. Maybe get a chance to at least stand in their presence. I am looking for the book now. A new one costs $106.00.", 
        "reply": " There are only nine of the Raiders left alive now, of the original eighty... Of the four mentioned in the book, only one, Lt. Robert Hite, later Cpt. Hite, I believe... Chase Jay Nielsen and Jacob Daniel DeShaser, died about one month and two months ago respectively... I think you can get it in paperback also... Great book and if you can get Robert Hite to sign it, WOW!... These men are heroes to me, especially Lt. Ted W. Lawson and Sgt. Jacob DeShazer... I briefly got to talk to Jacob DeShazer by phone, even the sound of his voice conveyed a man of great conviction in his beliefs, all of them, truly great men... We have been blessed as a nation to have such great men as these... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 ADDED NOTE: If you can get them, there are several books on the \"Raid\", that you could read... One is \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" by Lt. Ted W. Lawson and Robert Considine, \"Doolittle Tokyo Raiders\" by Lt.Col. Carroll V. Glines, \"Guests of the Kremlin\" by Lt.[later Colonel] Robert Emmons and there are more but those are about the best... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 This message has been edited.

They mean nothing. Publicly, Obama claims America has changed course.

Let\u2019s at least have the moral courage to acknowledge that fact. In World War II, waterboarding was torture when Japanese soldiers inflicted it on Americans such as Lt. Chase Jay Nielsen, captured in the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. In a tactic that sounds all too familiar, the Japanese claimed the treatment was legal because Nielsen was a war criminal not entitled to protection as a prisoner of war. In later war-crime trials, that defense failed. To Lt. Col. William Harrison, it was torture when inflicted by North Korean Communists. \u201cThey used the water treatment. They would bend my head back, put a towel over my face and pour water over the towel. I could not breathe. This went on for hour after, day after day. It was freezing cold. When I would pass out, they would shake me and begin again. They would leave me tied to the chair with the water freezing on and around me.\u201d That is not \u201cfraternity hazing.\u201d It is torture. If it is torture when inflicted on Americans by others, it is torture when we Americans do it. We torture. In the eyes of the world and whatever God you might worship, we torture. That is difficult for many to accept because we are Americans and we are supposed to be different: Our strength is in our principles and commitment to values. But what did it take to make us throw all that away? Nineteen men armed with a plan and box cutters?

It takes no toughness to order the torture of a creature who is helpless to defend himself, a creature over whom you have absolute control.

His first conquest was Abu Zubaydah. Found in Pakistan, shot three times during his capture, sent for medical treatment and then to a black hole in Thailand for interrogation\".",

There are only nine of the Raiders left alive now, of the original eighty... Of the four mentioned in the book, only one, Lt. Robert Hite, later Cpt. Hite, I believe... Chase Jay Nielsen and Jacob Daniel DeShaser, died about one month and two months ago respectively... I think you can get it in paperback also... Great book and if you can get Robert Hite to sign it, WOW!... These men are heroes to me, especially Lt. Ted W. Lawson and Sgt. Jacob DeShazer... I briefly got to talk to Jacob DeShazer by phone, even the sound of his voice conveyed a man of great conviction in his beliefs, all of them, truly great men... We have been blessed as a nation to have such great men as these... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 ADDED NOTE: If you can get them, there are several books on the \"Raid\", that you could read... One is \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" by Lt. Ted W. Lawson and Robert Considine, \"Doolittle Tokyo Raiders\" by Lt.Col. Carroll V.
