Recent Syrian contracts with Russia for future delivery include new MiG-31 and MiG-29M/M2 fighter aircraft.\u201d Appendix A: The Aircraft MiG-29OVT/ MiG-35 The MiG-31E is reportedly offered on a trade-in basis for countries that have the MiG-25 Foxbat interceptor, a list that currently includes only Syria, Libya, and Kazakhstan. The big MiG-25 caused quite a sensation in the west when it was first unveiled, and incidents in which the planes were tracked at speeds around Mach 3 added to its mystique. In time, the west would learn that its aerodynamic design and lack of a gun made it vulnerable in dogfights, that flying at speeds over Mach 2.5 had a tendency to melt the plane\u2019s engines, and that its range was extremely short... The MiG-31 made a virtue out of the Foxbat\u2019s vices, turning it into a 2-seat hunter-killer of cruise missiles via extra fuel, improved engines and intakes, in-flight refueling, the \u2018Flash Dance\u2019 electronically scanned radar, a retractable refueling probe, and an internal gun. Unlike its predecessor, the MiG-31 is capable of low-level supersonic flight, and can reach Mach 2.8 before its engines begin to melt. It also has communications capabilities that allow its pilot to view the full air battle in a C3I mini-AWACS role, and direct other aircraft like a chess player. Aeronautics.RU described the MiG-31E variant as: \u201cExport version of basic Type 01. Prototype (\u2018903\u2019) first noted 1997; simplified systems, no active jammer, downgraded IFF, radar and DASS. Offered to China, India and other countries.\u201d These planes could be of some use to Syria in an air defense role. Syria\u2019s air force, which was once reliably on the cutting edge of technology during its Cold War years as a Soviet proxy, has not modernized in over a decade. Iran\u2019s two air forces (regular and Revolutionary Guard) would find the MiG-31\u2019s style crimped by the absence of air-to-air refueling capabilities, but cruise missile defense is important to them given the likelihood of cruise being used in enemy strikes from Israel or America. MiG-31s could also step into the \u2018fighter AWACS\u2019 role that has been played to date by Iran\u2019s dwindling but ingeniously maintained fleet of F-14A Tomcat fighters. This would be only marginally useful against a full American offensive, but could make a big difference to Iran\u2019s ability to cover limited targets \u2013 such as an Israeli strike on its nuclear bomb-making facilities.

About 2-4 airframes are remanufactured/upgraded each month so while there may be some \"deal\" made it hasnt transferred into jobs on the ground.",
