Because there is nothing short of invading that country to stop a nut like Kim il-Sung, who is willing to starve his people, from showing off his missile. From a fox news story, October 10, 2006 \u201cThe announcement comes after U.S. responded Monday to North Korea's claim that it had successful detonated a nuclear weapon by circulating a tough draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council condemning the nuclear test and impose wide-ranging sanctions on the country for disregarding the world body's admonishments to not move forward with the test. A copy of the Security Council document obtained by The Associated Press says that the United States wants the resolution to fall under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals explicitly with threats to international peace and security, as well as acts of aggression. Chapter 7 grants the council the authority to impose a range of measures that include breaking diplomatic ties and imposing economic and military sanctions to taking military action. The resolution would enact tough restrictions, including a trade ban on military and luxury items, the power to inspect all cargo entering or leaving the country, and freezing assets connected with its weapons programs. The draft also adds new proposals from Japan that would ban all countries from allowing any North Korean ships in their ports or any North Korean aircraft from taking off or landing in their territory and impose travel restrictions on high-ranking North Korean officials.\u201d Bolton echoed the stern warning delivered earlier in the day by President Bush, who called North Korea's nuclear test \"unacceptable\" and \"provocative,\" and warned the regime of Kim Jong Il that the U.S. would honor its commitments to protect its Asian allies \"The United States will meet the full range of our deterrent and security commitments,\" Bush said during a brief White House appearance. The president said North Korea was \"one of the world's leading proliferators\" of weapons technology, including transfers to Iran and Syria. President Bush called the transfer of nuclear weapons or material would constitute \"a grave threat to the United States, and we hold North Korea fully accountable for the consequences of such actions.\" \"Threats will not lead to a brighter future for the North Korean people,\" Bush said.",

Realistically, if we were NOT WILLING TO WALK THE WALK, we should NOT have TALKED THE TALK. No matter who you support and why, it's hard not to see that failure to back up your verbiage indicates impotence and failure. \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",

From a fox news story, October 10, 2006 \u201cThe announcement comes after U.S. responded Monday to North Korea's claim that it had successful detonated a nuclear weapon by circulating a tough draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council condemning the nuclear test and impose wide-ranging sanctions on the country for disregarding the world body's admonishments to not move forward with the test. A copy of the Security Council document obtained by The Associated Press says that the United States wants the resolution to fall under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals explicitly with threats to international peace and security, as well as acts of aggression. Chapter 7 grants the council the authority to impose a range of measures that include breaking diplomatic ties and imposing economic and military sanctions to taking military action. The resolution would enact tough restrictions, including a trade ban on military and luxury items, the power to inspect all cargo entering or leaving the country, and freezing assets connected with its weapons programs. The draft also adds new proposals from Japan that would ban all countries from allowing any North Korean ships in their ports or any North Korean aircraft from taking off or landing in their territory and impose travel restrictions on high-ranking North Korean officials.\u201d Bolton echoed the stern warning delivered earlier in the day by President Bush, who called North Korea's nuclear test \"unacceptable\" and \"provocative,\" and warned the regime of Kim Jong Il that the U.S. would honor its commitments to protect its Asian allies \"The United States will meet the full range of our deterrent and security commitments,\" Bush said during a brief White House appearance. The president said North Korea was \"one of the world's leading proliferators\" of weapons technology, including transfers to Iran and Syria. President Bush called the transfer of nuclear weapons or material would constitute \"a grave threat to the United States, and we hold North Korea fully accountable for the consequences of such actions.\" \"Threats will not lead to a brighter future for the North Korean people,\" Bush said. none of what you say is relevant make a threat and do nothing is useless and that is what is being done by this gov, bush has nothing to do with this, you can not make a idle threat Give me a break.
