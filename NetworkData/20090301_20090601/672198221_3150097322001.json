It really just sounds like another case of parents and schools horrified at the thought that THEIR kids should be asked to serve in the military. EVERYONE should be asked to serve. We should simply quit focusing so much on high schools and focus on junior colleges and worksites where helicopter parents are (somewhat) less likely to bar military recruiters from approaching. Though I know even colleges will often ban recruiting due to the don't ask/don't tell policy. Sigh. What do y'all think?",

However I believe any school that bans military recruiters should be made to have to ban all recruiters and that includes sports and college recruiters as well.

What I love is the fact that it is the parents who want the military not to hassle their kids, yet it is these same people who do the damned b*tchING and moaning the first time a natural disaster strikes their area. Where are the National Guard they ask etc. Well guess what there is no more National Guard they couldn't get anyone to join thanks to your efforts!!!!. So I would suggest that not only the schools not receive federal funding but the CITIES AND TOWNS where such schools are located also not receive federal funding nor any type of federal assistance when disasters (ie fires, blackouts, riots, blizzards etc) hit their areas.",
