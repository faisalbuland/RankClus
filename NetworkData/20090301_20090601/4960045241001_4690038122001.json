And is D.Rumsfeld who holds a major share of stocks in Tamaflu/Gilead Sceinces as he did back during the Anthrax Scare who had made $15 million selling Tamaflu to State and Federal Agencys to stockpile the anti-viral possibly making another cash haul? Are we looking at the loss of more Civil and Constitutional Rights, ie: forced quarantine, forced inoculation,etc.,etc. Is this the new National Emergancy that the conspiracy freeks keep worning us about??? STAY TUNED and watch the news.",
