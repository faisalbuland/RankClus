By Steve West / scwestusmc In early April the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) distributed a counterterrorism assessment to local law-enforcement folks entitled, \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment.\" The \u201cwarning\u201d has many wondering what the hell they do all day at DHS. This thing reads like a bad Failed City High political science essay. Veterans are angry at the paper's suggestion that law enforcement look out for disgruntled military veterans, as it noted \"the willingness of a small percentage of military personnel to join extremist groups during the 1990s because they were disgruntled, disillusioned or suffering from the psychological effects of war.\" Lord please help those people at DHS think beyond the one isolated McVeigh case. Yes sir, Harvard professors and the New York Times have warned us. Military vets are dumb, dangerous, beat their wives and often they end up as homeless street people - at worst, with brains deformed by combat. A \u201cflashback\u201d is a clear and present danger to polite East Coast society. Horse schit! \u201cI have to tell you, I was the United States Attorney for Arizona in the 90\u2019s when Tim McVeigh bombed the Murrow building in Oklahoma City and unfortunately he was a vet \u2014 that\u2019s where he got his training,\u201d said DHS Director Janet Napolitano. Attention silly girl. The military does not teach making truck bombs using fertilizer and fuel. Your half assed \u201capology\u201d didn\u2019t cut it. This is not the way to bring us together Mr. President. Consider sending her back to your Arizona AA farm team, a personal apology to veterans and distance yourself from what is simply a disgusting and bias propaganda document. Janet missed the factual memo about vets. One of the statistically least likely groups of young men age 18-35 to endanger society is armed forces veterans. If East Coast homeland securiocrats need a tip on where to find dangerous young men just look around D. C. Another good place to check out would be Detroit Michigan, parts of Los Angeles, the Mexican boarder area and don\u2019t forget Saudi Arabia and Islamo Fascists Madrasas\u2019s world wide. Perhaps I\u2019m not objective. I have two sons who are United States Marines. I\u2019m feed up listening to wild ridiculous anti-military speculation from weak people who don\u2019t count any veterans in their circle of friends and have never heard the sonic snap of a bullet that missed.

        "content": "Why Do Harvard Guys & Gals Distrust Our Armed Forces? By Steve West / scwestusmc In early April the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) distributed a counterterrorism assessment to local law-enforcement folks entitled, \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment.\" The \u201cwarning\u201d has many wondering what the hell they do all day at DHS. This thing reads like a bad Failed City High political science essay. Veterans are angry at the paper's suggestion that law enforcement look out for disgruntled military veterans, as it noted \"the willingness of a small percentage of military personnel to join extremist groups during the 1990s because they were disgruntled, disillusioned or suffering from the psychological effects of war.\" Lord please help those people at DHS think beyond the one isolated McVeigh case. Yes sir, Harvard professors and the New York Times have warned us. Military vets are dumb, dangerous, beat their wives and often they end up as homeless street people - at worst, with brains deformed by combat. A \u201cflashback\u201d is a clear and present danger to polite East Coast society.
