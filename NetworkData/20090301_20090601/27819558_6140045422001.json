Rep. Greg Harris's proposed bill would establish civil unions for both gay and straight couples that would provide a \"substantially similar legal relationship\" with the same responsibilities, benefits, and protections that married couples are already privy to. Furthermore, the Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act indicates that religious bodies would not be mandated to recognize the unions. \"It appears that people have a concern with the intermingling of religious and civil marriage,\" Harris, who is gay, told the Chicago Tribune. \"But a lot of people, the vast majority, believe that all couples deserve basic rights.\" More at >>>http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid86879.asp",

As I understand it is that when a couple obtain a properly issued marriage license they are in fact married. The ensuing religious rite is just that, an affirmation of the marriage in God's eye.",
