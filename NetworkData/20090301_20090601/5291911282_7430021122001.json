It was in Sat. 18 April ,2009 Tulsa Newspaper ============================================================================== The Obama Administration, and, specifically, the DHS under Secretary Janet Napolitano, is trying to demonize political dissent. And it's no big surprise that what's directly in their crosshairs is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution! The Obama administration wants to make it clear that any opposition to their political agenda will not be tolerated! Who is funding this attempt to intimidate all of those people who oppose the Obama agenda? YOU, the American taxpayer are! Why would your government spend your money attacking YOU, your First Amendment rights, and your right to oppose the Obama agenda? Because Mr. Obama believes that he and his pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-illegal alien, pro-homosexual marriage, anti-military allies in Congress know what's best for you! And if you do not agree with them, then, you must be a \"right-wing extremist\"! And you must kept under surveillance by the federal government! This calls for IMMEDIATE ACTION. TELL CONGRESS TO STOP THIS ATTACK ON YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH NOW! the Obama Administration, and, specifically, the DHS under Secretary Janet Napolitano, is trying to demonize political dissent. And it's no big surprise that what's directly in their crosshairs is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution! The Obama administration wants to make it clear that any opposition to their political agenda will not be tolerated!

And if you do not agree with them, then, you must be a \"right-wing extremist\"! And you must kept under surveillance by the federal government! This calls for IMMEDIATE ACTION. TELL CONGRESS TO STOP THIS ATTACK ON YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH NOW! The report defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.. That means that all pro-lifers, all opponents of illegal immigration, all opponents of same-sex marriage, all opponents of big government programs, and everyone who believes in limited government is an \"extremist.\" The report further adds that \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. \" That means that if you believe in the Bible and its end-time prophecies, or if you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or if, for any other reason, you have a stockpile of food on hand (as the federal government has suggested you do since 9/11, and as many people in California, and other earthquake prone areas, commonly do), you are an \"extremist.\" Therefore, you and I are now considered \"right-wing extremists,\" that the government needs to be keeping an eye on! Does the threat of the federal government declaring you to be an \"extremist,\" and monitoring your daily activities concern you? Does that threat make you less likely to speak out on issues and dear to you, but which the Obama administration disagrees with you on? Will the government branding you an \"extremist\" impact your life negatively in any way? If your answer to any of these 3 questions is YES, then you need to do something about this threat to your Constitutional Right of Freedom of Speech! AND YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABUT IT RIGHT NOW! TELL CONGRESS TO STOP THIS ATTACK ON YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH NOW! THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED! DO YOU REALIZE THAT JUST BY MY WRITING THIS E-MAIL, I WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN EXTREMIST UNDER THIS DHS REPORT! This report was released soon after a state government agency report in February: the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) report titled, \"MIAC Strategic Report: The Modern Militia Movement.\" In this \"law enforcement sensitive\" report, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon; John Britt, Director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety; James Keathley, Colonel of the Missouri State Highway Patrol; and Van Godsey, Director of MIAC categorize certain citizens as being potential, violence-prone, \"militia members.\" According to the MIAC report, if you oppose any of the following, you could qualify for being profiled as a potential dangerous \"militia member\": The United Nations The New World Order Gun Control Violation of Posse Comitatus Act The Federal Reserve The Income Tax The Ammunition and Accountability Act A Constitutional Convention The North American Union Universal Service Program Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Abortion Illegal Immigration Well, there you have it! You see? You ARE a dangerous rightwing extremist! As ridiculous as that report seems, it was distributed to law enforcement officials across the state of Missouri. And it wasn't until the state government of Missouri was FLOODED with protests from patriotic Americans from all across the United States, that the report was denounced, and retracted. Now, it's happened again -- but this time, at the Federal level! Our own government is turning against us, and unless YOU, and every person that you know, acts NOW,, it will just keep getting WORSE! TELL CONGRESS TO STOP THIS ATTACK ON YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH NOW! the Obama Administration, and, specifically, the DHS under Secretary Janet Napolitano, is trying to demonize political dissent.

That means that all pro-lifers, all opponents of illegal immigration, all opponents of same-sex marriage, all opponents of big government programs, and everyone who believes in limited government is an \"extremist.\" The report further adds that \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. \" That means that if you believe in the Bible and its end-time prophecies, or if you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or if, for any other reason, you have a stockpile of food on hand (as the federal government has suggested you do since 9/11, and as many people in California, and other earthquake prone areas, commonly do), you are an \"extremist.\" Therefore, you and I are now considered \"right-wing extremists,\" that the government needs to be keeping an eye on!

That means that all pro-lifers, all opponents of illegal immigration, all opponents of same-sex marriage, all opponents of big government programs, and everyone who believes in limited government is an \"extremist.\" The report further adds that \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. \" That means that if you believe in the Bible and its end-time prophecies, or if you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or if, for any other reason, you have a stockpile of food on hand (as the federal government has suggested you do since 9/11, and as many people in California, and other earthquake prone areas, commonly do), you are an \"extremist.\" Therefore, you and I are now considered \"right-wing extremists,\" that the government needs to be keeping an eye on! Does the threat of the federal government declaring you to be an \"extremist,\" and monitoring your daily activities concern you? Does that threat make you less likely to speak out on issues and dear to you, but which the Obama administration disagrees with you on? Will the government branding you an \"extremist\" impact your life negatively in any way? If your answer to any of these 3 questions is YES, then you need to do something about this threat to your Constitutional Right of Freedom of Speech! AND YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABUT IT RIGHT NOW! TELL CONGRESS TO STOP THIS ATTACK ON YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH NOW! THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED! DO YOU REALIZE THAT JUST BY MY WRITING THIS E-MAIL, I WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN EXTREMIST UNDER THIS DHS REPORT! This report was released soon after a state government agency report in February: the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) report titled, \"MIAC Strategic Report: The Modern Militia Movement.\" In this \"law enforcement sensitive\" report, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon; John Britt, Director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety; James Keathley, Colonel of the Missouri State Highway Patrol; and Van Godsey, Director of MIAC categorize certain citizens as being potential, violence-prone, \"militia members.\" According to the MIAC report, if you oppose any of the following, you could qualify for being profiled as a potential dangerous \"militia member\": The United Nations The New World Order Gun Control Violation of Posse Comitatus Act The Federal Reserve The Income Tax The Ammunition and Accountability Act A Constitutional Convention The North American Union Universal Service Program Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Abortion Illegal Immigration Well, there you have it! You see? You ARE a dangerous rightwing extremist! As ridiculous as that report seems, it was distributed to law enforcement officials across the state of Missouri. And it wasn't until the state government of Missouri was FLOODED with protests from patriotic Americans from all across the United States, that the report was denounced, and retracted. Now, it's happened again -- but this time, at the Federal level! Our own government is turning against us, and unless YOU, and every person that you know, acts NOW,, it will just keep getting WORSE! TELL CONGRESS TO STOP THIS ATTACK ON YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH NOW! the Obama Administration, and, specifically, the DHS under Secretary Janet Napolitano, is trying to demonize political dissent. Sincerely, Gary Kreep Executive Director United States Justice Foundation SEABEE'S \"CAN DO\", \"HAVE DONE\", AND WILL DO SO FOREVER. GOD BLESS AMERICA",

It was in Sat. 18 April ,2009 Tulsa Newspaper ============================================================================== The Obama Administration, and, specifically, the DHS under Secretary Janet Napolitano, is trying to demonize political dissent. And it's no big surprise that what's directly in their crosshairs is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution! The Obama administration wants to make it clear that any opposition to their political agenda will not be tolerated! under a totalitarian leader! It's only gonna get worse, as time goes by he will make more changes. Few will be for improvement, but absolute power! Dont' be What we have here is a totalitarian goverment surprised, more is coming, remember in his campaign speeches, he said, \"Change is comin\". He didn't lie about that! Who is funding this attempt to intimidate all of those people who oppose the Obama agenda? YOU, the American taxpayer are! Why would your government spend your money attacking YOU, your First Amendment rights, and your right to oppose the Obama agenda? Because Mr. Obama believes that he and his pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-illegal alien, pro-****sexual marriage, anti-military allies in Congress know what's best for you! And if you do not agree with them, then, you must be a \"right-wing extremist\"! And you must kept under surveillance by the federal government! This calls for IMMEDIATE ACTION.

TELL CONGRESS TO STOP THIS ATTACK ON YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH NOW! The report defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.. That means that all pro-lifers, all opponents of illegal immigration, all opponents of same-sex marriage, all opponents of big government programs, and everyone who believes in limited government is an \"extremist.\" The report further adds that \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. \" That means that if you believe in the Bible and its end-time prophecies, or if you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or if, for any other reason, you have a stockpile of food on hand (as the federal government has suggested you do since 9/11, and as many people in California, and other earthquake prone areas, commonly do), you are an \"extremist.\" Therefore, you and I are now considered \"right-wing extremists,\" that the government needs to be keeping an eye on! Does the threat of the federal government declaring you to be an \"extremist,\" and monitoring your daily activities concern you? Does that threat make you less likely to speak out on issues and dear to you, but which the Obama administration disagrees with you on? Will the government branding you an \"extremist\" impact your life negatively in any way? If your answer to any of these 3 questions is YES, then you need to do something about this threat to your Constitutional Right of Freedom of Speech! AND YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABUT IT RIGHT NOW!

DO YOU REALIZE THAT JUST BY MY WRITING THIS E-MAIL, I WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN EXTREMIST UNDER THIS DHS REPORT! This report was released soon after a state government agency report in February: the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) report titled, \"MIAC Strategic Report: The Modern Militia Movement.\" In this \"law enforcement sensitive\" report, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon; John Britt, Director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety; James Keathley, Colonel of the Missouri State Highway Patrol; and Van Godsey, Director of MIAC categorize certain citizens as being potential, violence-prone, \"militia members.\" According to the MIAC report, if you oppose any of the following, you could qualify for being profiled as a potential dangerous \"militia member\": The United Nations The New World Order Gun Control Violation of Posse Comitatus Act The Federal Reserve The Income Tax The Ammunition and Accountability Act A Constitutional Convention The North American Union Universal Service Program Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Abortion Illegal Immigration Well, there you have it! You see? You ARE a dangerous rightwing extremist! As ridiculous as that report seems, it was distributed to law enforcement officials across the state of Missouri. And it wasn't until the state government of Missouri was FLOODED with protests from patriotic Americans from all across the United States, that the report was denounced, and retracted. Now, it's happened again -- but this time, at the Federal level! Our own government is turning against us, and unless YOU, and every person that you know, acts NOW,, it will just keep getting WORSE!

Remember, in his campaign speeches, he said, \"change is coming\" he didn't lie about that. How long are we going to wait for Obama to make more changes? Apathy is dangerous when we stand by while we shrug or shoulders and say, \"Oh Well, it's going to get better\". \"The fox is in the chicken coop\" Study Biblical prophesy, it pretty much say's what is happening today!
