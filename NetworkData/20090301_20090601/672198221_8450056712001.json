        "content": "Four pro-Armenian Congressmen sent a letter to U.S. President Barack Obama urging him to keep his promise of recognizing the Armenian claims regarding the 1915 incidents as the issue is expected to be discussed during the his upcoming visit to Turkey. \"During your upcoming trip to Turkey... and in discussions with your advisors over how to commemorate the events of 1915-1923, you will doubtless be counseled by some to continue the practice of avoiding the truth in favor of short-term political expediency,\" the Congressmen said in the letter to Obama, according to a written statement issued by Washington-based Armenian Assembly of America. The letter, signed by Democrats Adam Schiff of California and Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Republicans George Radanovich of California and Mark Kirk of Illinois, comes shortly after the announcement of Obama's visit to Turkey early in April. \"We do not minimize Ankara's threats of adverse action when you recognize the genocide, or when Congress takes action to formally recognize the genocide, but we believe that our alliance is strong enough to withstand the truth,\" the letter added. The letter, in which Congressmen also thanked Obama for his strong record in support of Armenian claims, is the latest step taken by Armenian lobby organizations to have their claims recognized by the new administration. During the election campaign, Obama had pledged to recognize the Armenian claims, a move seen as a risk factor by Turkey that will harm the mutual relations as well as the reconciliation period between Ankara and Yerevan. Armenia, with the backing of the diaspora, claims up to 1.5 million of their kin were slaughtered in orchestrated killings in 1915. Turkey rejects the claims saying that 300,000 Armenians, along with at least as many Turks, died in civil strife that emerged when Armenians took up arms, backed by Russia, for independence in eastern Anatolia. Turkey has offered to form a joint commission to investigate what happened in 1915 and opened up all official archives, but Armenia has continued to drag its feet on accepting the offer. OBAMA'S POSITION STILL UNCERTAIN Although Obama had promised to recognize the Armenian claims, the American ambassador to Ankara said the issue is being evaluated by the new administration and a final decision is yet to be made. \"The issue was discussed during (Secretary of State Hillary) Clinton's visit. The Turkish officials said (any recognition) will hurt the Turkish people and negatively affect relations. Obama will also listen to what Turkish officials will say,\" James Jeffrey told Radikal daily in an interview published on Thursday. The Washington administration supports the renewed dialogue between the Turkish and Armenian governments and believes progress should be made not only in opening the border between the two countries but also on the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Radikal quoted Jeffrey as saying. \"We, just like the previous administrations, have not determined a final stance on how to commemorate April 24,\" Jeffrey added. The date of April 24 is commemorated by Armenians as a day of remembrance for the 1915 incidents, for which U.S. presidents issue a letter of respect, which have so far refrained from including the word \"genocide\". \"http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/world/11191918.asp?gid=237\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

Dave If there were as much evidence that there was a massacre of the Armenians on the same scale as the physical evidence of the killing fields and Pol Pot's effect on Cambodia, we wouldn't be having this discussion. Pol Pot's regime not only uprooted the Cambodian people in an attempt to 'improve' Kampuchea, he also killed significant numbers of his own people to do that. There was no war or other disruption to be blamed, nor to excuse what happened. What happened to the Turkish Armenians is certainly more nebulous, and possibly comparatively overstated. Where are the bonefields and grave yards? There is 'photographic' evidence of 'massacres' but none show more than 50 bodies and there aren't enough photos to show more than a thousand dead. There are no photographs of the Great Irish Famine - another 'genocide' which has lost 'magnitude' given recent historical study. Written accounts are highly subjective and the government records have either been expunged, or never recorded an organized massacre. Third party reports could be ascribed a value that was determined by the belligerent status of the writer. Bottom line, after the First War, Armenians wound up scattering all over the world. But then, so did millions of others. All genocides, in Russia, in the last war, in China, in Turkey, Rwanda - where ever, should be the bailiwick of the historian, not the politician. Do you think the Irish, or the Armenian would forget their 'heritage' even if it was proven 100% wrong? Geez, there are still Americans waiting for Iraqi WMDs. Buying into something holus-bolus without even considering that it might be a heartfelt belief rather than fact, has led governments into great error, amd even genocide, in past times. Study, think, learn and hopefully we'll improve. Groupthink does nobody any good. This message has been edited. Last edited by: popsiq, Wed 18 March 2009 01:15 PM",
