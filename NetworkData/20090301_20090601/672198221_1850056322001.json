Another major difference is that most other countries pay for most of the cost of the transportation infrastructure using the fuel tax, road use taxes, etc. while in the USA a VERY large % of this cost is paid for from the GENERAL tax fund. Paying for the infrastructure using use taxes make the cost a LOT clearer to voters. IMO we should switch over to paying for the transportation infrastructure (roads, etc) with fuel and other use taxes and the money should ONLY be used for that purpose.",

        "reply": " Another major difference is that most other countries pay for most of the cost of the transportation infrastructure using the fuel tax, road use taxes, etc. while in the USA a VERY large % of this cost is paid for from the GENERAL tax fund. Paying for the infrastructure using use taxes make the cost a LOT clearer to voters. IMO we should switch over to paying for the transportation infrastructure (roads, etc) with fuel and other use taxes and the money should ONLY be used for that purpose.",

Uh Pardon Me Eag, but you failed to mention this is a W / Rep plan from the beginning... \"2007, Congress passed and President George Bush signed legislation aimed at increasing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to at least 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2020, up from 27.5 today. \" You also conveniently failed to mention that the savings in gas would off set the price of the car. Which, BTW, why in the world would the price of the car even have to go up? Unless your adding new components and not taking any components away? I think that cost raise is BS with The Oil Companies lobbyist finger prints all over it. \"But CAFE proponents argue that there is a bright side\u2014the higher costs for the gas-sipping cars will be offset by lower gas bills. For example, a car driven 12,500 miles per year at 27.5 mpg would use 454 gallons of gas annually. Raising the mileage to 35 mpg reduces that figure to 357 gallons per year. So the new California standards would save drivers an average of 100 gallons per year. At $1.50 per gallon that comes to $150 per year; at $4 per gallon it comes to $400.\" Something needs to give and this is a good start. I am glad President Of The United States Barack Obama is leading the way on energy efficiency. Taking over from where W left off on this one, good job POTUS! Read the entire article folks, the heading and the comment to follow is somewhat biased. so sorry no saveings in fuel costs, to maintain their profits the oil companys will raise the price of gas when the autos become more fuel effient... guarenteed... GUARENTEED!!!!",
