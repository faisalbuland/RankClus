He didn't. And he has the gun, I guess, so he sprayed me,\" said Desiderio Fortunato, a Coquitlam, B.C., resident who frequently crosses the border to visit his second home in the state of Washington. \"Is that illegal in the United States, asking an officer to be polite?\" The incident occurred on Monday at the Aldergrove border crossing, east of Vancouver, shortly after 12 p.m. Mr. Fortunato, a dance studio director, was travelling to his home in Blaine, Wash., to retrieve a wallet his wife had left during their most recent visit. He said he was questioned by a border officer who demanded he turn off his car and, when asked to make the request more politely, threatened to spray him with his pepper gun if he did not comply. \"I just felt I should stand my ground about it. I should not be treated like that. No matter what kind of position you are in, if you want respect you have to show respect,\" he said yesterday. \"I asked him three times and when I didn't turn the car off, because he didn't say please, he pepper sprayed me.... It was terrible. For half an hour or so I couldn't see anything.\" (...) Once, he said, he asked a Canadian border agent to be more polite when requesting documents, to which the agent responded with a sheepish \"please.\" (See the difference?)",

In that vein, I also always carry my naturalization papers and my military ID. These guys are only trying to do their job, and similarly if one is stopped for a traffic violation by a cop, they're \"in charge,\" and the easier that you make that transaction for them by not being a jerk or playing \"word games,\" the easier and better it is ultimately for you. It's just common sense; you're on their \"turf,\" so simply abide by their rules.",

No heated words were exchanged, but it seemed as though the officer had a menacing air about him and a condescending manner of asking questions. A little politeness does go a long way, although in this case I think the Canadian gentleman was a fool. Strangely enough, the Border agents at the Charlotte, NC airport POE seem to be able to conduct the entrance interview in a polite and efficient manner every time (for me, anyway). Maybe their supervisors stress that the job can be done effectively while maintaining a professional and polite customer service attitude.",

I began traveling between the USA and Canada when I was 9 months old, and since then, have typically crossed the border several times a year.

It used to be easy. Never any problems. The border customs agents on the Canadian side were always a bit more polite (you don't have to be a jerk to be effective, you know), but seriously, in recent years, the American customs agents have become power-tripping megalomaniacs. They're rude, obnoxious, pushy, and offensive, even when you're being as polite as possible. I shudder at how much worse it must be for anyone who crosses the border who is NOT a Caucasian American citizen who speaks unaccented American English. If that guy lives near the US/Canada border and crosses often, I'm not surprised that he's finally reached his limit of being treated like a criminal for wanting to cross a border that, at one point not too long ago, didn't even require a passport. So, YES, he should have complied with the orders of the customs agent at the border, but really, how hard would it have been for the border agent to take a deep breath, realize he was being a jerk, and say, \"Please?\" Ego-tripping power-hungry jerk.",

I began traveling between the USA and Canada when I was 9 months old, and since then, have typically crossed the border several times a year. In fact, on the way back from my grandparents' house, we'd often cross to the US from Canada, stay in a hotel in Maine overnight, and then cross BACK in the morning for a cup of Tim Horton's coffee and bagels, and then cross back AGAIN to head back home towards New Hampshire. It used to be easy. Never any problems. The border customs agents on the Canadian side were always a bit more polite (you don't have to be a jerk to be effective, you know), but seriously, in recent years, the American customs agents have become power-tripping megalomaniacs. They're rude, obnoxious, pushy, and offensive, even when you're being as polite as possible. I shudder at how much worse it must be for anyone who crosses the border who is NOT a Caucasian American citizen who speaks unaccented American English. If that guy lives near the US/Canada border and crosses often, I'm not surprised that he's finally reached his limit of being treated like a criminal for wanting to cross a border that, at one point not too long ago, didn't even require a passport. So, YES, he should have complied with the orders of the customs agent at the border, but really, how hard would it have been for the border agent to take a deep breath, realize he was being a jerk, and say, \"Please?\" Ego-tripping power-hungry jerk.",
