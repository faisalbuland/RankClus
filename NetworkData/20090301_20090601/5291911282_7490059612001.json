Amongst other job titles I hold a certificate for NJ Animal Control Officer. Too many states have to lax of laws that allow idiots to own animals they have no right to own. Thank goodness in NJ it is illegal to privately own a primate(any type). I was at a chemical immobilazation class & the instructor was saying Ohio is up there amongst the most lax. He had to respond to some clown who owned a lion which got loose! Call me crazy, but if an animal can look at you & think \"yummy\", you shouldn't own that animal.",

Monkey bites are the number one suspect in AIDs making the leap from animals to people... The same with the Ebola Virus. That alone should be enough for all States to say NO!!
