I am vehemently opposed to US military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, but that does not make me anti-American. One can be anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, anti-whatever, and it's quite acceptable. However, when one speaks out against Israel, one is automatically labeled anti-semitic, and that is cause for wailing and gnashing of teeth in your world. Like it or not, it's not \"yet\" a crime in the US to be anti-semitic. However, once pending hate-crime legislation is passed, it will then become a thought-crime to express anti-Israel views in this country. I'm impressed that you have saved my post from awhile back. That post was in response to \"OldMole\" expressing disappoint in me when I stated that I believed the Protocols were genuine. IMO, OldMole ranked in the top 2 or 3 posters ever on this forum.

Our logic in selling the planes to Russians is as follows: We sell them the planes, and Russians will not (hopefully) sell AA missiles to Iran. Russia has already pledged that it will not sell the S-300 to Iran if we scraped the ABM shield (which we most likely will)! Talk about completely ignoring other available sources, the international situation, and rushing to make a comment! It is very hard to understand, bu give it a try.",

I am vehemently opposed to US military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, but that does not make me anti-American. One can be anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, anti-whatever, and it's quite acceptable. However, when one speaks out against Israel, one is automatically labeled anti-semitic, and that is cause for wailing and gnashing of teeth in your world.
