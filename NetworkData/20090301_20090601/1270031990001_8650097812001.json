It was actually the middle of the movie and the conclusion that I thought were the best parts. Generally, I try to take a movie as a whole, and not judge it by the first 20 minutes.

I don't know if anyone would pay to see him put on a serious documentary highlighting his points (which are very valid, in my opinion). This would be like Ann Coulter trying to do stand up comedy.

That something does NOT have to be life threatening, destructive, or simply uncomfortable. It must motivate you, to do the work, to see who you REALLY are though. You must be willing to stand naked in front of the mirror of your mind, SEEING the scars and how you got them, the pimples, the warts, ALL of it, and take each answer as it comes, honestly, no matter how disparageing to your self image it may be, no matter how painful the truth is, and incorporating it into who, and WHAT, you truly are.

Never mind giving credit to God, for the very life we enjoy!!! I sincerely believe, that when people see how little it is, that they truly \"control\", it is of a power to drop most to their knees!!! It scares the average person to their core, to realise the helplessness that each of us truly labors under, when we tout ourselves so highly, unthinkingly!! Then when you see, as I have, the indomitable courage of the aged to face life on it's own terms as the end come rushing toward them, it is the most humbling thing to endure as you witness it. The posturing of the politicians, and the power that people ascribe to them, to control their existence is laughable. When you KNOW the truth about life.

The stories always have a human protagonist don't they? There's a reason for that, the POINT, is how the HUMAN responded, NOT God!! God is consistant, even predictable, while through out the Bible man is not!! All the variables, the foibles, the frailty, the dishonesty, the thieving, murderous nature of us all, is exposed for all to see, and people concentrate on God when they ought to be examining themselves!!

I would express it this way: Most atheists I have heard and read have freed themselves from reliance upon an invisible, inaudible being. They have instead chosen the path of reason, logic, and scientific understanding. They recognize that their fellow humans are the only \"power\" to be feared, especially when those fellow humans use religion or politics to further their own aims. These atheists can be characterized by a strong reliance upon themselves, since their own mind is the only one they have any likelihood of ever truly knowing. However, they are still able to form loving bonds with their fellow men (or women!), because they are, after all, human. Your comments about loss of surety-of-self seem to me to be just another way of saying, \"You can only rely on God.\" Well, I and many other atheists tried that for years, before I \"asked the tough questions.\" I gradually came to realize that it was just a pattern of a) listening for something, b) hearing nothing, c) making something up, and d) ascribing what I had made up to \"God speaking to me.\" So eventually, I simply cut out the middleman. You talk about \"stand(ing) naked in front of the mirror of your mind...\" I believe you have done that when it comes to yourself as a person. But have you ever done that when it comes to your religious beliefs? Have you ever spent weeks, months, years, pondering the reasons you believe, trying various hypotheses, examining evidence or lack thereof? Have you ever put your beliefs on trial? If so, did you give your beliefs a \"get out of jail free\" card by deciding that rigorous rules of evidence, reason, causality, etc. don't apply to God? If you counter that those are man's rules, then perhaps you haven't truly examined your beliefs. But to quote you, \"I have learned, that very damned few of us will do that.\" In my experience, the thing that \"scares the average person to their core\" is the idea of their own non-existence. They can't cope with the concept that one day, they will simply cease to be. That's the chief reason people cling to religion. Close behind that is the thought that their deceased loved ones are gone forever. Close behind THAT is the concept that (as I've heard so many believers say) without a belief in the hereafter, life would have no meaning. The unifying theme of all these is that religion gives people comfort. However, that doesn't make it true.",

It was actually the middle of the movie and the conclusion that I thought were the best parts. Generally, I try to take a movie as a whole, and not judge it by the first 20 minutes.

It scares the average person to their core, to realise the helplessness that each of us truly labors under, when we tout ourselves so highly, unthinkingly!! Then when you see, as I have, the indomitable courage of the aged to face life on it's own terms as the end come rushing toward them, it is the most humbling thing to endure as you witness it.

NOT what God wants!! BUT, the stories of HUMAN BEINGS and how they interacted with each other, and the things they SHOULD have learned about God, and didn't, along the way. The stories always have a human protagonist don't they? There's a reason for that, the POINT, is how the HUMAN responded, NOT God!! God is consistant, even predictable, while through out the Bible man is not!! All the variables, the foibles, the frailty, the dishonesty, the thieving, murderous nature of us all, is exposed for all to see, and people concentrate on God when they ought to be examining themselves!! THAT is the point!! Self examinination and THEN, apply the lessons learned in the BOOK! So, all in all, that is why we don't see it, till we look back!! T",

All the variables, the foibles, the frailty, the dishonesty, the thieving, murderous nature of us all, is exposed for all to see, and people concentrate on God when they ought to be examining themselves!! THAT is the point!! Self examinination and THEN, apply the lessons learned in the BOOK! So, all in all, that is why we don't see it, till we look back!! T",

        "content": "Bruce, I have to quibble with your statement, quote: The atheists have, by and large, bestowed the fealty that you and I feel toward God, to men, politics, and themselves. I would express it this way: Most atheists I have heard and read have freed themselves from reliance upon an invisible, inaudible being. They have instead chosen the path of reason, logic, and scientific understanding. They recognize that their fellow humans are the only \"power\" to be feared, especially when those fellow humans use religion or politics to further their own aims. These atheists can be characterized by a strong reliance upon themselves, since their own mind is the only one they have any likelihood of ever truly knowing. However, they are still able to form loving bonds with their fellow men (or women!), because they are, after all, human. Your comments about loss of surety-of-self seem to me to be just another way of saying, \"You can only rely on God.\" Well, I and many other atheists tried that for years, before I \"asked the tough questions.\" I gradually came to realize that it was just a pattern of a) listening for something, b) hearing nothing, c) making something up, and d) ascribing what I had made up to \"God speaking to me.\" So eventually, I simply cut out the middleman. You talk about \"stand(ing) naked in front of the mirror of your mind...\" I believe you have done that when it comes to yourself as a person. But have you ever done that when it comes to your religious beliefs? Have you ever spent weeks, months, years, pondering the reasons you believe, trying various hypotheses, examining evidence or lack thereof? Have you ever put your beliefs on trial? If so, did you give your beliefs a \"get out of jail free\" card by deciding that rigorous rules of evidence, reason, causality, etc. don't apply to God? If you counter that those are man's rules, then perhaps you haven't truly examined your beliefs. But to quote you, \"I have learned, that very damned few of us will do that.\" In my experience, the thing that \"scares the average person to their core\" is the idea of their own non-existence. They can't cope with the concept that one day, they will simply cease to be. That's the chief reason people cling to religion. Close behind that is the thought that their deceased loved ones are gone forever. Close behind THAT is the concept that (as I've heard so many believers say) without a belief in the hereafter, life would have no meaning. The unifying theme of all these is that religion gives people comfort. However, that doesn't make it true.",
