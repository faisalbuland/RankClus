Face it Bush destroyed the Republican party and it will become more and more insignificant with each Passing day as more and more jump ship. What Bush did in the name of the American people under the pretense of terrorism is unacceptable and will be dealt with as people wake up. June 25: Major Action in DC to Demand Prosecution of Torturers Plus, Breaking News: Members of Congress Call for Special Prosecutor! IndictBushNow and a broad number of organizations are coming together for a major action on June 25, 2009 in front of the Justice Department in Washington DC. Yesterday, John Conyers, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and thirteen of his Judiciary colleagues formally appealed to Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. This dramatic action in Congress is a direct result of the pressure generated by you and millions of other people. The letter to the Attorney General reads: \"there can be little doubt that the public interest will be served by appointment of a special counsel. The authorization and use of interrogation techniques that likely amounted to torture has generated tremendous concern and outrage in this country, and has harmed our legal and moral standing in the world.\" More than 400,000 people have signed petitions calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. A coalition of civil rights and human rights organization presented 250,000 petition signatures to the Attorney General last week. More than 150,000 people have signed the petition at IndictBushNow. The people of every country must see that We The People of the United States are uniting to demand accountability for those who committed great crimes in our name. The crimes are too great to let pass. Secret prisons, extraordinary renditions and torture, massive spying on the people of the United States and waging an unprovoked war of aggression on Iraq based on lies and deceit. People are coming to Washington DC on June 25 from all over the country to say loud and clear: No One Is Above the Law! Please organize a June 25 IndictBushNow committee in your local area to bring people to Washington DC or, if you are to far away, organize a local June 25th action at the Federal Building or in another central location in your city or town. Posters, leaflets and logistics information for June 25 will be available in the coming days.",

Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps?

America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son. But in the end we averted World War III with three Middle East countries and kept America safe from a suitcase bomb. \u201cIn 2004, we thwarted the spread of a deadly weaponized virus strain. The following year, after some unsuccessful attempts at sensory disorientation with detainees, we got a torture specialist who had a way with a taser and his trusty syringe. Strict measures, like breaking fingers one by one and using an electrical cord from a lamp to shock a suspect, were necessary. We were under attack by a terrorist named Habib Marwan who controlled a bunch of Middle East terrorist cells. They were planning to meltdown nuclear power plants across the country, shoot down Air Force One and set off a nuclear missile. On top of that, we were dealing with a mole in our counterterrorism unit. \u201cIn 2006, after an incident with the man who made history by becoming the first black president ...\u201d Senator Feinstein interrupted: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Cheney, are you talking about Barack Obama?\u201d \u201cI said the first black president,\u201d Cheney snapped, before continuing: \u201cOur interrogator needed to do some things outside protocol. There was an exploding vest, a foot digging into a wound, an injection of pain-inducing hyoscine-pentothal, a threat to cut out the eyes of a suspect being interrogated unless he confessed where the Sentox nerve gas cannisters were.

        "content": "Interrogator training provides interrogators with the basic standards for interrogations in detainee operations. This is the \u201cTHINK\u201d model: 1. Treat all detainees with the same standard. a. DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, 9 May 2006: DoD personnel will \u201ccomply with the Law of War during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.\u201d b. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006: \u201cAll detainees shall be treated humanely, and in accordance with U.S. Law, the Law of War, and applicable U.S. policy.\u201d c. From an interrogator\u2019s perspective, status may matter in the following situations: (1) Use of the separation approach technique: only authorized for unlawful enemy combatants;and (2) Use of the incentives: may not deny the detainee anything entitled by law (there is a difference in entitlements between a civilian internee, lawful enemy combatant, an unlawful enemy combatant, and a retained person). 2. Humane treatment is the standard. Enclosure 4 of DoDD 2310.01E is called the detainee treatment policy. It provides the minimum standards of humane treatment for all detainees and applies to detainees from the point of capture on. a. Adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; b. Free exercise of religion, consistent with the requirements for detention; c. All detainees will be respected as human beings. They will be protected against threats or acts of violence including rape, forced prostitution, assault, theft, public curiosity, bodily injury, and reprisals. They will not be subjected to medical or scientific experiments. They will not be subjected to sensory deprivation. This list is not exclusive. 3. Interrogators interrogate. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09: (1) Only trained and certified interrogators may interrogate; (2) Non-interrogators and non-trained/non-certified interrogators may only ask direct questions, may not use any other approach/technique, and may not \u201cset the conditions\u201d for an interrogation. b. Non-interrogators and non-trained/certified interrogators may provide passively obtained information to trained and certified interrogators for use during interrogations. For example, an MP may tell the interrogator about leaders in the facility, habits of a detainee, groups that have formed in the facility, and other information that the MP has observed during the performance of his/her duties. 4. Need to report abuses. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09, all DoD personnel (including contractors) must report any \u201csuspected or alleged violation of DoD policy, procedures, or applicable law relating to intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings or tactical questioning, for which there is credible information.\u201d b. FM 2-22.3 requires \u201call persons who have knowledge of suspected or alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions are obligated by regulation to report such matters.\u201d c. Reports should be made to the chain of command unless the chain of command is involved, in which case the report should be made to one of the following: SJA, IG, Chaplain, or Provost Marshal. d. Failure to report may be a UCMJ violation (either Article 92, dereliction of duty, or Article 134, misprision of a serious offense). e. Must report violations by anyone, including but not limited to: another interrogator, interpreter, host nation personnel, coalition personnel, or a representative of another government agency (OGA). 5. Know the approved techniques. Only those techniques listed in Chapter 8 of FM 2-22.3 are approved and therefore lawful techniques pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. C. Recent Developments. 1. DoDD 3115.09, Department of Defense Intelligence Interrogations, Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning, 3 November 2005. Under this directive, all captured or detained personnel must be treated humanely. The directive requires all DoD personnel to report any reportable incidents. The use of dogs as a part of an interrogation is prohibited by this directive. The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for establishing training and certification standards for interrogators. 2. Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA of 2005) (part of the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub. Law No. 109-163). a. \u00a7 1002(a): No person in the custody or under the effective control of the Department of Defense or under detention in a Department of Defense facility shall be subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. b. \u00a7 1003(a): No individual in the custody or under the physical control of the United States Government, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. c. \u00a7 1005: Includes provisions for status review of detainees outside the U.S. d. Based on enactment of the DTA of 2005, only those approach techniques contained in Chapter 8 and Appendix M of FM 2-22.3 are legal. Unlike most doctrine, this is not a recommendation for how to conduct operations, FM 2-22.3 defines the legal limits of interrogation operations. e. The DTA of 2005 applies to all DoD personnel, both military and civilian, all the time, everywhere; and to all others conducting interrogation operations in DoD facilities. 3. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006. This directive requires that all detainees be treated humanely.

June 25: Major Action in DC to Demand Prosecution of Torturers Plus, Breaking News: Members of Congress Call for Special Prosecutor! IndictBushNow and a broad number of organizations are coming together for a major action on June 25, 2009 in front of the Justice Department in Washington DC. Yesterday, John Conyers, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and thirteen of his Judiciary colleagues formally appealed to Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. This dramatic action in Congress is a direct result of the pressure generated by you and millions of other people. The letter to the Attorney General reads: \"there can be little doubt that the public interest will be served by appointment of a special counsel. The authorization and use of interrogation techniques that likely amounted to torture has generated tremendous concern and outrage in this country, and has harmed our legal and moral standing in the world.\" More than 400,000 people have signed petitions calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. A coalition of civil rights and human rights organization presented 250,000 petition signatures to the Attorney General last week. More than 150,000 people have signed the petition at IndictBushNow. The people of every country must see that We The People of the United States are uniting to demand accountability for those who committed great crimes in our name. The crimes are too great to let pass. Secret prisons, extraordinary renditions and torture, massive spying on the people of the United States and waging an unprovoked war of aggression on Iraq based on lies and deceit. People are coming to Washington DC on June 25 from all over the country to say loud and clear: No One Is Above the Law! Please organize a June 25 IndictBushNow committee in your local area to bring people to Washington DC or, if you are to far away, organize a local June 25th action at the Federal Building or in another central location in your city or town. Posters, leaflets and logistics information for June 25 will be available in the coming days.",

The dems have the 60 votes now to stop a filibuster and get things done. So guess which tea party obama is going to respond to? Face it Bush destroyed the Republican party and it will become more and more insignificant with each Passing day as more and more jump ship. What Bush did in the name of the American people under the pretense of terrorism is unacceptable and will be dealt with as people wake up. June 25: Major Action in DC to Demand Prosecution of Torturers Plus, Breaking News: Members of Congress Call for Special Prosecutor! IndictBushNow and a broad number of organizations are coming together for a major action on June 25, 2009 in front of the Justice Department in Washington DC. Yesterday, John Conyers, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and thirteen of his Judiciary colleagues formally appealed to Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. This dramatic action in Congress is a direct result of the pressure generated by you and millions of other people. The letter to the Attorney General reads: \"there can be little doubt that the public interest will be served by appointment of a special counsel. The authorization and use of interrogation techniques that likely amounted to torture has generated tremendous concern and outrage in this country, and has harmed our legal and moral standing in the world.\" More than 400,000 people have signed petitions calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor.

This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps?

        "content": "Interrogator training provides interrogators with the basic standards for interrogations in detainee operations. This is the \u201cTHINK\u201d model: 1. Treat all detainees with the same standard. a. DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, 9 May 2006: DoD personnel will \u201ccomply with the Law of War during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.\u201d b. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006: \u201cAll detainees shall be treated humanely, and in accordance with U.S. Law, the Law of War, and applicable U.S. policy.\u201d c. From an interrogator\u2019s perspective, status may matter in the following situations: (1) Use of the separation approach technique: only authorized for unlawful enemy combatants;and (2) Use of the incentives: may not deny the detainee anything entitled by law (there is a difference in entitlements between a civilian internee, lawful enemy combatant, an unlawful enemy combatant, and a retained person). 2. Humane treatment is the standard. Enclosure 4 of DoDD 2310.01E is called the detainee treatment policy. It provides the minimum standards of humane treatment for all detainees and applies to detainees from the point of capture on. a. Adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; b. Free exercise of religion, consistent with the requirements for detention; c. All detainees will be respected as human beings. They will be protected against threats or acts of violence including rape, forced prostitution, assault, theft, public curiosity, bodily injury, and reprisals. They will not be subjected to medical or scientific experiments. They will not be subjected to sensory deprivation. This list is not exclusive. 3. Interrogators interrogate. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09: (1) Only trained and certified interrogators may interrogate; (2) Non-interrogators and non-trained/non-certified interrogators may only ask direct questions, may not use any other approach/technique, and may not \u201cset the conditions\u201d for an interrogation. b. Non-interrogators and non-trained/certified interrogators may provide passively obtained information to trained and certified interrogators for use during interrogations. For example, an MP may tell the interrogator about leaders in the facility, habits of a detainee, groups that have formed in the facility, and other information that the MP has observed during the performance of his/her duties. 4. Need to report abuses. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09, all DoD personnel (including contractors) must report any \u201csuspected or alleged violation of DoD policy, procedures, or applicable law relating to intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings or tactical questioning, for which there is credible information.\u201d b. FM 2-22.3 requires \u201call persons who have knowledge of suspected or alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions are obligated by regulation to report such matters.\u201d c. Reports should be made to the chain of command unless the chain of command is involved, in which case the report should be made to one of the following: SJA, IG, Chaplain, or Provost Marshal. d. Failure to report may be a UCMJ violation (either Article 92, dereliction of duty, or Article 134, misprision of a serious offense). e. Must report violations by anyone, including but not limited to: another interrogator, interpreter, host nation personnel, coalition personnel, or a representative of another government agency (OGA). 5. Know the approved techniques. Only those techniques listed in Chapter 8 of FM 2-22.3 are approved and therefore lawful techniques pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. C. Recent Developments. 1. DoDD 3115.09, Department of Defense Intelligence Interrogations, Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning, 3 November 2005. Under this directive, all captured or detained personnel must be treated humanely. The directive requires all DoD personnel to report any reportable incidents. The use of dogs as a part of an interrogation is prohibited by this directive. The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for establishing training and certification standards for interrogators. 2. Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA of 2005) (part of the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.

Based on enactment of the DTA of 2005, only those approach techniques contained in Chapter 8 and Appendix M of FM 2-22.3 are legal. Unlike most doctrine, this is not a recommendation for how to conduct operations, FM 2-22.3 defines the legal limits of interrogation operations. e.

June 25: Major Action in DC to Demand Prosecution of Torturers Plus, Breaking News: Members of Congress Call for Special Prosecutor! IndictBushNow and a broad number of organizations are coming together for a major action on June 25, 2009 in front of the Justice Department in Washington DC. Yesterday, John Conyers, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and thirteen of his Judiciary colleagues formally appealed to Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. This dramatic action in Congress is a direct result of the pressure generated by you and millions of other people. The letter to the Attorney General reads: \"there can be little doubt that the public interest will be served by appointment of a special counsel. The authorization and use of interrogation techniques that likely amounted to torture has generated tremendous concern and outrage in this country, and has harmed our legal and moral standing in the world.\" More than 400,000 people have signed petitions calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. A coalition of civil rights and human rights organization presented 250,000 petition signatures to the Attorney General last week. More than 150,000 people have signed the petition at IndictBushNow. The people of every country must see that We The People of the United States are uniting to demand accountability for those who committed great crimes in our name. The crimes are too great to let pass. Secret prisons, extraordinary renditions and torture, massive spying on the people of the United States and waging an unprovoked war of aggression on Iraq based on lies and deceit. People are coming to Washington DC on June 25 from all over the country to say loud and clear: No One Is Above the Law! Please organize a June 25 IndictBushNow committee in your local area to bring people to Washington DC or, if you are to far away, organize a local June 25th action at the Federal Building or in another central location in your city or town. Posters, leaflets and logistics information for June 25 will be available in the coming days.",

What Bush did in the name of the American people under the pretense of terrorism is unacceptable and will be dealt with as people wake up. June 25: Major Action in DC to Demand Prosecution of Torturers Plus, Breaking News: Members of Congress Call for Special Prosecutor! IndictBushNow and a broad number of organizations are coming together for a major action on June 25, 2009 in front of the Justice Department in Washington DC. Yesterday, John Conyers, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and thirteen of his Judiciary colleagues formally appealed to Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. This dramatic action in Congress is a direct result of the pressure generated by you and millions of other people. The letter to the Attorney General reads: \"there can be little doubt that the public interest will be served by appointment of a special counsel. The authorization and use of interrogation techniques that likely amounted to torture has generated tremendous concern and outrage in this country, and has harmed our legal and moral standing in the world.\" More than 400,000 people have signed petitions calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. A coalition of civil rights and human rights organization presented 250,000 petition signatures to the Attorney General last week. More than 150,000 people have signed the petition at IndictBushNow. The people of every country must see that We The People of the United States are uniting to demand accountability for those who committed great crimes in our name. The crimes are too great to let pass. Secret prisons, extraordinary renditions and torture, massive spying on the people of the United States and waging an unprovoked war of aggression on Iraq based on lies and deceit. People are coming to Washington DC on June 25 from all over the country to say loud and clear: No One Is Above the Law! Please organize a June 25 IndictBushNow committee in your local area to bring people to Washington DC or, if you are to far away, organize a local June 25th action at the Federal Building or in another central location in your city or town. Posters, leaflets and logistics information for June 25 will be available in the coming days.",

Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military.

Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military.

        "content": "Interrogator training provides interrogators with the basic standards for interrogations in detainee operations. This is the \u201cTHINK\u201d model: 1. Treat all detainees with the same standard. a. DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, 9 May 2006: DoD personnel will \u201ccomply with the Law of War during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.\u201d b. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006: \u201cAll detainees shall be treated humanely, and in accordance with U.S. Law, the Law of War, and applicable U.S. policy.\u201d c. From an interrogator\u2019s perspective, status may matter in the following situations: (1) Use of the separation approach technique: only authorized for unlawful enemy combatants;and (2) Use of the incentives: may not deny the detainee anything entitled by law (there is a difference in entitlements between a civilian internee, lawful enemy combatant, an unlawful enemy combatant, and a retained person). 2. Humane treatment is the standard. Enclosure 4 of DoDD 2310.01E is called the detainee treatment policy. It provides the minimum standards of humane treatment for all detainees and applies to detainees from the point of capture on. a. Adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; b. Free exercise of religion, consistent with the requirements for detention; c. All detainees will be respected as human beings. They will be protected against threats or acts of violence including rape, forced prostitution, assault, theft, public curiosity, bodily injury, and reprisals. They will not be subjected to medical or scientific experiments. They will not be subjected to sensory deprivation. This list is not exclusive. 3. Interrogators interrogate. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09: (1) Only trained and certified interrogators may interrogate; (2) Non-interrogators and non-trained/non-certified interrogators may only ask direct questions, may not use any other approach/technique, and may not \u201cset the conditions\u201d for an interrogation. b. Non-interrogators and non-trained/certified interrogators may provide passively obtained information to trained and certified interrogators for use during interrogations. For example, an MP may tell the interrogator about leaders in the facility, habits of a detainee, groups that have formed in the facility, and other information that the MP has observed during the performance of his/her duties. 4. Need to report abuses. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09, all DoD personnel (including contractors) must report any \u201csuspected or alleged violation of DoD policy, procedures, or applicable law relating to intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings or tactical questioning, for which there is credible information.\u201d b. FM 2-22.3 requires \u201call persons who have knowledge of suspected or alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions are obligated by regulation to report such matters.\u201d c. Reports should be made to the chain of command unless the chain of command is involved, in which case the report should be made to one of the following: SJA, IG, Chaplain, or Provost Marshal. d. Failure to report may be a UCMJ violation (either Article 92, dereliction of duty, or Article 134, misprision of a serious offense). e. Must report violations by anyone, including but not limited to: another interrogator, interpreter, host nation personnel, coalition personnel, or a representative of another government agency (OGA). 5. Know the approved techniques. Only those techniques listed in Chapter 8 of FM 2-22.3 are approved and therefore lawful techniques pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. C. Recent Developments. 1. DoDD 3115.09, Department of Defense Intelligence Interrogations, Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning, 3 November 2005. Under this directive, all captured or detained personnel must be treated humanely. The directive requires all DoD personnel to report any reportable incidents. The use of dogs as a part of an interrogation is prohibited by this directive. The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for establishing training and certification standards for interrogators. 2. Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA of 2005) (part of the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.

Based on enactment of the DTA of 2005, only those approach techniques contained in Chapter 8 and Appendix M of FM 2-22.3 are legal. Unlike most doctrine, this is not a recommendation for how to conduct operations, FM 2-22.3 defines the legal limits of interrogation operations. e.

The letter to the Attorney General reads: \"there can be little doubt that the public interest will be served by appointment of a special counsel. The authorization and use of interrogation techniques that likely amounted to torture has generated tremendous concern and outrage in this country, and has harmed our legal and moral standing in the world.\" More than 400,000 people have signed petitions calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a Special Prosecutor. A coalition of civil rights and human rights organization presented 250,000 petition signatures to the Attorney General last week. More than 150,000 people have signed the petition at IndictBushNow. The people of every country must see that We The People of the United States are uniting to demand accountability for those who committed great crimes in our name. The crimes are too great to let pass. Secret prisons, extraordinary renditions and torture, massive spying on the people of the United States and waging an unprovoked war of aggression on Iraq based on lies and deceit. People are coming to Washington DC on June 25 from all over the country to say loud and clear: No One Is Above the Law! Please organize a June 25 IndictBushNow committee in your local area to bring people to Washington DC or, if you are to far away, organize a local June 25th action at the Federal Building or in another central location in your city or town. Posters, leaflets and logistics information for June 25 will be available in the coming days.",

        "content": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course.

        "reply": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son.

        "content": "Interrogator training provides interrogators with the basic standards for interrogations in detainee operations. This is the \u201cTHINK\u201d model: 1. Treat all detainees with the same standard. a. DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, 9 May 2006: DoD personnel will \u201ccomply with the Law of War during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.\u201d b. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006: \u201cAll detainees shall be treated humanely, and in accordance with U.S. Law, the Law of War, and applicable U.S. policy.\u201d c. From an interrogator\u2019s perspective, status may matter in the following situations: (1) Use of the separation approach technique: only authorized for unlawful enemy combatants;and (2) Use of the incentives: may not deny the detainee anything entitled by law (there is a difference in entitlements between a civilian internee, lawful enemy combatant, an unlawful enemy combatant, and a retained person). 2. Humane treatment is the standard. Enclosure 4 of DoDD 2310.01E is called the detainee treatment policy. It provides the minimum standards of humane treatment for all detainees and applies to detainees from the point of capture on. a. Adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; b. Free exercise of religion, consistent with the requirements for detention; c. All detainees will be respected as human beings. They will be protected against threats or acts of violence including rape, forced prostitution, assault, theft, public curiosity, bodily injury, and reprisals. They will not be subjected to medical or scientific experiments. They will not be subjected to sensory deprivation. This list is not exclusive. 3. Interrogators interrogate. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09: (1) Only trained and certified interrogators may interrogate; (2) Non-interrogators and non-trained/non-certified interrogators may only ask direct questions, may not use any other approach/technique, and may not \u201cset the conditions\u201d for an interrogation. b. Non-interrogators and non-trained/certified interrogators may provide passively obtained information to trained and certified interrogators for use during interrogations. For example, an MP may tell the interrogator about leaders in the facility, habits of a detainee, groups that have formed in the facility, and other information that the MP has observed during the performance of his/her duties. 4. Need to report abuses. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09, all DoD personnel (including contractors) must report any \u201csuspected or alleged violation of DoD policy, procedures, or applicable law relating to intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings or tactical questioning, for which there is credible information.\u201d b. FM 2-22.3 requires \u201call persons who have knowledge of suspected or alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions are obligated by regulation to report such matters.\u201d c. Reports should be made to the chain of command unless the chain of command is involved, in which case the report should be made to one of the following: SJA, IG, Chaplain, or Provost Marshal. d. Failure to report may be a UCMJ violation (either Article 92, dereliction of duty, or Article 134, misprision of a serious offense). e. Must report violations by anyone, including but not limited to: another interrogator, interpreter, host nation personnel, coalition personnel, or a representative of another government agency (OGA). 5. Know the approved techniques. Only those techniques listed in Chapter 8 of FM 2-22.3 are approved and therefore lawful techniques pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. C. Recent Developments. 1. DoDD 3115.09, Department of Defense Intelligence Interrogations, Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning, 3 November 2005. Under this directive, all captured or detained personnel must be treated humanely. The directive requires all DoD personnel to report any reportable incidents. The use of dogs as a part of an interrogation is prohibited by this directive. The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for establishing training and certification standards for interrogators. 2. Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA of 2005) (part of the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.

Based on enactment of the DTA of 2005, only those approach techniques contained in Chapter 8 and Appendix M of FM 2-22.3 are legal. Unlike most doctrine, this is not a recommendation for how to conduct operations, FM 2-22.3 defines the legal limits of interrogation operations. e.

        "content": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son. But in the end we averted World War III with three Middle East countries and kept America safe from a suitcase bomb. \u201cIn 2004, we thwarted the spread of a deadly weaponized virus strain. The following year, after some unsuccessful attempts at sensory disorientation with detainees, we got a torture specialist who had a way with a taser and his trusty syringe. Strict measures, like breaking fingers one by one and using an electrical cord from a lamp to shock a suspect, were necessary.

        "reply": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son. But in the end we averted World War III with three Middle East countries and kept America safe from a suitcase bomb. \u201cIn 2004, we thwarted the spread of a deadly weaponized virus strain. The following year, after some unsuccessful attempts at sensory disorientation with detainees, we got a torture specialist who had a way with a taser and his trusty syringe. Strict measures, like breaking fingers one by one and using an electrical cord from a lamp to shock a suspect, were necessary. We were under attack by a terrorist named Habib Marwan who controlled a bunch of Middle East terrorist cells. They were planning to meltdown nuclear power plants across the country, shoot down Air Force One and set off a nuclear missile. On top of that, we were dealing with a mole in our counterterrorism unit. \u201cIn 2006, after an incident with the man who made history by becoming the first black president ...\u201d Senator Feinstein interrupted: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Cheney, are you talking about Barack Obama?\u201d \u201cI said the first black president,\u201d Cheney snapped, before continuing: \u201cOur interrogator needed to do some things outside protocol.

        "content": "Interrogator training provides interrogators with the basic standards for interrogations in detainee operations. This is the \u201cTHINK\u201d model: 1. Treat all detainees with the same standard. a. DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, 9 May 2006: DoD personnel will \u201ccomply with the Law of War during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.\u201d b. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006: \u201cAll detainees shall be treated humanely, and in accordance with U.S. Law, the Law of War, and applicable U.S. policy.\u201d c. From an interrogator\u2019s perspective, status may matter in the following situations: (1) Use of the separation approach technique: only authorized for unlawful enemy combatants;and (2) Use of the incentives: may not deny the detainee anything entitled by law (there is a difference in entitlements between a civilian internee, lawful enemy combatant, an unlawful enemy combatant, and a retained person). 2. Humane treatment is the standard. Enclosure 4 of DoDD 2310.01E is called the detainee treatment policy. It provides the minimum standards of humane treatment for all detainees and applies to detainees from the point of capture on. a. Adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; b. Free exercise of religion, consistent with the requirements for detention; c. All detainees will be respected as human beings. They will be protected against threats or acts of violence including rape, forced prostitution, assault, theft, public curiosity, bodily injury, and reprisals. They will not be subjected to medical or scientific experiments. They will not be subjected to sensory deprivation. This list is not exclusive. 3. Interrogators interrogate. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09: (1) Only trained and certified interrogators may interrogate; (2) Non-interrogators and non-trained/non-certified interrogators may only ask direct questions, may not use any other approach/technique, and may not \u201cset the conditions\u201d for an interrogation. b. Non-interrogators and non-trained/certified interrogators may provide passively obtained information to trained and certified interrogators for use during interrogations. For example, an MP may tell the interrogator about leaders in the facility, habits of a detainee, groups that have formed in the facility, and other information that the MP has observed during the performance of his/her duties. 4. Need to report abuses. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09, all DoD personnel (including contractors) must report any \u201csuspected or alleged violation of DoD policy, procedures, or applicable law relating to intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings or tactical questioning, for which there is credible information.\u201d b. FM 2-22.3 requires \u201call persons who have knowledge of suspected or alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions are obligated by regulation to report such matters.\u201d c. Reports should be made to the chain of command unless the chain of command is involved, in which case the report should be made to one of the following: SJA, IG, Chaplain, or Provost Marshal. d. Failure to report may be a UCMJ violation (either Article 92, dereliction of duty, or Article 134, misprision of a serious offense). e. Must report violations by anyone, including but not limited to: another interrogator, interpreter, host nation personnel, coalition personnel, or a representative of another government agency (OGA). 5. Know the approved techniques. Only those techniques listed in Chapter 8 of FM 2-22.3 are approved and therefore lawful techniques pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. C. Recent Developments. 1. DoDD 3115.09, Department of Defense Intelligence Interrogations, Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning, 3 November 2005. Under this directive, all captured or detained personnel must be treated humanely. The directive requires all DoD personnel to report any reportable incidents. The use of dogs as a part of an interrogation is prohibited by this directive. The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for establishing training and certification standards for interrogators. 2. Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA of 2005) (part of the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.

Based on enactment of the DTA of 2005, only those approach techniques contained in Chapter 8 and Appendix M of FM 2-22.3 are legal. Unlike most doctrine, this is not a recommendation for how to conduct operations, FM 2-22.3 defines the legal limits of interrogation operations. e.

        "content": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son. But in the end we averted World War III with three Middle East countries and kept America safe from a suitcase bomb. \u201cIn 2004, we thwarted the spread of a deadly weaponized virus strain. The following year, after some unsuccessful attempts at sensory disorientation with detainees, we got a torture specialist who had a way with a taser and his trusty syringe. Strict measures, like breaking fingers one by one and using an electrical cord from a lamp to shock a suspect, were necessary. We were under attack by a terrorist named Habib Marwan who controlled a bunch of Middle East terrorist cells. They were planning to meltdown nuclear power plants across the country, shoot down Air Force One and set off a nuclear missile. On top of that, we were dealing with a mole in our counterterrorism unit. \u201cIn 2006, after an incident with the man who made history by becoming the first black president ...\u201d Senator Feinstein interrupted: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Cheney, are you talking about Barack Obama?\u201d \u201cI said the first black president,\u201d Cheney snapped, before continuing: \u201cOur interrogator needed to do some things outside protocol.

        "reply": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son. But in the end we averted World War III with three Middle East countries and kept America safe from a suitcase bomb. \u201cIn 2004, we thwarted the spread of a deadly weaponized virus strain. The following year, after some unsuccessful attempts at sensory disorientation with detainees, we got a torture specialist who had a way with a taser and his trusty syringe. Strict measures, like breaking fingers one by one and using an electrical cord from a lamp to shock a suspect, were necessary. We were under attack by a terrorist named Habib Marwan who controlled a bunch of Middle East terrorist cells. They were planning to meltdown nuclear power plants across the country, shoot down Air Force One and set off a nuclear missile. On top of that, we were dealing with a mole in our counterterrorism unit. \u201cIn 2006, after an incident with the man who made history by becoming the first black president ...\u201d Senator Feinstein interrupted: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Cheney, are you talking about Barack Obama?\u201d \u201cI said the first black president,\u201d Cheney snapped, before continuing: \u201cOur interrogator needed to do some things outside protocol. There was an exploding vest, a foot digging into a wound, an injection of pain-inducing hyoscine-pentothal, a threat to cut out the eyes of a suspect being interrogated unless he confessed where the Sentox nerve gas cannisters were. But the Geneva Conventions are a small thing to give up when you consider that we broke up a nefarious plot that reached to the highest levels \u2014 the Oval Office.\u201d Senator Olympia Snowe looked confused: \u201cBut you were in the Oval Office in 2006, Mr. Cheney.\u201d Something dawned on Evan Bayh and he smiled grimly. \u201cDidn\u2019t it turn out in the end, Dick,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat some of these so-called terrorist plots were really domestic villains with black ops teams scheming to control the oil supply and get rich?

        "content": "Interrogator training provides interrogators with the basic standards for interrogations in detainee operations. This is the \u201cTHINK\u201d model: 1. Treat all detainees with the same standard. a. DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, 9 May 2006: DoD personnel will \u201ccomply with the Law of War during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.\u201d b. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006: \u201cAll detainees shall be treated humanely, and in accordance with U.S. Law, the Law of War, and applicable U.S. policy.\u201d c. From an interrogator\u2019s perspective, status may matter in the following situations: (1) Use of the separation approach technique: only authorized for unlawful enemy combatants;and (2) Use of the incentives: may not deny the detainee anything entitled by law (there is a difference in entitlements between a civilian internee, lawful enemy combatant, an unlawful enemy combatant, and a retained person). 2. Humane treatment is the standard. Enclosure 4 of DoDD 2310.01E is called the detainee treatment policy. It provides the minimum standards of humane treatment for all detainees and applies to detainees from the point of capture on. a. Adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; b. Free exercise of religion, consistent with the requirements for detention; c. All detainees will be respected as human beings. They will be protected against threats or acts of violence including rape, forced prostitution, assault, theft, public curiosity, bodily injury, and reprisals. They will not be subjected to medical or scientific experiments. They will not be subjected to sensory deprivation. This list is not exclusive. 3. Interrogators interrogate. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09: (1) Only trained and certified interrogators may interrogate; (2) Non-interrogators and non-trained/non-certified interrogators may only ask direct questions, may not use any other approach/technique, and may not \u201cset the conditions\u201d for an interrogation. b. Non-interrogators and non-trained/certified interrogators may provide passively obtained information to trained and certified interrogators for use during interrogations. For example, an MP may tell the interrogator about leaders in the facility, habits of a detainee, groups that have formed in the facility, and other information that the MP has observed during the performance of his/her duties. 4. Need to report abuses. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09, all DoD personnel (including contractors) must report any \u201csuspected or alleged violation of DoD policy, procedures, or applicable law relating to intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings or tactical questioning, for which there is credible information.\u201d b. FM 2-22.3 requires \u201call persons who have knowledge of suspected or alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions are obligated by regulation to report such matters.\u201d c. Reports should be made to the chain of command unless the chain of command is involved, in which case the report should be made to one of the following: SJA, IG, Chaplain, or Provost Marshal. d. Failure to report may be a UCMJ violation (either Article 92, dereliction of duty, or Article 134, misprision of a serious offense). e. Must report violations by anyone, including but not limited to: another interrogator, interpreter, host nation personnel, coalition personnel, or a representative of another government agency (OGA). 5. Know the approved techniques. Only those techniques listed in Chapter 8 of FM 2-22.3 are approved and therefore lawful techniques pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. C. Recent Developments. 1. DoDD 3115.09, Department of Defense Intelligence Interrogations, Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning, 3 November 2005. Under this directive, all captured or detained personnel must be treated humanely. The directive requires all DoD personnel to report any reportable incidents. The use of dogs as a part of an interrogation is prohibited by this directive. The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for establishing training and certification standards for interrogators. 2. Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA of 2005) (part of the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub. Law No. 109-163). a. \u00a7 1002(a): No person in the custody or under the effective control of the Department of Defense or under detention in a Department of Defense facility shall be subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. b. \u00a7 1003(a): No individual in the custody or under the physical control of the United States Government, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. c. \u00a7 1005: Includes provisions for status review of detainees outside the U.S. d. Based on enactment of the DTA of 2005, only those approach techniques contained in Chapter 8 and Appendix M of FM 2-22.3 are legal. Unlike most doctrine, this is not a recommendation for how to conduct operations, FM 2-22.3 defines the legal limits of interrogation operations. e.

        "content": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son. But in the end we averted World War III with three Middle East countries and kept America safe from a suitcase bomb. \u201cIn 2004, we thwarted the spread of a deadly weaponized virus strain. The following year, after some unsuccessful attempts at sensory disorientation with detainees, we got a torture specialist who had a way with a taser and his trusty syringe. Strict measures, like breaking fingers one by one and using an electrical cord from a lamp to shock a suspect, were necessary. We were under attack by a terrorist named Habib Marwan who controlled a bunch of Middle East terrorist cells. They were planning to meltdown nuclear power plants across the country, shoot down Air Force One and set off a nuclear missile. On top of that, we were dealing with a mole in our counterterrorism unit. \u201cIn 2006, after an incident with the man who made history by becoming the first black president ...\u201d Senator Feinstein interrupted: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Cheney, are you talking about Barack Obama?\u201d \u201cI said the first black president,\u201d Cheney snapped, before continuing: \u201cOur interrogator needed to do some things outside protocol. There was an exploding vest, a foot digging into a wound, an injection of pain-inducing hyoscine-pentothal, a threat to cut out the eyes of a suspect being interrogated unless he confessed where the Sentox nerve gas cannisters were. But the Geneva Conventions are a small thing to give up when you consider that we broke up a nefarious plot that reached to the highest levels \u2014 the Oval Office.\u201d Senator Olympia Snowe looked confused: \u201cBut you were in the Oval Office in 2006, Mr. Cheney.\u201d Something dawned on Evan Bayh and he smiled grimly. \u201cDidn\u2019t it turn out in the end, Dick,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat some of these so-called terrorist plots were really domestic villains with black ops teams scheming to control the oil supply and get rich?

        "reply": "Sounds like torture to me? Breaking News-Chenny goes crazy-berserk- April 29, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Vice\u2019s Secret Vices By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON In a closed-door session on Tuesday, Dick Cheney testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques of \u201chigh value\u201d detainees. This columnist gained exclusive \u201caccess\u201d to the classified testimony of the \u201cdeeply missed\u201d former vice president. The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein, began by telling Cheney that she was \u201cshocked personally\u201d by what she had learned about the brutality of the way prisoners were treated. \u201cThose insects weren\u2019t even poisonous,\u201d Cheney growled. \u201cFacial slaps? Abdominal slaps? Throwing a naked man into a wall? Kid stuff. Those methods worked. They kept us safe for seven years. Safer than with that delicate Hawaiian orchid in the White House. America is coming across as weak and indecisive. Just when Rummy and I had stomped out that \u2018Blame America First\u2019 flower-child culture, Obama has dragged it back, apologizing profusely all over the world for the country he\u2019s running, canoodling with greasy dictators, kissing up to those weasels in Europe, which is only free today because of our military. Friends and foes alike will be quick to take advantage if they think they\u2019re dealing with a Creamsicle.\u201d Senator John McCain, looking disgusted, began yelling at Cheney, telling him that waterboarding someone 183 times in a month was against the law. \u201cThe Japanese who did that in World War II were tried and hanged,\u201d he sneered. \u201cShut your piehole,\u201d Cheney replied flatly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick of you being an apologist for torture. Why don\u2019t you go join that pantywaist Specter on the other side where you belong?\u201d Senator Russ Feingold got into the fray, asking Cheney sarcastically: \u201cCan you tell us exactly which terrorist plots were foiled by torture?\u201d Cheney offered his mirthless smile. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied. \u201cShortly after 9/11, we disrupted a plot to assassinate a senator, penetrating two terrorist cells and uncovering a Serbian scheme. Our interrogator used a chokehold, threatened to withhold a detainee\u2019s heart medicine, and broke a few laws, but it was well worth it.\u201d Feingold interrupted with thinly veiled contempt: \u201cYou\u2019re telling us now that the Serbs are linked to Al Qaeda?\u201d Cheney nodded. \u201cOf course. Then, the following year, we were able to get a lead on an international terrorist named Syed Ali and stop a nuclear bomb from being detonated in Los Angeles. Sure, an enemy combatant was shot in the chest. Yes, a hacksaw came into play. There was some wall slamming, throat grabbing and when Ali wouldn\u2019t talk because he was doing \u2018Allah\u2019s work,\u2019 our agent had to feign the shooting death of Ali\u2019s first-born son. But in the end we averted World War III with three Middle East countries and kept America safe from a suitcase bomb. \u201cIn 2004, we thwarted the spread of a deadly weaponized virus strain. The following year, after some unsuccessful attempts at sensory disorientation with detainees, we got a torture specialist who had a way with a taser and his trusty syringe. Strict measures, like breaking fingers one by one and using an electrical cord from a lamp to shock a suspect, were necessary. We were under attack by a terrorist named Habib Marwan who controlled a bunch of Middle East terrorist cells. They were planning to meltdown nuclear power plants across the country, shoot down Air Force One and set off a nuclear missile. On top of that, we were dealing with a mole in our counterterrorism unit. \u201cIn 2006, after an incident with the man who made history by becoming the first black president ...\u201d Senator Feinstein interrupted: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Cheney, are you talking about Barack Obama?\u201d \u201cI said the first black president,\u201d Cheney snapped, before continuing: \u201cOur interrogator needed to do some things outside protocol. There was an exploding vest, a foot digging into a wound, an injection of pain-inducing hyoscine-pentothal, a threat to cut out the eyes of a suspect being interrogated unless he confessed where the Sentox nerve gas cannisters were. But the Geneva Conventions are a small thing to give up when you consider that we broke up a nefarious plot that reached to the highest levels \u2014 the Oval Office.\u201d Senator Olympia Snowe looked confused: \u201cBut you were in the Oval Office in 2006, Mr. Cheney.\u201d Something dawned on Evan Bayh and he smiled grimly. \u201cDidn\u2019t it turn out in the end, Dick,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat some of these so-called terrorist plots were really domestic villains with black ops teams scheming to control the oil supply and get rich? Sort of like what you did with Iraq and Halliburton?\u201d Cheney glared at him, saying \u201cWe\u2019re the patriots.\u201d Bayh walked over and whispered something to the chairwoman. \u201cMr. Cheney,\u201d Feinstein said, sounding shocked, \u201cyour testimony is delusional, not to mention derivative.\u201d Cheney looked apoplectic, not to mention apocalyptic. \u201cHow dare you,\u201d he cried, \u201cdemean our country\u2019s finest counterterrorism agent, Jack Bauer?\u201d HellFired Up | 04.30.09 - 10:36 am | #",

        "content": "Interrogator training provides interrogators with the basic standards for interrogations in detainee operations. This is the \u201cTHINK\u201d model: 1. Treat all detainees with the same standard. a. DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, 9 May 2006: DoD personnel will \u201ccomply with the Law of War during all armed conflicts, however such conflicts are characterized, and in all other military operations.\u201d b. DoDD 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program, 5 September 2006: \u201cAll detainees shall be treated humanely, and in accordance with U.S. Law, the Law of War, and applicable U.S. policy.\u201d c. From an interrogator\u2019s perspective, status may matter in the following situations: (1) Use of the separation approach technique: only authorized for unlawful enemy combatants;and (2) Use of the incentives: may not deny the detainee anything entitled by law (there is a difference in entitlements between a civilian internee, lawful enemy combatant, an unlawful enemy combatant, and a retained person). 2. Humane treatment is the standard. Enclosure 4 of DoDD 2310.01E is called the detainee treatment policy. It provides the minimum standards of humane treatment for all detainees and applies to detainees from the point of capture on. a. Adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; b. Free exercise of religion, consistent with the requirements for detention; c. All detainees will be respected as human beings. They will be protected against threats or acts of violence including rape, forced prostitution, assault, theft, public curiosity, bodily injury, and reprisals. They will not be subjected to medical or scientific experiments. They will not be subjected to sensory deprivation. This list is not exclusive. 3. Interrogators interrogate. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09: (1) Only trained and certified interrogators may interrogate; (2) Non-interrogators and non-trained/non-certified interrogators may only ask direct questions, may not use any other approach/technique, and may not \u201cset the conditions\u201d for an interrogation. b. Non-interrogators and non-trained/certified interrogators may provide passively obtained information to trained and certified interrogators for use during interrogations. For example, an MP may tell the interrogator about leaders in the facility, habits of a detainee, groups that have formed in the facility, and other information that the MP has observed during the performance of his/her duties. 4. Need to report abuses. a. Pursuant to DoDD 3115.09, all DoD personnel (including contractors) must report any \u201csuspected or alleged violation of DoD policy, procedures, or applicable law relating to intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings or tactical questioning, for which there is credible information.\u201d b. FM 2-22.3 requires \u201call persons who have knowledge of suspected or alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions are obligated by regulation to report such matters.\u201d c. Reports should be made to the chain of command unless the chain of command is involved, in which case the report should be made to one of the following: SJA, IG, Chaplain, or Provost Marshal. d. Failure to report may be a UCMJ violation (either Article 92, dereliction of duty, or Article 134, misprision of a serious offense). e. Must report violations by anyone, including but not limited to: another interrogator, interpreter, host nation personnel, coalition personnel, or a representative of another government agency (OGA). 5. Know the approved techniques. Only those techniques listed in Chapter 8 of FM 2-22.3 are approved and therefore lawful techniques pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. C. Recent Developments. 1. DoDD 3115.09, Department of Defense Intelligence Interrogations, Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning, 3 November 2005. Under this directive, all captured or detained personnel must be treated humanely. The directive requires all DoD personnel to report any reportable incidents. The use of dogs as a part of an interrogation is prohibited by this directive. The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for establishing training and certification standards for interrogators. 2. Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA of 2005) (part of the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub. Law No. 109-163). a. \u00a7 1002(a): No person in the custody or under the effective control of the Department of Defense or under detention in a Department of Defense facility shall be subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. b. \u00a7 1003(a): No individual in the custody or under the physical control of the United States Government, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. c. \u00a7 1005: Includes provisions for status review of detainees outside the U.S. d. Based on enactment of the DTA of 2005, only those approach techniques contained in Chapter 8 and Appendix M of FM 2-22.3 are legal. Unlike most doctrine, this is not a recommendation for how to conduct operations, FM 2-22.3 defines the legal limits of interrogation operations. e.
