While the bill included many positive provisions to help address LGBT issues abroad, one section that was struck from the legislation would have ended the practice of excluding domestic partners of foreign service officers from benefits routinely provided to spouses and children, such as access to emergency evacuation support, training and language classes, health care and regional medical units, employment opportunities, consulate services, and visa and relocation support. Berman said he agreed to remove that section of the bill based on his understanding that both the Obama administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were committed to equalizing treatment for same-sex partners in the very near future. He suggested that declaration might be part of a greater package of policy pronouncements from the White House. \u201cMy expectation with respect to the issues that were originally part of my bill, is that the State Department and the secretary will provide the kinds of benefits that I sought,\u201d he said, adding that he was committed to ending discrimination against gay and lesbian foreign service officers. \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, which I don\u2019t think I am, we still have a ways to go on this bill and we can reverse course.\u201d Berman referenced a quote from Michael Guest, a gay ambassador who finally resigned in 2007 over the State Department\u2019s discriminatory practices, in which Guest said, \u201cUnder current practices, we\u2019re kinder to family pets of foreign service officers than we are to gay partners.\u201d That\u2019s true, Berman said, noting that the country pays for the transportation costs of pets to and from foreign posts and provides evacuation services for pets.
