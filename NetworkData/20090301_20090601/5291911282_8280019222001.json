SirJohnRambo You do indeed have a rounded background. I'll start by commenting on your current job: I know many college graduates that appreciate the value of a day's hard labor. If you enjoy it, keep it up! There is no shame in sweat. As for the military... Serving should never be considered unless you're 100% certain the desire is there. It has more to do with common sense than it does patriotism - you're signing away 8 years of your life to the government; once signed, you either do them all honorably or you'll get a negative-type discharge that will haunt you for the rest of your life. It's not like civilian employment where you can just leave. Anything short of those 8 years served honorably and you're fooked for life, bro. With that said, the military does have a lot of opportunities for a motivated young man such as yourself. They could benefit from your education just as you can benefit from serving. Between the 5 branches, the military employs everything from ditch diggers to politicians. But what does your fiance say about all this? No matter what you do in the military, you will be deployed - be it to another state or another country, in service of peace or war, you go and do where and what the military deems necessary. That needs to be your first discussion after you've decided for yourself. Then you need to visit all 5 recruiters for an initial assessment of what that particular branch needs right now, what they'll offer you, and what they'll require in return (your ASVAB and MEPPS if the final deciding factor). Once you've weighed all of this, if your desire is definitely to serve, then I suggest the following: Come back here with your top choices for each branch. Visit each branch sub-forum and ask, \"Hey, what's life like as _________?\" Someone has done any job you're considering and will give you a BTDT account, rather than relying on the recruiters' touting of what that lifestyle is inclusive of. The guys and gals here are incredibly supportive if you're serious about joining and want to make the best decision possible for yourself. Furthermore, I would suggest to your lady that she also create an account here and visit the spouses in the military area. The wives there can tell her EXACTLY what it is like to be a military spouse so that she too can make an honest assessment. After all this is done, you and your fiance can sit down and discuss your decision to join, the challenges you'll both face, individually as well as a couple, and the jobs you're considering most. Believe me, bro, all this research will be worth it in the end. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

Just remember this; depending on your MOS (Military Occupational Series) will depend on where you are stationed.. some are pretty nice gigs, some are not, gotta take the good with the bad. You most likely will be moving every 2-3 years to someplace. The wife has to be totally committed to the lifestyle as you need to be. It will be hard on her. Many of us here did not choose to make the military a career; many of us have regretted that decision at times. I am one of them but at the same time my civilian years turned out pretty good....... many cannot say the same. What to do in the military? Stay away from the combat arms. I will tell you why. I wanted to be a paratrooper so bad I could taste it. I got my wish and was sent away to a land far, far away...... exciting? Very much so. Glamorous? Not one iota. John Wayne lied. Annnd there are not many openings on the outside for someone who is able to carry heavy loads over long distances and can shoot well. So, my suggestion to you is to chose a MOS that will \"teach\" you something you can use on the outside if you decide to leave the service.. PS. if I had to do it all over again I still would have gone down the path I was given BUT I'd learn to bite my tongue a little better then I did. Good luck Rambo (what a stupid handle ) in your career choices. One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

As far as \"ethical concerns,\" I would have no problem doing what was necessary when the time calls for it, I own guns and I'm a pretty good shot. Laws of War seem like an oxymoron to me. Its a little more complicated. I have problems with people who act before they think. People who expect to be treated better then they treat others. I can take ton of sh** and carry it around with me forever, but I cant take ignorance being forced down my throat. I also grew up near marine bases and alot of ignorance, arrogance, and hostility surrounded my community because of nearby bases. I know boys will be boys but alot of these men would have been better off on a roman battlefield clubbing each other then they did in society. I know there are bad apples everywhere I just wanted to make sure that these people were looked down upon EVEN in the service. As for my soon to be wife she is an Urban and Spacial Planner. She is finishing up her masters in May but right now working on her second internship. First one was in the US working for a city planning department of a town second one is in large planning firm in Germany. It seems to be a field of study that allows some mobility when it comes to employment. Could anyone give me feedback on continuing my education while in a service? I would like to have my masters degree or JD sometime in my life. Is this even feasible? A couple of my colleagues are vets and they have nothing nice to say about the military and how it treats its commitment to education. I'd like to hear other experiences as well. anyway I really appreciate the time you have taken to read my post and I really appreciate every comment and piece of advice you all have shared please continue. The amount of educational opportunities you'll have while in is strictly dependent on your MOS (Military Occupational SPECIALTY, to correct a previous poster) and which branch you're in. Learn this phrase: the needs of the military. For example, I was Infantry. Due to the nature of my job -- the physical demands and the need for a constant state of readiness -- it was next to impossible to attend any schooling while active duty. We simply didn't have enough down time. Technically, I could have gone to school for free for all 4 years I was active duty; feasibly, it wasn't possible. I would have had to request a exception to deployment, which would have isolated me from the men that trusted me. I wouldn't have been able to attend FTX (Field Training eXercise), which would have lowered my state of readiness. I would still have been Infantry, but I'd just be a staff weenie and not an integral part of my unit because of our training regime. Now, compare that to, say, someone in finance. They are always in the rear. They don't deploy to FTX. Their need for mission readiness IS ongoing education. So someone in that MOS could very easily conduct most of their duty day and then be released for college. You would be a full-time soldier and full-time student. In fact, at Ft. Riley, we had more than a few HHC-types (Headquarters and Headquarters Company) who attended college almost all of their duty day, every day. They showed up for PT formation, conducted PT with their element as prescribed for that day (some days it is squad, some days platoon, some days company or above, et al), were released after PT for chow, and then fell out for duty formation, inspection, etc. But after that, while everyone else went to \"work,\" they went to school. They were just gone all day, and they showed up for COB formation (Close Of Business) and then went home. Keep in mind, all the above requires command approval. If the company commander denies your request, you train with the rest of us. In the Infantry, 99.9% of us did the exact same thing as everyone else that day - cleaning weapons, conducting classes, sweeping the motor pool, land navigation, etc and etc. If we were scheduled to roll out for FTX, your butt was going short of a presidential decree. If you couldn't because of school, you were mocked and scorned forever by both your peers and your chain of command. But that is the Infantry and other Combat Arms, eg: Tankers, Field Artillery, Navy Seals, etc. The more essential and demanding your MOS is to front-line operations, the less opportunities you'll have to do \"other\" things, college included. Consider now that you're in finance. You're not going to have to go to the field. Your PT is shorter. Your training is less crucial. Your duty day consists of redundant tasks in an office, making sure that people like me get our money for pulling a trigger. Your chances for command approval to attend school are MUCH higher. The CO may require you to take an afternoon class, demanding that you complete your tasks before, say, lunch formation. If you can do it, ie: don't become a detriment to manpower needs, he or she will probably let you take all the classes you want. But if school is hindering your ability to soldier, he or she will likely yank your slotted time so that guys like me, the working slobs, get paid on time. And all of this is contingent on the relation of your school-to-MOS needs. That is, if you're a nurse attending medical school or an MP getting a CJ degree, you're far more likely to be granted time for school than an Infantry troop would be for culinary classes. The needs of the military - is your schooling likely to help your unit or not? The more likely it is that it will assist you as a soldier in your assigned MOS, the more likely it is that you'll be given blocs of time to pursue it. These days, the military has its own little Internet system that allows you to go to college on your off-duty time; and, once more, off-duty time is proportional to your MOS: Infantry has a LOT less off-duty time than S-3. You are expected to balance the two on your own without any need for command intervention. When I was active duty (1989-1993), we didn't have that system and had to physically attend a brick-and-mortar, traditional military classroom. And because I was Infantry, I managed to eek out 3 credit hours in those 4 years. But it is a whole different ball of wax today. If you're responsible and can attend college without it affecting your ability to soldier, you'll have all KINDS of opportunities to get degree after degree. All paid for by the military. All regionally accredited. There is another option, as well: attend a civilian online school while soldiering. For instance, you can be Infantry, go to Kaplan University Online, and the military will pay for it regardless of your degree choice. But again, it cannot and must not interfere with your duty day. If you soldier properly and keep the minimum GPA, the military will pay for your school 100%. However, here is where it gets a bit tricky: Your chain of command may, at their discretion, shut you down at any time. They can put you TDY (Temporary DutY) for whatever need arises, counsel you with a chit to remove yourself from school because your duties are suffering, or just outright make your life miserable for any reason they so choose. Admittedly, these instances are rare. But if you're not soldiering properly, your chain of command WILL find corrective action for you. I do not support anyone joining just for college, as everyone I knew that did so was a pizz-poor soldier that wanted their pimples popped for them while the rest of us humped their ruck. Please don't do that to your fellow troops, bro. We deserve better. But if you can successfully manage the role of professional soldier AND professional student, then the military has wide-reaching opportunities for you to take advantage of in preparation for a civilian career. And, of course, once again, the technical prowess of your job (MOS) determines the availability you'll be given for education. An Air Force Airman working in finance will have almost unlimited opportunities for school, while the Army Infantry guy will have almost none. This difference is made up in how fast you can be promoted, resulting in how much you're paid - I made E-5 after three years, whereas a finance MOS may wait as many as 9 years for that same rank. The closer to a Combat Arms MOS you are, the faster you're promoted. I have personally seen guys retire as an E-6 (20 years in) because they were REMFs (Rear Echelon Mother F-ers) while it isn't at all unusual for an Infantry soldier to make E-6 in 5 or 6 years. In the end, like everything else in life, opportunity in the military is found where you make it. Forget about the Hollywood imagery that is JAG, CSI or any full-length movie. It's all bunk. No one, here or elsewhere, can articulate to you what soldiering is like, as we do different things - every duty station is different, every perception is different, and the dynamic changes as the chain of command is rotated in and out. You may sign the line and get an MOS/chain of command combination that lets you go to school 10 hours a day, every day. Then again, you may get a combination that is drive-on, ruck-up, hardcore and does everything it can to make you soldier and forget about going to college at all. Needs of the military, my friend. That's why you should never join for college itself. You're not there for you. You're there for the military. You don't stop being YOU, but you do lose a sense of the you that is the priority, ie: you're always second after the needs and wants of your country. My new friend, I just CANNOT emphasize enough the importance of joining for the right reasons - and college ain't it. Yes, that can be a PART of it; but you'll be miserable if you think you're going to find a cake job that pays you, houses you and feeds you just to go to school. It isn't like that. It's a very serious responsibility, and therefore it is a very serious decision. Weigh every option carefully, do your homework (pun fun!) and listen very carefully to those of us that have been there and done that. The recruiter is going to promise you Tiffany cuff links. Your chain of command is going to wring out those hopes within the dream like a wet rag. But if you're there for your nation, you'll find yourself with all kinds of benefits. If you're there for the benefits, you'll find your nation a jealous, needy lover that you'll grow to resent. I hope this helps, and my very best wishes to you! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by sirjohnrambo: Thanks again for the responses. As far as \"ethical concerns,\" I would have no problem doing what was necessary when the time calls for it, I own guns and I'm a pretty good shot. Laws of War seem like an oxymoron to me. Its a little more complicated. I have problems with people who act before they think. People who expect to be treated better then they treat others. I can take ton of sh** and carry it around with me forever, but I cant take ignorance being forced down my throat. I also grew up near marine bases and alot of ignorance, arrogance, and hostility surrounded my community because of nearby bases. I know boys will be boys but alot of these men would have been better off on a roman battlefield clubbing each other then they did in society. I know there are bad apples everywhere I just wanted to make sure that these people were looked down upon EVEN in the service. As for my soon to be wife she is an Urban and Spacial Planner. She is finishing up her masters in May but right now working on her second internship. First one was in the US working for a city planning department of a town second one is in large planning firm in Germany. It seems to be a field of study that allows some mobility when it comes to employment. Could anyone give me feedback on continuing my education while in a service? I would like to have my masters degree or JD sometime in my life. Is this even feasible?

At the time of military school I really excelled at everything, I was the top of my class, played 3 sports, etc. and afterwards I continued to \"coast\" through my education and everything else. I'm also a good dancer, adn make a mean meatloaf. Oh and I'm humble. I'm qualified in many areas. (i'm a licensed broker, tips certified bartender, Tips certified?

And did I mention, humble? I have helped start two businesses one in investing and a production company. I've worked post college work as a producer, photographer, and naturally in a holdings company overseeing the building of 10 chain stores. And I'm really humble, too. I ended up selling everything to work on a film project which the plug was pulled a little early. I'm now broke and kinda confused on what to do. The economy is really hurting me. Dude, certified tips bartenders are making bank right now. and I don't want to get back into the holdings company, i would love to pursue the production company but securing funding for what I want to to has proven to be beyond tough. so I'm kinda in a daze. I do a lot of mushroom hunting as well. I'm contemplating the Navy or law school. I'm still young (24 about to be 25). And done all this befoer 25. Don't be so humble. I miss the confidence and structure the military school had for me. It realized my potential and It made me a better person, I didn't like it so much at the time, but in hindsight it was so good for me. I'm afraid if i go into law i wont be as successful as I would want. I feel the military could give me the structure i need to succeed in any path i choose. I don't want to sound like some clueless brat, Not clueless my friend, just a self-fullfilled pompous azzclown. OH and probably a liar too. I've never had any thing handed to me. Me either, I know I have paid for all my European schooling. I know that nothing comes easy. My father taught me well. I was raised to be an intellectual by my mother, but i find myself preferring the company of everyone but these \"experts.\" instead of taking internships at big companies i prefer working with my hands. still exists to this day. with all the formal education I have I'm working with a contractor installing sewage pipes which i find better then any office job. Well, you're doing a whiz bang job of laying teh sewage here, my friend. I did good in school, I'm not as smart as you of course, but shouldn't that say.\"I did well in school\"? I graduated high school with honors and went to four colleges and graduated in four years. I'm surprised you haven't cured cancer yet. (the product of taking 7 classes a semester). I never had problems pulling good grades in school, even with minimum effort. Is the navy a good choice? Sure, you can tell us what we're doing wrong. Chiefs love that. I would want to serve the minimum I would have to. Exactly, as smart and productive as you are, I wouldn't waste any more time than possible with a stupid little organization like the United States Navy. I would like to further my education as well in the process. Is this asking too much for too little in return? Of course not, actaully all tha tis owed to someone like yourself. I work harder then any person I know when its for something I believe in. Of course if you don't believe in it, I guess we're all screwed,huh? I'm also engaged to be married to my girlfriend of 7 years, You mean, the former lingerie model, with two PHd's? and don't want to be married broke with no direction. Law school is like throwing money into a fire and im worried ive been out of school awhile and cannot get back into the groove right away. it gets even more complicated because my fiancee is a German national, and we are in the process of all the paperwork for visa, greencard... this is complicated because she was planning on moving in with me and getting a job while i was going to law school. If I join the military she will have no way to plan for herself (get a job in a specific city) she'll have to follow me around and in her case would not be able to pursue her dreams of working in her desired field and just be a \"wife\". I hear ya bro. The horrors of 'just being a wife or husband' would totally suck. I mean hey, it's all about you. I dont want to take out loans for lawschool, espically if even I question my ability to succeed at this low point, but its this questioning that didnt exist inside of me at military school. Im going to be honost and say that I've never in my wildest dreams considered the military. only one of my realitives served and that was during WW2. but lately its been all I've been thinking about. Translation, dumbo here, can't find a job, in one of his one million talents, so this is his last straw. I'm proud to be American, but find my opinions vary greatly depending on the issues and many times its in contrary to whats the norm. I find this to be the most \"american\" part of me. But fear it would become a problem in the military, even though I know how to keep my mouth shut But let him near a computer, adn he will drone on for hours. I have dignity and refuse to do something I have ethical concerns against. of all the reading I have done so far I have realized that I can either become enlisted or an officer (if accepted?). Naturally, I would want to become an officer because I am smarter than everyone else. I think I should be an Admiral or a General. ANd I'm humble. of the benefits and such, but at the same time I've read on many forums that even people with degrees are enlisting. any comments advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Best tip I can tell you.....go play in traffic. Thanks for playing This message has been edited. Last edited by: billdawg24, Mon 11 May 2009 09:01 AM",

It realized my potential and It made me a better person, I didn't like it so much at the time, but in hindsight it was so good for me. I'm afraid if i go into law i wont be as successful as I would want. I feel the military could give me the structure i need to succeed in any path i choose. I don't want to sound like some clueless brat, Not clueless my friend, just a self-fullfilled pompous azzclown. OH and probably a liar too. I've never had any thing handed to me. Me either, I know I have paid for all my European schooling. I know that nothing comes easy. My father taught me well. I was raised to be an intellectual by my mother, but i find myself preferring the company of everyone but these \"experts.\" instead of taking internships at big companies i prefer working with my hands. still exists to this day. with all the formal education I have I'm working with a contractor installing sewage pipes which i find better then any office job. Well, you're doing a whiz bang job of laying teh sewage here, my friend. I did good in school, I'm not as smart as you of course, but shouldn't that say.\"I did well in school\"? I graduated high school with honors and went to four colleges and graduated in four years. I'm surprised you haven't cured cancer yet. (the product of taking 7 classes a semester). I never had problems pulling good grades in school, even with minimum effort. Is the navy a good choice? Sure, you can tell us what we're doing wrong. Chiefs love that. I would want to serve the minimum I would have to. Exactly, as smart and productive as you are, I wouldn't waste any more time than possible with a stupid little organization like the United States Navy. I would like to further my education as well in the process. Is this asking too much for too little in return? Of course not, actaully all tha tis owed to someone like yourself. I work harder then any person I know when its for something I believe in. Of course if you don't believe in it, I guess we're all screwed,huh? I'm also engaged to be married to my girlfriend of 7 years, You mean, the former lingerie model, with two PHd's? and don't want to be married broke with no direction. Law school is like throwing money into a fire and im worried ive been out of school awhile and cannot get back into the groove right away. it gets even more complicated because my fiancee is a German national, and we are in the process of all the paperwork for visa, greencard... this is complicated because she was planning on moving in with me and getting a job while i was going to law school. If I join the military she will have no way to plan for herself (get a job in a specific city) she'll have to follow me around and in her case would not be able to pursue her dreams of working in her desired field and just be a \"wife\". I hear ya bro. The horrors of 'just being a wife or husband' would totally suck. I mean hey, it's all about you. I dont want to take out loans for lawschool, espically if even I question my ability to succeed at this low point, but its this questioning that didnt exist inside of me at military school. Im going to be honost and say that I've never in my wildest dreams considered the military. only one of my realitives served and that was during WW2. but lately its been all I've been thinking about. Translation, dumbo here, can't find a job, in one of his one million talents, so this is his last straw. I'm proud to be American, but find my opinions vary greatly depending on the issues and many times its in contrary to whats the norm. I find this to be the most \"american\" part of me. But fear it would become a problem in the military, even though I know how to keep my mouth shut But let him near a computer, adn he will drone on for hours. I have dignity and refuse to do something I have ethical concerns against. of all the reading I have done so far I have realized that I can either become enlisted or an officer (if accepted?). Naturally, I would want to become an officer because I am smarter than everyone else. I think I should be an Admiral or a General. ANd I'm humble. of the benefits and such, but at the same time I've read on many forums that even people with degrees are enlisting. any comments advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.",

If you enjoy it, keep it up! There is no shame in sweat. As for the military... Serving should never be considered unless you're 100% certain the desire is there. It has more to do with common sense than it does patriotism - you're signing away 8 years of your life to the government; once signed, you either do them all honorably or you'll get a negative-type discharge that will haunt you for the rest of your life. It's not like civilian employment where you can just leave. Anything short of those 8 years served honorably and you're fooked for life, bro. With that said, the military does have a lot of opportunities for a motivated young man such as yourself. They could benefit from your education just as you can benefit from serving. Between the 5 branches, the military employs everything from ditch diggers to politicians. But what does your fiance say about all this? No matter what you do in the military, you will be deployed - be it to another state or another country, in service of peace or war, you go and do where and what the military deems necessary.

Once you've weighed all of this, if your desire is definitely to serve, then I suggest the following: Come back here with your top choices for each branch. Visit each branch sub-forum and ask, \"Hey, what's life like as _________?\" Someone has done any job you're considering and will give you a BTDT account, rather than relying on the recruiters' touting of what that lifestyle is inclusive of. The guys and gals here are incredibly supportive if you're serious about joining and want to make the best decision possible for yourself. Furthermore, I would suggest to your lady that she also create an account here and visit the spouses in the military area. The wives there can tell her EXACTLY what it is like to be a military spouse so that she too can make an honest assessment. After all this is done, you and your fiance can sit down and discuss your decision to join, the challenges you'll both face, individually as well as a couple, and the jobs you're considering most. Believe me, bro, all this research will be worth it in the end. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

Just remember this; depending on your MOS (Military Occupational Series) will depend on where you are stationed.. some are pretty nice gigs, some are not, gotta take the good with the bad. You most likely will be moving every 2-3 years to someplace. The wife has to be totally committed to the lifestyle as you need to be. It will be hard on her. Many of us here did not choose to make the military a career; many of us have regretted that decision at times. I am one of them but at the same time my civilian years turned out pretty good....... many cannot say the same. What to do in the military? Stay away from the combat arms. I will tell you why. I wanted to be a paratrooper so bad I could taste it. I got my wish and was sent away to a land far, far away...... exciting? Very much so. Glamorous? Not one iota. John Wayne lied. Annnd there are not many openings on the outside for someone who is able to carry heavy loads over long distances and can shoot well. So, my suggestion to you is to chose a MOS that will \"teach\" you something you can use on the outside if you decide to leave the service.. PS. if I had to do it all over again I still would have gone down the path I was given BUT I'd learn to bite my tongue a little better then I did. Good luck Rambo (what a stupid handle ) in your career choices. One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

Just remember this; depending on your MOS (Military Occupational Series) will depend on where you are stationed.. some are pretty nice gigs, some are not, gotta take the good with the bad. You most likely will be moving every 2-3 years to someplace. The wife has to be totally committed to the lifestyle as you need to be. It will be hard on her. Many of us here did not choose to make the military a career; many of us have regretted that decision at times. I am one of them but at the same time my civilian years turned out pretty good....... many cannot say the same. What to do in the military? Stay away from the combat arms. I will tell you why. I wanted to be a paratrooper so bad I could taste it. I got my wish and was sent away to a land far, far away...... exciting? Very much so. Glamorous? Not one iota. John Wayne lied. Annnd there are not many openings on the outside for someone who is able to carry heavy loads over long distances and can shoot well. So, my suggestion to you is to chose a MOS that will \"teach\" you something you can use on the outside if you decide to leave the service.. PS. if I had to do it all over again I still would have gone down the path I was given BUT I'd learn to bite my tongue a little better then I did. Good luck Rambo (what a stupid handle ) in your career choices. One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

She is finishing up her masters in May but right now working on her second internship. First one was in the US working for a city planning department of a town second one is in large planning firm in Germany. It seems to be a field of study that allows some mobility when it comes to employment. Could anyone give me feedback on continuing my education while in a service? I would like to have my masters degree or JD sometime in my life. Is this even feasible? A couple of my colleagues are vets and they have nothing nice to say about the military and how it treats its commitment to education. I'd like to hear other experiences as well. anyway I really appreciate the time you have taken to read my post and I really appreciate every comment and piece of advice you all have shared please continue. The amount of educational opportunities you'll have while in is strictly dependent on your MOS (Military Occupational SPECIALTY, to correct a previous poster) and which branch you're in. Learn this phrase: the needs of the military. For example, I was Infantry. Due to the nature of my job -- the physical demands and the need for a constant state of readiness -- it was next to impossible to attend any schooling while active duty. We simply didn't have enough down time. Technically, I could have gone to school for free for all 4 years I was active duty; feasibly, it wasn't possible. I would have had to request a exception to deployment, which would have isolated me from the men that trusted me. I wouldn't have been able to attend FTX (Field Training eXercise), which would have lowered my state of readiness. I would still have been Infantry, but I'd just be a staff weenie and not an integral part of my unit because of our training regime. Now, compare that to, say, someone in finance. They are always in the rear. They don't deploy to FTX. Their need for mission readiness IS ongoing education. So someone in that MOS could very easily conduct most of their duty day and then be released for college. You would be a full-time soldier and full-time student. In fact, at Ft. Riley, we had more than a few HHC-types (Headquarters and Headquarters Company) who attended college almost all of their duty day, every day. They showed up for PT formation, conducted PT with their element as prescribed for that day (some days it is squad, some days platoon, some days company or above, et al), were released after PT for chow, and then fell out for duty formation, inspection, etc. But after that, while everyone else went to \"work,\" they went to school. They were just gone all day, and they showed up for COB formation (Close Of Business) and then went home. Keep in mind, all the above requires command approval. If the company commander denies your request, you train with the rest of us. In the Infantry, 99.9% of us did the exact same thing as everyone else that day - cleaning weapons, conducting classes, sweeping the motor pool, land navigation, etc and etc. If we were scheduled to roll out for FTX, your butt was going short of a presidential decree. If you couldn't because of school, you were mocked and scorned forever by both your peers and your chain of command. But that is the Infantry and other Combat Arms, eg: Tankers, Field Artillery, Navy Seals, etc. The more essential and demanding your MOS is to front-line operations, the less opportunities you'll have to do \"other\" things, college included. Consider now that you're in finance. You're not going to have to go to the field. Your PT is shorter. Your training is less crucial. Your duty day consists of redundant tasks in an office, making sure that people like me get our money for pulling a trigger. Your chances for command approval to attend school are MUCH higher. The CO may require you to take an afternoon class, demanding that you complete your tasks before, say, lunch formation. If you can do it, ie: don't become a detriment to manpower needs, he or she will probably let you take all the classes you want. But if school is hindering your ability to soldier, he or she will likely yank your slotted time so that guys like me, the working slobs, get paid on time. And all of this is contingent on the relation of your school-to-MOS needs. That is, if you're a nurse attending medical school or an MP getting a CJ degree, you're far more likely to be granted time for school than an Infantry troop would be for culinary classes. The needs of the military - is your schooling likely to help your unit or not? The more likely it is that it will assist you as a soldier in your assigned MOS, the more likely it is that you'll be given blocs of time to pursue it. These days, the military has its own little Internet system that allows you to go to college on your off-duty time; and, once more, off-duty time is proportional to your MOS: Infantry has a LOT less off-duty time than S-3. You are expected to balance the two on your own without any need for command intervention. When I was active duty (1989-1993), we didn't have that system and had to physically attend a brick-and-mortar, traditional military classroom. And because I was Infantry, I managed to eek out 3 credit hours in those 4 years. But it is a whole different ball of wax today. If you're responsible and can attend college without it affecting your ability to soldier, you'll have all KINDS of opportunities to get degree after degree. All paid for by the military. All regionally accredited. There is another option, as well: attend a civilian online school while soldiering. For instance, you can be Infantry, go to Kaplan University Online, and the military will pay for it regardless of your degree choice. But again, it cannot and must not interfere with your duty day. If you soldier properly and keep the minimum GPA, the military will pay for your school 100%. However, here is where it gets a bit tricky: Your chain of command may, at their discretion, shut you down at any time. They can put you TDY (Temporary DutY) for whatever need arises, counsel you with a chit to remove yourself from school because your duties are suffering, or just outright make your life miserable for any reason they so choose. Admittedly, these instances are rare. But if you're not soldiering properly, your chain of command WILL find corrective action for you. I do not support anyone joining just for college, as everyone I knew that did so was a pizz-poor soldier that wanted their pimples popped for them while the rest of us humped their ruck. Please don't do that to your fellow troops, bro. We deserve better. But if you can successfully manage the role of professional soldier AND professional student, then the military has wide-reaching opportunities for you to take advantage of in preparation for a civilian career. And, of course, once again, the technical prowess of your job (MOS) determines the availability you'll be given for education. An Air Force Airman working in finance will have almost unlimited opportunities for school, while the Army Infantry guy will have almost none. This difference is made up in how fast you can be promoted, resulting in how much you're paid - I made E-5 after three years, whereas a finance MOS may wait as many as 9 years for that same rank. The closer to a Combat Arms MOS you are, the faster you're promoted. I have personally seen guys retire as an E-6 (20 years in) because they were REMFs (Rear Echelon Mother F-ers) while it isn't at all unusual for an Infantry soldier to make E-6 in 5 or 6 years. In the end, like everything else in life, opportunity in the military is found where you make it. Forget about the Hollywood imagery that is JAG, CSI or any full-length movie. It's all bunk. No one, here or elsewhere, can articulate to you what soldiering is like, as we do different things - every duty station is different, every perception is different, and the dynamic changes as the chain of command is rotated in and out. You may sign the line and get an MOS/chain of command combination that lets you go to school 10 hours a day, every day. Then again, you may get a combination that is drive-on, ruck-up, hardcore and does everything it can to make you soldier and forget about going to college at all. Needs of the military, my friend. That's why you should never join for college itself. You're not there for you. You're there for the military. You don't stop being YOU, but you do lose a sense of the you that is the priority, ie: you're always second after the needs and wants of your country. My new friend, I just CANNOT emphasize enough the importance of joining for the right reasons - and college ain't it. Yes, that can be a PART of it; but you'll be miserable if you think you're going to find a cake job that pays you, houses you and feeds you just to go to school. It isn't like that. It's a very serious responsibility, and therefore it is a very serious decision. Weigh every option carefully, do your homework (pun fun!) and listen very carefully to those of us that have been there and done that. The recruiter is going to promise you Tiffany cuff links. Your chain of command is going to wring out those hopes within the dream like a wet rag. But if you're there for your nation, you'll find yourself with all kinds of benefits. If you're there for the benefits, you'll find your nation a jealous, needy lover that you'll grow to resent. I hope this helps, and my very best wishes to you! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

At the time of military school I really excelled at everything, I was the top of my class, played 3 sports, etc. and afterwards I continued to \"coast\" through my education and everything else. I'm also a good dancer, adn make a mean meatloaf. Oh and I'm humble. I'm qualified in many areas. (i'm a licensed broker, tips certified bartender, Tips certified? You're joking, that's like teh special forces of bartending. serve safe certified, I really can't come up with anyhting funnier than what he already wrote here. can operate any piece of industrial machinery, good at woodworking, drove boats as big as 60 feet, can sail, good with mac, windows, and Linux, speak a little German, French, dutch, Spanish, Italian...) And did I mention, humble? I have helped start two businesses one in investing and a production company. I've worked post college work as a producer, photographer, and naturally in a holdings company overseeing the building of 10 chain stores. And I'm really humble, too. I ended up selling everything to work on a film project which the plug was pulled a little early. I'm now broke and kinda confused on what to do. The economy is really hurting me. Dude, certified tips bartenders are making bank right now. and I don't want to get back into the holdings company, i would love to pursue the production company but securing funding for what I want to to has proven to be beyond tough. so I'm kinda in a daze. I do a lot of mushroom hunting as well. I'm contemplating the Navy or law school. I'm still young (24 about to be 25). And done all this befoer 25. Don't be so humble. I miss the confidence and structure the military school had for me. It realized my potential and It made me a better person, I didn't like it so much at the time, but in hindsight it was so good for me. I'm afraid if i go into law i wont be as successful as I would want. I feel the military could give me the structure i need to succeed in any path i choose. I don't want to sound like some clueless brat, Not clueless my friend, just a self-fullfilled pompous azzclown. OH and probably a liar too. I've never had any thing handed to me. Me either, I know I have paid for all my European schooling. I know that nothing comes easy. My father taught me well. I was raised to be an intellectual by my mother, but i find myself preferring the company of everyone but these \"experts.\" instead of taking internships at big companies i prefer working with my hands. still exists to this day. with all the formal education I have I'm working with a contractor installing sewage pipes which i find better then any office job. Well, you're doing a whiz bang job of laying teh sewage here, my friend. I did good in school, I'm not as smart as you of course, but shouldn't that say.\"I did well in school\"? I graduated high school with honors and went to four colleges and graduated in four years. I'm surprised you haven't cured cancer yet. (the product of taking 7 classes a semester). I never had problems pulling good grades in school, even with minimum effort. Is the navy a good choice? Sure, you can tell us what we're doing wrong. Chiefs love that. I would want to serve the minimum I would have to. Exactly, as smart and productive as you are, I wouldn't waste any more time than possible with a stupid little organization like the United States Navy. I would like to further my education as well in the process. Is this asking too much for too little in return? Of course not, actaully all tha tis owed to someone like yourself. I work harder then any person I know when its for something I believe in. Of course if you don't believe in it, I guess we're all screwed,huh? I'm also engaged to be married to my girlfriend of 7 years, You mean, the former lingerie model, with two PHd's? and don't want to be married broke with no direction. Law school is like throwing money into a fire and im worried ive been out of school awhile and cannot get back into the groove right away. it gets even more complicated because my fiancee is a German national, and we are in the process of all the paperwork for visa, greencard... this is complicated because she was planning on moving in with me and getting a job while i was going to law school. If I join the military she will have no way to plan for herself (get a job in a specific city) she'll have to follow me around and in her case would not be able to pursue her dreams of working in her desired field and just be a \"wife\". I hear ya bro. The horrors of 'just being a wife or husband' would totally suck. I mean hey, it's all about you. I dont want to take out loans for lawschool, espically if even I question my ability to succeed at this low point, but its this questioning that didnt exist inside of me at military school. Im going to be honost and say that I've never in my wildest dreams considered the military. only one of my realitives served and that was during WW2. but lately its been all I've been thinking about. Translation, dumbo here, can't find a job, in one of his one million talents, so this is his last straw. I'm proud to be American, but find my opinions vary greatly depending on the issues and many times its in contrary to whats the norm. I find this to be the most \"american\" part of me. But fear it would become a problem in the military, even though I know how to keep my mouth shut But let him near a computer, adn he will drone on for hours. I have dignity and refuse to do something I have ethical concerns against. of all the reading I have done so far I have realized that I can either become enlisted or an officer (if accepted?). Naturally, I would want to become an officer because I am smarter than everyone else. I think I should be an Admiral or a General. ANd I'm humble. of the benefits and such, but at the same time I've read on many forums that even people with degrees are enlisting. any comments advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

As far as \"ethical concerns,\" I would have no problem doing what was necessary when the time calls for it, I own guns and I'm a pretty good shot. Laws of War seem like an oxymoron to me. Its a little more complicated. I have problems with people who act before they think. People who expect to be treated better then they treat others. I can take ton of sh** and carry it around with me forever, but I cant take ignorance being forced down my throat. I also grew up near marine bases and alot of ignorance, arrogance, and hostility surrounded my community because of nearby bases. I know boys will be boys but alot of these men would have been better off on a roman battlefield clubbing each other then they did in society. I know there are bad apples everywhere I just wanted to make sure that these people were looked down upon EVEN in the service. As for my soon to be wife she is an Urban and Spacial Planner. She is finishing up her masters in May but right now working on her second internship. First one was in the US working for a city planning department of a town second one is in large planning firm in Germany. It seems to be a field of study that allows some mobility when it comes to employment. Could anyone give me feedback on continuing my education while in a service? I would like to have my masters degree or JD sometime in my life. Is this even feasible? A couple of my colleagues are vets and they have nothing nice to say about the military and how it treats its commitment to education. I'd like to hear other experiences as well. anyway I really appreciate the time you have taken to read my post and I really appreciate every comment and piece of advice you all have shared please continue. The amount of educational opportunities you'll have while in is strictly dependent on your MOS (Military Occupational SPECIALTY, to correct a previous poster) and which branch you're in. Learn this phrase: the needs of the military. For example, I was Infantry. Due to the nature of my job -- the physical demands and the need for a constant state of readiness -- it was next to impossible to attend any schooling while active duty. We simply didn't have enough down time. Technically, I could have gone to school for free for all 4 years I was active duty; feasibly, it wasn't possible. I would have had to request a exception to deployment, which would have isolated me from the men that trusted me. I wouldn't have been able to attend FTX (Field Training eXercise), which would have lowered my state of readiness. I would still have been Infantry, but I'd just be a staff weenie and not an integral part of my unit because of our training regime. Now, compare that to, say, someone in finance. They are always in the rear. They don't deploy to FTX. Their need for mission readiness IS ongoing education. So someone in that MOS could very easily conduct most of their duty day and then be released for college. You would be a full-time soldier and full-time student. In fact, at Ft. Riley, we had more than a few HHC-types (Headquarters and Headquarters Company) who attended college almost all of their duty day, every day. They showed up for PT formation, conducted PT with their element as prescribed for that day (some days it is squad, some days platoon, some days company or above, et al), were released after PT for chow, and then fell out for duty formation, inspection, etc. But after that, while everyone else went to \"work,\" they went to school. They were just gone all day, and they showed up for COB formation (Close Of Business) and then went home. Keep in mind, all the above requires command approval. If the company commander denies your request, you train with the rest of us. In the Infantry, 99.9% of us did the exact same thing as everyone else that day - cleaning weapons, conducting classes, sweeping the motor pool, land navigation, etc and etc. If we were scheduled to roll out for FTX, your butt was going short of a presidential decree. If you couldn't because of school, you were mocked and scorned forever by both your peers and your chain of command. But that is the Infantry and other Combat Arms, eg: Tankers, Field Artillery, Navy Seals, etc. The more essential and demanding your MOS is to front-line operations, the less opportunities you'll have to do \"other\" things, college included. Consider now that you're in finance. You're not going to have to go to the field. Your PT is shorter. Your training is less crucial. Your duty day consists of redundant tasks in an office, making sure that people like me get our money for pulling a trigger. Your chances for command approval to attend school are MUCH higher. The CO may require you to take an afternoon class, demanding that you complete your tasks before, say, lunch formation. If you can do it, ie: don't become a detriment to manpower needs, he or she will probably let you take all the classes you want. But if school is hindering your ability to soldier, he or she will likely yank your slotted time so that guys like me, the working slobs, get paid on time. And all of this is contingent on the relation of your school-to-MOS needs. That is, if you're a nurse attending medical school or an MP getting a CJ degree, you're far more likely to be granted time for school than an Infantry troop would be for culinary classes. The needs of the military - is your schooling likely to help your unit or not? The more likely it is that it will assist you as a soldier in your assigned MOS, the more likely it is that you'll be given blocs of time to pursue it. These days, the military has its own little Internet system that allows you to go to college on your off-duty time; and, once more, off-duty time is proportional to your MOS: Infantry has a LOT less off-duty time than S-3. You are expected to balance the two on your own without any need for command intervention. When I was active duty (1989-1993), we didn't have that system and had to physically attend a brick-and-mortar, traditional military classroom. And because I was Infantry, I managed to eek out 3 credit hours in those 4 years. But it is a whole different ball of wax today. If you're responsible and can attend college without it affecting your ability to soldier, you'll have all KINDS of opportunities to get degree after degree. All paid for by the military. All regionally accredited. There is another option, as well: attend a civilian online school while soldiering. For instance, you can be Infantry, go to Kaplan University Online, and the military will pay for it regardless of your degree choice. But again, it cannot and must not interfere with your duty day. If you soldier properly and keep the minimum GPA, the military will pay for your school 100%. However, here is where it gets a bit tricky: Your chain of command may, at their discretion, shut you down at any time. They can put you TDY (Temporary DutY) for whatever need arises, counsel you with a chit to remove yourself from school because your duties are suffering, or just outright make your life miserable for any reason they so choose. Admittedly, these instances are rare. But if you're not soldiering properly, your chain of command WILL find corrective action for you. I do not support anyone joining just for college, as everyone I knew that did so was a pizz-poor soldier that wanted their pimples popped for them while the rest of us humped their ruck. Please don't do that to your fellow troops, bro. We deserve better. But if you can successfully manage the role of professional soldier AND professional student, then the military has wide-reaching opportunities for you to take advantage of in preparation for a civilian career. And, of course, once again, the technical prowess of your job (MOS) determines the availability you'll be given for education. An Air Force Airman working in finance will have almost unlimited opportunities for school, while the Army Infantry guy will have almost none. This difference is made up in how fast you can be promoted, resulting in how much you're paid - I made E-5 after three years, whereas a finance MOS may wait as many as 9 years for that same rank. The closer to a Combat Arms MOS you are, the faster you're promoted. I have personally seen guys retire as an E-6 (20 years in) because they were REMFs (Rear Echelon Mother F-ers) while it isn't at all unusual for an Infantry soldier to make E-6 in 5 or 6 years. In the end, like everything else in life, opportunity in the military is found where you make it. Forget about the Hollywood imagery that is JAG, CSI or any full-length movie. It's all bunk. No one, here or elsewhere, can articulate to you what soldiering is like, as we do different things - every duty station is different, every perception is different, and the dynamic changes as the chain of command is rotated in and out. You may sign the line and get an MOS/chain of command combination that lets you go to school 10 hours a day, every day. Then again, you may get a combination that is drive-on, ruck-up, hardcore and does everything it can to make you soldier and forget about going to college at all. Needs of the military, my friend. That's why you should never join for college itself. You're not there for you. You're there for the military. You don't stop being YOU, but you do lose a sense of the you that is the priority, ie: you're always second after the needs and wants of your country. My new friend, I just CANNOT emphasize enough the importance of joining for the right reasons - and college ain't it. Yes, that can be a PART of it; but you'll be miserable if you think you're going to find a cake job that pays you, houses you and feeds you just to go to school. It isn't like that. It's a very serious responsibility, and therefore it is a very serious decision. Weigh every option carefully, do your homework (pun fun!) and listen very carefully to those of us that have been there and done that. The recruiter is going to promise you Tiffany cuff links. Your chain of command is going to wring out those hopes within the dream like a wet rag. But if you're there for your nation, you'll find yourself with all kinds of benefits. If you're there for the benefits, you'll find your nation a jealous, needy lover that you'll grow to resent. I hope this helps, and my very best wishes to you! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by sirjohnrambo: Thanks again for the responses. As far as \"ethical concerns,\" I would have no problem doing what was necessary when the time calls for it, I own guns and I'm a pretty good shot. Laws of War seem like an oxymoron to me. Its a little more complicated. I have problems with people who act before they think. People who expect to be treated better then they treat others. I can take ton of sh** and carry it around with me forever, but I cant take ignorance being forced down my throat. I also grew up near marine bases and alot of ignorance, arrogance, and hostility surrounded my community because of nearby bases. I know boys will be boys but alot of these men would have been better off on a roman battlefield clubbing each other then they did in society. I know there are bad apples everywhere I just wanted to make sure that these people were looked down upon EVEN in the service. As for my soon to be wife she is an Urban and Spacial Planner. She is finishing up her masters in May but right now working on her second internship. First one was in the US working for a city planning department of a town second one is in large planning firm in Germany. It seems to be a field of study that allows some mobility when it comes to employment. Could anyone give me feedback on continuing my education while in a service? I would like to have my masters degree or JD sometime in my life. Is this even feasible? A couple of my colleagues are vets and they have nothing nice to say about the military and how it treats its commitment to education. I'd like to hear other experiences as well. anyway I really appreciate the time you have taken to read my post and I really appreciate every comment and piece of advice you all have shared please continue.", 
        "reply": " The amount of educational opportunities you'll have while in is strictly dependent on your MOS (Military Occupational SPECIALTY, to correct a previous poster) and which branch you're in. Learn this phrase: the needs of the military. For example, I was Infantry. Due to the nature of my job -- the physical demands and the need for a constant state of readiness -- it was next to impossible to attend any schooling while active duty. We simply didn't have enough down time. Technically, I could have gone to school for free for all 4 years I was active duty; feasibly, it wasn't possible. I would have had to request a exception to deployment, which would have isolated me from the men that trusted me. I wouldn't have been able to attend FTX (Field Training eXercise), which would have lowered my state of readiness. I would still have been Infantry, but I'd just be a staff weenie and not an integral part of my unit because of our training regime. Now, compare that to, say, someone in finance. They are always in the rear. They don't deploy to FTX. Their need for mission readiness IS ongoing education. So someone in that MOS could very easily conduct most of their duty day and then be released for college. You would be a full-time soldier and full-time student. In fact, at Ft. Riley, we had more than a few HHC-types (Headquarters and Headquarters Company) who attended college almost all of their duty day, every day. They showed up for PT formation, conducted PT with their element as prescribed for that day (some days it is squad, some days platoon, some days company or above, et al), were released after PT for chow, and then fell out for duty formation, inspection, etc. But after that, while everyone else went to \"work,\" they went to school. They were just gone all day, and they showed up for COB formation (Close Of Business) and then went home. Keep in mind, all the above requires command approval. If the company commander denies your request, you train with the rest of us. In the Infantry, 99.9% of us did the exact same thing as everyone else that day - cleaning weapons, conducting classes, sweeping the motor pool, land navigation, etc and etc. If we were scheduled to roll out for FTX, your butt was going short of a presidential decree. If you couldn't because of school, you were mocked and scorned forever by both your peers and your chain of command. But that is the Infantry and other Combat Arms, eg: Tankers, Field Artillery, Navy Seals, etc. The more essential and demanding your MOS is to front-line operations, the less opportunities you'll have to do \"other\" things, college included. Consider now that you're in finance. You're not going to have to go to the field. Your PT is shorter. Your training is less crucial. Your duty day consists of redundant tasks in an office, making sure that people like me get our money for pulling a trigger. Your chances for command approval to attend school are MUCH higher. The CO may require you to take an afternoon class, demanding that you complete your tasks before, say, lunch formation. If you can do it, ie: don't become a detriment to manpower needs, he or she will probably let you take all the classes you want. But if school is hindering your ability to soldier, he or she will likely yank your slotted time so that guys like me, the working slobs, get paid on time. And all of this is contingent on the relation of your school-to-MOS needs. That is, if you're a nurse attending medical school or an MP getting a CJ degree, you're far more likely to be granted time for school than an Infantry troop would be for culinary classes. The needs of the military - is your schooling likely to help your unit or not? The more likely it is that it will assist you as a soldier in your assigned MOS, the more likely it is that you'll be given blocs of time to pursue it. These days, the military has its own little Internet system that allows you to go to college on your off-duty time; and, once more, off-duty time is proportional to your MOS: Infantry has a LOT less off-duty time than S-3. You are expected to balance the two on your own without any need for command intervention. When I was active duty (1989-1993), we didn't have that system and had to physically attend a brick-and-mortar, traditional military classroom. And because I was Infantry, I managed to eek out 3 credit hours in those 4 years. But it is a whole different ball of wax today. If you're responsible and can attend college without it affecting your ability to soldier, you'll have all KINDS of opportunities to get degree after degree. All paid for by the military. All regionally accredited. There is another option, as well: attend a civilian online school while soldiering. For instance, you can be Infantry, go to Kaplan University Online, and the military will pay for it regardless of your degree choice. But again, it cannot and must not interfere with your duty day. If you soldier properly and keep the minimum GPA, the military will pay for your school 100%. However, here is where it gets a bit tricky: Your chain of command may, at their discretion, shut you down at any time. They can put you TDY (Temporary DutY) for whatever need arises, counsel you with a chit to remove yourself from school because your duties are suffering, or just outright make your life miserable for any reason they so choose. Admittedly, these instances are rare. But if you're not soldiering properly, your chain of command WILL find corrective action for you. I do not support anyone joining just for college, as everyone I knew that did so was a pizz-poor soldier that wanted their pimples popped for them while the rest of us humped their ruck. Please don't do that to your fellow troops, bro. We deserve better. But if you can successfully manage the role of professional soldier AND professional student, then the military has wide-reaching opportunities for you to take advantage of in preparation for a civilian career. And, of course, once again, the technical prowess of your job (MOS) determines the availability you'll be given for education. An Air Force Airman working in finance will have almost unlimited opportunities for school, while the Army Infantry guy will have almost none. This difference is made up in how fast you can be promoted, resulting in how much you're paid - I made E-5 after three years, whereas a finance MOS may wait as many as 9 years for that same rank. The closer to a Combat Arms MOS you are, the faster you're promoted. I have personally seen guys retire as an E-6 (20 years in) because they were REMFs (Rear Echelon Mother F-ers) while it isn't at all unusual for an Infantry soldier to make E-6 in 5 or 6 years. In the end, like everything else in life, opportunity in the military is found where you make it. Forget about the Hollywood imagery that is JAG, CSI or any full-length movie. It's all bunk. No one, here or elsewhere, can articulate to you what soldiering is like, as we do different things - every duty station is different, every perception is different, and the dynamic changes as the chain of command is rotated in and out. You may sign the line and get an MOS/chain of command combination that lets you go to school 10 hours a day, every day. Then again, you may get a combination that is drive-on, ruck-up, hardcore and does everything it can to make you soldier and forget about going to college at all. Needs of the military, my friend. That's why you should never join for college itself. You're not there for you. You're there for the military. You don't stop being YOU, but you do lose a sense of the you that is the priority, ie: you're always second after the needs and wants of your country. My new friend, I just CANNOT emphasize enough the importance of joining for the right reasons - and college ain't it.

We see hundreds of young people come on these boards adn do one of several things. a)They brag on themselves and tell us of all therir accomplishments(as you did) b)They let us know how great they would be in the military(as you did) c)They ask questions, without first trying to do some research themselves, showing us that the yare self-starters adn motivated(as you did) d)They come on and show a lack of respect for people who have been there, done that or the military in general(as you did) e) They get a response teh ydon't like and they get all offended and pout(as you did). I for one, don't need your senior thesis on all of your accomplishments over and over. If you want to join the military, great, ask some cogent questions, after first researching yourself, and you will find more help here than you know what to do with. Personally, you have already siad that there's thigns about the military you don't like or won't do, tells me, you're not suited for it. No big deal, not everyone is. But please don't come back here and rationalize your posts or try and tell us we're wrong, when you are here looking for advice. Sometimes we come across harsh. The military and the jobs we do are harsh as is real life, as I'm sure you have already found out, if your story is true. We are generally sarcastic, soem more than others(hell, I wrote the book onit, or at least a couple of how-to chapters), but you can't have thin skin. Good luck with whatver you choose to do.",
