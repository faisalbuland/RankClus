We fixed what we broke, mission over, lets get out. So, you are saying that we went in and got Saddam and instead of staying so we could try to stop all of the murdering terrorists that were running around Iraq, we should have just left them to slaughter and brutalize the innocent citizens of Iraq? Is that what you are saying?",

WEBB: And in my view, these people don\u2018t understand the realities post-9/11. Post-9/11, this was a bad idea. Pre-9/11, I still would have opposed it, but at least it was an arguable idea. MATTHEWS: Because\u2014why is it more of a bad idea now since 9/11? WEBB: Because international terrorism really moved in a dramatic way from a regional problem to a global problem. We saw that we had to step to the forefront. We had all the nations of the world with us after 9/11. And we systematically alienated a huge percentage of the world at a time we needed their cooperation. We tied down our military in static positions when we had developed, for 10 or 15 years, we had worked on a maneuverable military. And now we dumped them into static positions. So it is a bad idea in terms of international politics, a bad idea in terms of grand strategy, and a bad idea in how to use the military. MATTHEWS: Did we dare the Arab world to take us on in Iraq? The young men of the Arab world? Did we say, go ahead, make our day, go ahead, step up to the plate, you got it? WEBB: Clearly, it was the inevitable consequences of anyone who thought this through. MATTHEWS: Like bring it on. That\u2018s what the president said. And they did. WEBB: And well, I think that by putting our people in Iraq, we certainly made them targets in a way that they wouldn\u2018t have been if we were fighting the war against international terrorism from a position to maneuver.\" ------------- Our guys are still dying in Iraq because of criminal negligence by the Bush Administration.
