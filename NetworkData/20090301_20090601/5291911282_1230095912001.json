        "content": "I trying to find anyone who knows how I can send care packages for the working dogs in Iraq. My husband is there and is telling me they are desperate for supplies because the PX doesn't sell stuff for the dogs. Ive got a ton of donations I just need POC's and Address of units that have working dogs that need things. The American Kennel club, Several Dog Show Clubs, Venders, and lots of dog show handlers have made generous donations and will continue to do so until the end of the month. Please let me know how we can get this stuff to the dogs! The donations include things like shampoo, brushes, nail clippers, dog toys, leashes collars, food and anything else that may be needed just let me know they have taken cash donations to purchase stuff also. Thanks! This message has been edited. Last edited by: mainedawg, Wed 01 April 2009 08:33 PM",
