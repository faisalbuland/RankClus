Anyway, because I worked in a Radar Van full of electronics, contacts were tabboo, but I hated them becasue they get dust under them. So I preferred glasses anyway - that corrected my vision to 20/10 - great for Radar Scope work, but also great for observation, hunting, and seeing police cars at 2-3 miles on the freeway!! If your vision is good enough you barely need correction in just one eye, you should have no problem.

It used to be the rule you couldn't wear contacts, because watching an electronic spark like welding or a glitch in electronics might weld them to the surface of your eyeball via electrolysis or something... Anyway, because I worked in a Radar Van full of electronics, contacts were tabboo, but I hated them becasue they get dust under them. So I preferred glasses anyway - that corrected my vision to 20/10 - great for Radar Scope work, but also great for observation, hunting, and seeing police cars at 2-3 miles on the freeway!! If your vision is good enough you barely need correction in just one eye, you should have no problem. When I enlisted, mine was 20/25 and 20/30 - no problem - - Just kept me from being a pilot was all - - Air Force Forums might be a better place to ask - - http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/cfrm/f/65919558 Wandering and Wondering",
