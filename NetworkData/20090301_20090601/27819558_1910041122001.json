To your question, One member was suspended for \"Publicly Calling out a Moderator\", this means we do not question a Mods decisions in the open Forums. If you have a gripe with a Moderators decision, you E-mail the Moderator and make your case. The member who was suspended for this infraction had been warned not to do this again, but he persisted. Another member was suspended because he/she had a prior suspension and had not requested reinstatement. This individual tried creating a new account in order to get around the prior suspension. I don't know if the prior suspension was temporary or permanent in nature. Other rules; Don't call other members derogatory names, Don't try bypassing the word filter, Don't disrespect the military service of other members, Don't use Hot Links that are not approved by this site, Don't spam - as in soliciting for other web sites, etc. These are just a few that come to mind, perhaps others can lend their expertise and help fill in for any that I have missed.

Can someone explain what was meant by that? It gave the appearance that one side of an ongoing debate was being pandered to. Am I wrong about that perception? Yes, you are wrong. If you have a question concerning what a Moderator says or does on these boards, I'd suggest you contact that Moderator by clicking on their name or clicking on the \"Triangle\" of the Moderators post that you wish to question and consult with him/her privately. You've already been made aware of the rule about \"Calling out a Moderator Publicly\", it would behoove you to follow that rule unless your itching to get yourself suspended. It was a moderator???? I was hoping for responses from other people. No, I'd not call anyone out. Just wanted to know what the term meant. How do you know I'm wrong? What does 'chew toy' mean?",

Another member was suspended because he/she had a prior suspension and had not requested reinstatement. This individual tried creating a new account in order to get around the prior suspension. I don't know if the prior suspension was temporary or permanent in nature. Other rules; Don't call other members derogatory names, Don't try bypassing the word filter, Don't disrespect the military service of other members, Don't use Hot Links that are not approved by this site, Don't spam - as in soliciting for other web sites, etc. These are just a few that come to mind, perhaps others can lend their expertise and help fill in for any that I have missed. The Moderators are generally lenient and will give you a warning first, especially if your new here and not familiar with the boundaries.
