As Germany mourned the 15 victims of the attack, officials were able to provide the first indications as to what propelled Tim Kretschmer, a computer game and gun enthusiast, to go on the rampage at the school in Winnenden. Heribert Rech, Interior Minister of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, told a press conference that the father of a teenager from Bavaria had contacted police to tell them about messages left by Kretschmer on a chatroom based in the United States. \"It said something like: 'Everybody is laughing at me. Nobody recognises my potential. I have arms, I have guns, and tomorrow morning I will go to my previous school and show them what I can do,\" Mr Rech said. (...) Dressed in black special forces fatigues, Kretschmer strode into the school at 9.30 am and began firing. He shot dead nine students \u2013 eight of them young girls \u2013 and three female teachers before fleeing as police arrived. Most of the victims were shot cleanly in the head. Mr Rech revealed today that Kretschmer had received treatment last year at a psychiatric clinic in Winnenden, to which he fled after the school spree and where he shot dead a gardener before hijacking a Volkswagen Sharan car. He shot another two people at a nearby town before shooting himself in the head after receiving a leg wound in a shootout with police. It emerged today that a simple codeword broadcast into classrooms at the Albertville school is thought to have saved dozens of lives during Kretschmer's shooting spree. As soon as the shooting started, the principal of the school was able to warn teachers by announcing over the school speaker system: \"Frau Koma kommt\" - or \"Mrs Koma is coming.\" Germans use the word \"Amoklauf\" \u2013 literally \"running amok\" \u2013 to describe school shootings The word \"Koma\" is \"Amok\" written backwards so teachers at the school knew immediately what was meant by the message. \"Our teacher closed the door and said we should close the windows and sit on the floor,\" one student, identified only as Kim S., told ZDF television. Officials said that the codeword system was put in place in 2002 after Germany's worst school shooting, when a student from the eastern city of Erfurt killed 16 people, including 13 teachers, before turning the gun on himself. That tragedy prompted the rewriting of Germany's gun laws, raising the minimum age for gun ownership from 18 to 21. (...) \"He liked computer games like Counter Strike. My friend, who knew him better and went to his house, said he used to have cardboard figures of people with air guns in his cellar. He shot them in the head.\" As police investigate the shooting, prosecutors are looking into whether to press charges against Kretschmer's gun-collecting father, who legally owned 15 firearms. Mr Rech said that 14 of the weapons were held in a gun cupboard, secured by an eight-digit combination lock. One, a Beretta 9mm pistol, was kept in his bedroom, and was stolen by the young gunman along with more than 200 rounds of ammunition. \u201cEverything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned,\u201d said Ralf Michelfelder, a police spokesman. +http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5894847.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1",

As Germany mourned the 15 victims of the attack, officials were able to provide the first indications as to what propelled Tim Kretschmer, a computer game and gun enthusiast, to go on the rampage at the school in Winnenden. Heribert Rech, Interior Minister of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, told a press conference that the father of a teenager from Bavaria had contacted police to tell them about messages left by Kretschmer on a chatroom based in the United States. \"It said something like: 'Everybody is laughing at me. Nobody recognises my potential. I have arms, I have guns, and tomorrow morning I will go to my previous school and show them what I can do,\" Mr Rech said. (...) Dressed in black special forces fatigues, Kretschmer strode into the school at 9.30 am and began firing. He shot dead nine students \u2013 eight of them young girls \u2013 and three female teachers before fleeing as police arrived. Most of the victims were shot cleanly in the head. Mr Rech revealed today that Kretschmer had received treatment last year at a psychiatric clinic in Winnenden, to which he fled after the school spree and where he shot dead a gardener before hijacking a Volkswagen Sharan car. He shot another two people at a nearby town before shooting himself in the head after receiving a leg wound in a shootout with police. It emerged today that a simple codeword broadcast into classrooms at the Albertville school is thought to have saved dozens of lives during Kretschmer's shooting spree. As soon as the shooting started, the principal of the school was able to warn teachers by announcing over the school speaker system: \"Frau Koma kommt\" - or \"Mrs Koma is coming.\" Germans use the word \"Amoklauf\" \u2013 literally \"running amok\" \u2013 to describe school shootings The word \"Koma\" is \"Amok\" written backwards so teachers at the school knew immediately what was meant by the message. \"Our teacher closed the door and said we should close the windows and sit on the floor,\" one student, identified only as Kim S., told ZDF television. Officials said that the codeword system was put in place in 2002 after Germany's worst school shooting, when a student from the eastern city of Erfurt killed 16 people, including 13 teachers, before turning the gun on himself. That tragedy prompted the rewriting of Germany's gun laws, raising the minimum age for gun ownership from 18 to 21. (...) \"He liked computer games like Counter Strike. My friend, who knew him better and went to his house, said he used to have cardboard figures of people with air guns in his cellar. He shot them in the head.\" As police investigate the shooting, prosecutors are looking into whether to press charges against Kretschmer's gun-collecting father, who legally owned 15 firearms. Mr Rech said that 14 of the weapons were held in a gun cupboard, secured by an eight-digit combination lock. One, a Beretta 9mm pistol, was kept in his bedroom, and was stolen by the young gunman along with more than 200 rounds of ammunition. \u201cEverything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned,\u201d said Ralf Michelfelder, a police spokesman. +http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5894847.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1",
