Alexandro Magdaleno and Staff Sgt. James Schneider received the medals for their actions during Operation Enduring Freedom. All are former members of Embedded Training Team 5-3 and endured direct fire while training Afghan National Army units. The three volunteered to mentor Afghan soldiers in various parts of Afghanistan, deploying from October 2007 to December 2008. Many of the training missions were accomplished by fostering good teamwork with the Afghans, said Schneider, a native of Thorndale, Texas, who was fired upon during a September 2008 patrol. During the patrol, Schneider was searching for a Taliban leader near Omar, Afghanistan, in Korengal Valley with Afghan soldiers and a U.S. Army platoon. When small arms fire broke out, his group fired back. Schneider noticed the gunner of his humvee was nearly out of ammunition. Still taking fire, he maneuvered across more than 90 feet of open space to reach the gunner and assisted in reloading the .50-caliber machine gun. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just thinking about making sure the job was done.\u201d More here: http://www.military.com/news/article/marine-corps-news/...anistan-honored.html \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
