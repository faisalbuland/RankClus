After they scored that, they decided to let me keep the first score. Was 7 out 37 and they gave six points for turning in the test. They spent an hour with me, with some basic English question, they couldn\u2019t speak any language, But in 1990 they gave a recall notice because my records said I was fluent in farce (spell) I told them I wasn\u2019t and they told me I still had to report to DA NLT 0900 Monday. So I went to DA, The G7 some major general met us in started stating out what our responsibility would be then he had individual meeting with him. When I showed him my original DD214, he said you really don\u2019t speak farce do you? I told him general I don\u2019t speak English very well. So the army gave me three day pay, travel, lodging and meals. God and the soldier, All men adore, In time of trouble, And no more; For when war is over, And all things righted, God is neglected - The old soldier slighted.

It's on the beach in California, if you're into that sort of thing, though the water is rather cold most of the year. Also, many Chinese speakers get sent to Hawaii, though not all do. You'll do well in Chinese since you have some background in it, but pay attention! Lots of heritage speakers sent to DLI find the first three or four months a repeat of what they already know, so they quit paying attention and end up failing out at the year mark, once the coursework goes past their prior knowledge. You could even retrain into Arabic, but I don't know how high your DLAB score is. That's not such a big deal as long as you're dealing with language you already know, or related ones.
