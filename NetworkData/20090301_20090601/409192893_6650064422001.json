And I agree that the DNC has spent a lot of time tying Rush to the RNC. But I am not aware of anyone with any clout in the Republican Party saying \"Rush does not represent us, does not represent Republican views or opinions.\" Michael Steele tried, and then had to frantically back-pedal. For all the work the Dems have done to make Rush the voice of Republicans, the Repubs have done virtually nothing to refute it. It looks more and more like denying or defying Rush is denying and defying the party. You may want to consider jumping ship - there are other conservative parties out there, most of them much less objectionable right now.",

So why do you listen to him? btw, maybe you havent figured this out, he gets paid to talk hence your verbal diarrhea. Are you amazed at Dems? They are the ones portraying him as the voice of repubs. When the Chairman of the RNC backtracks and apologizes to Rush for saying he isn't the Republican Party, the matter is settled. LMAO, in the mind of a lib. Funny how libs here and in the msm are giving advice to repubs on how to better the party. A party that they dont vote in. Repubs/conservs dont breath on word from the rnc. Do you jump when Dean hollers. In the mind of a Lib? The whole affair of Steele apologizing to Limbaugh is very well documented. The facts are easy to find - and the fact is that Steele backtracked from his statement that Rush was not the leader of the GOP and apologized to Rush for making that comment. FYI, John Dean isn't the head of the DNC - Tim Kaine is. Proves my point. nice try", 
        "reply": " Gunny, if you want to say Rush does not represent conservatives, I'm squarely behind you. And I agree that the DNC has spent a lot of time tying Rush to the RNC. But I am not aware of anyone with any clout in the Republican Party saying \"Rush does not represent us, does not represent Republican views or opinions.\" Michael Steele tried, and then had to frantically back-pedal. For all the work the Dems have done to make Rush the voice of Republicans, the Repubs have done virtually nothing to refute it. It looks more and more like denying or defying Rush is denying and defying the party. You may want to consider jumping ship - there are other conservative parties out there, most of them much less objectionable right now.",

No group is truly homogenous - even clones would disagree. Nonetheless, the purpose of a party is to use the collective strength of shared beliefs. If you do not share the majority of those beliefs, you are in the wrong party. Nonetheless, it seems as though the majority of the Republican Party is giving a tacit acceptance that Rush is a national leader of the party. To what extent do you disagree? Who do you feel better represents your opinions in the party, and what is the strength of their voice?",

(pot meet kettle) And kegler, I agree, it really is interesting to hear that so many liberals listen more to Rush than do some of us who are more conservative..the only time I hear about Rush and what he is saying is when liberals on here rant and rave about it.. and personally, I have no idea WHO Rush leads, sounds like some folks who hate him follow after him more than others..",

No group is truly homogenous - even clones would disagree. Nonetheless, the purpose of a party is to use the collective strength of shared beliefs. If you do not share the majority of those beliefs, you are in the wrong party. Nonetheless, it seems as though the majority of the Republican Party is giving a tacit acceptance that Rush is a national leader of the party. To what extent do you disagree? Who do you feel better represents your opinions in the party, and what is the strength of their voice?",

For all the work the Dems have done to make Rush the voice of Republicans, the Repubs have done virtually nothing to refute it. Personally, I don't listen to people who claim to have clout in either Party..because the ONLY reason ppl assume they have any clout in either party is because others assume they do.. I can't speak for EVERYONE who is a registered Republican any more than Rush speaks for EVERYONE registered to vote Republican.. Anymore than Hillary Clinton, Howard Dean or even Joe Biden speaks for EVERY registered Democrat.. everyone has their own views, and their own opinions on a variety of topics, and they don't always fall lock step with everything these folks say..",

If you do not share the majority of those beliefs, you are in the wrong party.
