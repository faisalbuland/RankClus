If it's a case of more money let the banks bailout the ship builders and Retrofit and recommission some of our ships sitting in bone yards Ummm... The navy ship building program is a mess - for example, the LCS costs doubled (maybe more) during construction (over original estimates). The costs were so out of control that even the navy cancelled half of the original LCS's that were supposed to be built (some believe they might've been better off to buy more FSF-1/SWATH designs instead, as they are considerably less expensive). Note that Senator McCain used LCS cost overruns as an example of waste in his presidential compaign. Another example concerns the original costs of the DDG 1000 Zumwalt-class destroyers vs. the ~$3 Billion each (+) they are now (note: the lifecycle costs are also estimated to exceed over $1B more than was originally specified as well). The original plan was to build 32, then it went down to 24, then 7, and now 3 are all that will be built - primarily because of costs being out of control. One of the additional problems the ship has is that the Navy says that the Zumwalts will lack SM-3 capability, yet part of the reason for creating this ship is because it was considered essential to anti-ballistic missile defense (go figure!!). Now the ship is so expensive (on top of it all), it is suspected by many that the willingness to use it for it for it was originally designed for (land attack) will be reduced because of the reluctance to send such an expensive asset into the littorals. In short - the costs (etc) are so out of control that it has been decided to build more Burke-class ships instead (an excellent, but far less stealthy/older design). And there is the nightmare known as the San Antonio class (LPD-17). While an impressive (overall) design, it is way over cost estimates, extremely late, and legendary for the number of serious problems that turned the project into a SNAFU of notable repute. Ironing out the problems has been a long and arduous task. I'm not suggesting that it won't be a great piece of hardware when it finally gets the problems ironed out - its just that this ship class has had serious problems in a far larger number of respects than it should have. The navy's penchant to not complete the design, yet begin building, effects the ship building process very badly. The contractors then process engineering change orders while the ship is being built, either due to discovered flaws or because of new features/toys/etc that the navy decides they want stuffed in afterwards, is killing the ability of the navy to meet its committments (the contractors also hold part of he blame because of the way they bid, etc. - but that is another story). This isn't to say that congress isn't without its problems - it's got plenty. But it is clear that the navy (and the coast guard's deepwater) ship building programs have major issues (acquisition, specification, designs, process & cost controls, etc.) that must be addressed. Hope this helps... Cheers. This message has been edited. Last edited by: PolicyWonk, Fri 15 May 2009 07:13 AM",
