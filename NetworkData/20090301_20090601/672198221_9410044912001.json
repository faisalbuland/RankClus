Jack - Your logic is flawed, your mathmatic's is non-existant. First the protest, Bush you stated in the last 8 years gave us the bad economic's is dead arse wrong. It started in 1999 with a combination of events. To accept your thoughts you must heap some of your illogical blame on the Senate/House in the same time period. President Obama was in the Senate in 2004. But neither he or Bush were involved. In the previous year 2003 the Secretary of Tresury warned that Freddie and Fannie needed to be reined in. In 2005 S190 of the Shelby committee to regulate lending practies of Fannie, Freddie and banking. By a partisan vote including Senator Dodd the bill was tabled never to see the daylight again. When the Shiite hit the fan in 2007 2008 the language of this bill that finally passed Congress was close to the one previous (S190) by the Senate to regain authority of the lending institutions. The bill in 1999 co-author in the Senate and House relax restriction on credit, diversity in banking, clearing houses, insurance etc. Senator Gramm (R)and House Members Jim Leach (R) were the original authors. It past both Houses and stymied in the joint committee only to be compromised when an insertion of Community Reinvestment was made by Democratic members. President Clinton Signed the bill in December 1999. George Bush has nothing to apologize for nor the members of the Congress of that year. It was in 2003 and 2005 when members were warned, had advance notice given by Secretary of Treasury, HUD, and other agencies without taking action. The one name that appears often than any other is Dodd.",

Jack - Your logic is flawed, your mathmatic's is non-existant. First the protest, Bush you stated in the last 8 years gave us the bad economic's is dead arse wrong. It started in 1999 with a combination of events. To accept your thoughts you must heap some of your illogical blame on the Senate/House in the same time period. President Obama was in the Senate in 2004. But neither he or Bush were involved. In the previous year 2003 the Secretary of Tresury warned that Freddie and Fannie needed to be reined in. In 2005 S190 of the Shelby committee to regulate lending practies of Fannie, Freddie and banking. By a partisan vote including Senator Dodd the bill was tabled never to see the daylight again. When the Shiite hit the fan in 2007 2008 the language of this bill that finally passed Congress was close to the one previous (S190) by the Senate to regain authority of the lending institutions. The bill in 1999 co-author in the Senate and House relax restriction on credit, diversity in banking, clearing houses, insurance etc. Senator Gramm (R)and House Members Jim Leach (R) were the original authors. It past both Houses and stymied in the joint committee only to be compromised when an insertion of Community Reinvestment was made by Democratic members. President Clinton Signed the bill in December 1999. George Bush has nothing to apologize for nor the members of the Congress of that year. It was in 2003 and 2005 when members were warned, had advance notice given by Secretary of Treasury, HUD, and other agencies without taking action.
