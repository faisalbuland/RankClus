Tort reform. Are you sure you really want that? My father-in-law died at university hospital in Dallas, TX. They not only sewed up his surgery for a cancerous bladder with outdated sutures, they also apparently cleared him for activities far too early. The end result is that his sutures burst open and his guts spilled out onto the bed in the presence of my wife, his daughter. When they put his guts back where they were supposed to be, they apparently \"bent\" them and they quickly grew into the abdominal lining, shutting off his intestines. He died within a few weeks because his intestines did not work below the surgery site. How much is enough for that? In Texas, where this happened, we've got \"tort reform\" which limits a doctor or hospital's liabilty to $100,000 for malpractice. His total hospital bill came to just over $300,000. My mother-in-law, his bride of over 50 years, was not aware of all this and we, the family, did not tell her. Consequently, there was no lawsuit. She was virtually comotose with grief anyhow. So..you tell me. Had we sued, would $100,000 been enough for her pain?",

If the gov is put in charge of health care they will screw it up the way they did when they created our current health care system. Yep, that's right. Many forget that it was Nixon who changed our health care system to the way it is today. What Nixon did was allow the insurance companies to have complete dominion over every facet of the health care field. They can control prices, how much or how little people receive, how much a doctor gets paid, whether a person lives or dies, etc. It did not work this way before. I am sure many of you remember how it worked before this. You had health insurance the same way you had any other kind of insurance... For emergencies. If it wasn't an emergency, then you paid out of pocket. And, that my friends is what kept the cost of health care down. That is what is known as market based pricing. The doctors could not raise prices past the peoples ability to pay. I don't understand why people are not advocating going back to this way of doing things rather than thinking that the government knows its a** from a hole in the ground and can run the medical industry. The government has screwed up almost every thing it has ever gotten its hands on. Why would health care be any different? Show me one thing that the government did right and I may consider it. Until then, hell no!!!",
