Perhaps, as a new poster you might consider telling us a bit about yourself before asking what I for one consider to be an inane question. The answer comes not from detailed military knowledge but from common sense. Of course the military will not pay for teeth whitening any more than it will pay for tanning salons, hair coloring, toupees or any other purely cosmetic procedure. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",
