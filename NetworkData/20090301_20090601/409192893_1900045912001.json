The GOP budget would repeal the entire $787 billion economic stimulus package except for an extension of unemployment insurance benefits.

Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, said in a written statement.

Campaign about further drilling and exploration to get votes, but do the opposite. Yup, just words, just inaction, and just more broken promises. I will say this again. The free market has done more for the environment than the IPCC, Al Gore, the UN, the alarmists and so on. Proven fact. Cap and trade, a bogus new market that makes oil futures look like child's play, will do nothing to better the environment. Nor will carbon taxes and the other scams they are trying to come up with. Seems you need the government to do your research, and tell you what is good for you. I guess you rely on the alarmists, Al Gore and the IPCC to better the environment, instead of the free market. The free market has concrete results, unlike that of your friends. It's amazing that people in this country oppose further drilling and exploration here. All while relying on other countries, who have been experiencing substantial growth in revenues and Real GDP, as well as job creation. The US is greedy, and doesn't deserve to create more jobs, and more wealth here. Let overseas keep their wealth, jobs and prosperity. Not for the US though . Keep dreaming about the 95% tax cuts. They will be heavily offset by cap and trade, and carbon taxes. Maybe you can break free of the bubble and step into reality. There are members on both sides to share the blame. I have already posted my criticism about the Bush admin, as well as others. Something you seem to be unable to do with your own party.",

Campaign about further drilling and exploration to get votes, but do the opposite. Yup, just words, just inaction, and just more broken promises. I will say this again. The free market has done more for the environment than the IPCC, Al Gore, the UN, the alarmists and so on. Proven fact. Cap and trade, a bogus new market that makes oil futures look like child's play, will do nothing to better the environment. Nor will carbon taxes and the other scams they are trying to come up with. Seems you need the government to do your research, and tell you what is good for you. I guess you rely on the alarmists, Al Gore and the IPCC to better the environment, instead of the free market. The free market has concrete results, unlike that of your friends. It's amazing that people in this country oppose further drilling and exploration here. All while relying on other countries, who have been experiencing substantial growth in revenues and Real GDP, as well as job creation. The US is greedy, and doesn't deserve to create more jobs, and more wealth here. Let overseas keep their wealth, jobs and prosperity. Not for the US though . Keep dreaming about the 95% tax cuts. They will be heavily offset by cap and trade, and carbon taxes. Maybe you can break free of the bubble and step into reality. There are members on both sides to share the blame. I have already posted my criticism about the Bush admin, as well as others. Something you seem to be unable to do with your own party.",
