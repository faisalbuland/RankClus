Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I do not see the DPRK initiating a first strike with nukes, they have very little to gain and everything to lose by doing so. As far as their army \"pouring\" across the border, please do not forget that there are over 600K well-trained South Korean troops to oppose them and that any massing of DPRK formations will open them up to air strikes and, if chemical weapons are used, retailation in kind. Given 7-10 days time, we could have the USMC out of Okinawa, USAF assets from the region, and the rest of the 2 ID in country. The follow-on plans we have are very detailed and can be put in motion rather quickly. Plus I find it hard to believe that any country would stand with the DPRK if they did employ nukes. I can not see China trading economic status or any of their military installations to support the DPRK. The DPRK is not as well equiped to attack south as people think. In the end it would be 1,000,000 partially trained and fed DPRK troops versus 600K+ ROK troops backed up by a couple of US divisions with lots of air support (USN/USMC/USAF). It is not June of 1950. As far as them running their mouths, what is new about this? They have been doing it for 55+ years.",

I did not vote for President Obama but, when it comes to facing that enemies of our nation, I will stand behind our President and our Armed Forces 210% and tell our enemies, \"You just picked on the wrong people!\"... It bothers me, no end, when some on here try and make every thing a \"republican and George Bush thing\" and I will not try and make it a President Obama thing... Not saying you are but, I will not do it myself... I despised those posts that were pure BDS and I afford the posts that are ODS the same degree of respect... I may and will disagree with some of the things that the President is trying to do, I think that some of them are wrong and that, yes, some of the things he's trying are right...

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I do not see the DPRK initiating a first strike with nukes, they have very little to gain and everything to lose by doing so. As far as their army \"pouring\" across the border, please do not forget that there are over 600K well-trained South Korean troops to oppose them and that any massing of DPRK formations will open them up to air strikes and, if chemical weapons are used, retailation in kind. Given 7-10 days time, we could have the USMC out of Okinawa, USAF assets from the region, and the rest of the 2 ID in country. The follow-on plans we have are very detailed and can be put in motion rather quickly. Plus I find it hard to believe that any country would stand with the DPRK if they did employ nukes. I can not see China trading economic status or any of their military installations to support the DPRK. The DPRK is not as well equiped to attack south as people think. In the end it would be 1,000,000 partially trained and fed DPRK troops versus 600K+ ROK troops backed up by a couple of US divisions with lots of air support (USN/USMC/USAF). It is not June of 1950. As far as them running their mouths, what is new about this? They have been doing it for 55+ years.",

        "reply": " I will not phrase it in that manner... I did not vote for President Obama but, when it comes to facing that enemies of our nation, I will stand behind our President and our Armed Forces 210% and tell our enemies, \"You just picked on the wrong people!\"... It bothers me, no end, when some on here try and make every thing a \"republican and George Bush thing\" and I will not try and make it a President Obama thing... Not saying you are but, I will not do it myself... I despised those posts that were pure BDS and I afford the posts that are ODS the same degree of respect... I may and will disagree with some of the things that the President is trying to do, I think that some of them are wrong and that, yes, some of the things he's trying are right... I will give him his one hundred days in office and then I will speak my mind on the subject... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I do not see the DPRK initiating a first strike with nukes, they have very little to gain and everything to lose by doing so. As far as their army \"pouring\" across the border, please do not forget that there are over 600K well-trained South Korean troops to oppose them and that any massing of DPRK formations will open them up to air strikes and, if chemical weapons are used, retailation in kind. Given 7-10 days time, we could have the USMC out of Okinawa, USAF assets from the region, and the rest of the 2 ID in country. The follow-on plans we have are very detailed and can be put in motion rather quickly. Plus I find it hard to believe that any country would stand with the DPRK if they did employ nukes. I can not see China trading economic status or any of their military installations to support the DPRK. The DPRK is not as well equiped to attack south as people think. In the end it would be 1,000,000 partially trained and fed DPRK troops versus 600K+ ROK troops backed up by a couple of US divisions with lots of air support (USN/USMC/USAF). It is not June of 1950. As far as them running their mouths, what is new about this? They have been doing it for 55+ years.",
