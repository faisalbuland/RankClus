The first step would be to register via the goarmy web page. Once the form is submitted, the webpage will provide you with telephone numbers that you may call to ask questions. They \"may\" then also call you back for a telephone interview (My understanding is that this is some sort of a pre-screening). Another method would be to directly call and discuss the program with an Army Recruiter in NYC. Note: Eventually you may end up traveling to NYC (possibly several times)at your own expense to get through all the \"special\" interviews and testing, etc. for this program. That is even before your visit(s)to the MEPS in NYC for the ASVAB & Medical exams and more interviews, etc. As far as I know, only the Army has started the recruiting for this program. Initially the recruitment of the \"language\" specialists will be limited to those in New York City, and then \"possibly\" expanded to the rest of the country later this year. As it stated in the DOD announcement about the MAVNI program back in December, the \"Non-immigrant\" visa holder must have been present in the US for at least the past 2 years (with no departures out of the country of greater than 90 days). They do check with the Department of Homeland Security/Immigration to verify your legal status here and how long you have been in the US before any further processing/testing takes place. From what I understand, for this program, there are also \"additional\" exams that be passed in both the foreign language you claim you know as well as an english language exam. Low scores in any and you are disqualified. Then there are then the \"regular\" interviews, medical exams, background checks, finger printing that all \"potential\" enlistees go thru. Based on not being a US Citizen (yet), and that it is then likely than your parents are not either, it is very unlikely that you would be allowed into a MOS's that requires a security clearance, so your choices of MOS's will be somewhat limited. Be aware that if you get through the interviews and background checks for further consideration, that when you later take the ASVAB, you will need to score a minimum of 50 to remain eligible (No waivers). In addition to all the above: Although you may be granted some form of \"conditional\" US Citizenship within the first 6-12 months on active duty, if you then fail to complete your mandatory 4 years on active duty in a acceptable manner, followed by additional years in the Reserves/IRR, that in all probability, the conditional citizenship will be revoked if you leave the military early or in less than a Honorable discharge. FYI: Don't bother applying if you don't meet ALL the basic requirements for the program as outlined in the MAVNI announcement....there are no waivers. In response to \"Ruanne\": I believe I read a quote somewhere from a high ranking military officer saying that the military services has found it easier to take an immigrant, or a potential one(who already fluently knows the foreign language and culture), and train him/her into a quality US Soldier, than it is to take a soldier and train him/her to be fluent in many of the specific foreign languages and cultures that they are looking for. (That is not a exact quote as I cannot currently find that article that I was reading, but it's out there somewhere on the internet). NOTE: I certainly mean absolutely no disrespect to the many fine Americans who have put forth the effort to become fluent in a foreign language and have served, or are currently serving, in the US Military!",

        "content": "A few points to be made: To quote the DOD: Non-citizens have served in the military since the Revolutionary War. Today, about 29,000 non-citizens serve in uniform, and about 8,000 legal permanent resident aliens (green card holders) enlist each year. According to data from the Department of Defense, more than 65,000 immigrants (non-US citizens and naturalized citizens) were serving on active duty in the US Armed Forces as of February 2008. Since September 2001, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has naturalized more than 37,250 foreign-born members of the US Armed Forces and granted posthumous citizenship to 111 service members. <-- It certainly doesn't sound like these men and women were \"sneaking across the border and waiting on the free medical and social services\" or that \"they don't come here to be AMERICANS anymore, they just want all the free stuff\". The ONLY non-citizens/non-immigrant visa holders that are even considered for the MAVNI Program are those that have been here in the United States LEGALLY for 2 or more years with proper Visas issued by the US Government. Those trying to enlist through the MAVNI program are being throughly screened by both the Military and the Department of Homeland Security. Any applicants that have fallen \"out-of-status\" with their Visa or even overstayed their permitted stay in the US by 1 day are disqualified. Furthermore, no one with a criminal record is eligible under the MAVNI program and they are not permitted to apply for the \u201cconduct waivers\u201d that are sometimes available to US citizens. <-- I agree with the DOD, why not recruit the best of those legal non-immigrants with the background, talents and skills that the US Military has a need for, and that the DOD has determined to be \"Vital to National Interests\". I also suggest that a few people here also need to keep in mind that unless you are pure Native American (American Indian), it is very likely that your ancestors also immigrated to this country at some point in time.

        "reply": "A few points to be made: To quote the DOD: Non-citizens have served in the military since the Revolutionary War. Today, about 29,000 non-citizens serve in uniform, and about 8,000 legal permanent resident aliens (green card holders) enlist each year. According to data from the Department of Defense, more than 65,000 immigrants (non-US citizens and naturalized citizens) were serving on active duty in the US Armed Forces as of February 2008. Since September 2001, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has naturalized more than 37,250 foreign-born members of the US Armed Forces and granted posthumous citizenship to 111 service members. <-- It certainly doesn't sound like these men and women were \"sneaking across the border and waiting on the free medical and social services\" or that \"they don't come here to be AMERICANS anymore, they just want all the free stuff\". The ONLY non-citizens/non-immigrant visa holders that are even considered for the MAVNI Program are those that have been here in the United States LEGALLY for 2 or more years with proper Visas issued by the US Government. Those trying to enlist through the MAVNI program are being throughly screened by both the Military and the Department of Homeland Security. Any applicants that have fallen \"out-of-status\" with their Visa or even overstayed their permitted stay in the US by 1 day are disqualified. Furthermore, no one with a criminal record is eligible under the MAVNI program and they are not permitted to apply for the \u201cconduct waivers\u201d that are sometimes available to US citizens. <-- I agree with the DOD, why not recruit the best of those legal non-immigrants with the background, talents and skills that the US Military has a need for, and that the DOD has determined to be \"Vital to National Interests\".
