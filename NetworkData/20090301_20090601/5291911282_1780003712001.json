Tri-care would have still covered it. Yes, I've heard some horror stories, and have one of my own regarding one of my sons. However, I encounter the same amt of storeis at each post, so I can't say that Ft. Campbell is worse. Please be deligent, none of us are docs here, and you need to go to a different hospital. I am sorry that happened to you. I know it's not easy taking care of 4 kids at your age when you haven't done it in decades. Maybe you could have your flight delayed? When your son and his wife gets back, you won't be in a time crunch. I hate to pass it off, but it also could be as simple as some bad acid reflux. That stuff mimicks all kinds of serious conditions.

        "content": "No - the liver is on the right, pancreas and spleen on the left. But anyway ... Mouse, you seem to have a severe case of self-diagnosis via computer. You've got every symptom known to man and are combining them in every way possible. I don't mean disrespect, but you really don't know what the hell you're talking about when you demand a CT scan, ultrasound, MRI or other diagnostic tests. While it's true that providers should treat the patient and symptoms, and not the lab results, you don't help them much. You sound like you've been Googling left-sided abdominal pain and have written down a laundry-list of possibilities from Symptoms-R-Us dot com. The best thing any patient can do is fully describe the symptoms: duration, location, intensity, onset, what makes them better/worse, etc. Let the provider - NP, PA, doc - chase down the diagnosis. One thing that might be hindering your care is the fact that you are in the area temporarily. Generally speaking, if you are visiting an area and a medical problem is non-life-threatening, providers are reluctant to get into long, involved diagnostic studies when (1) they don't know your history, (2) don't have access to your medical records, (3) are not your regular providers, and (4) will not be able to follow up on exams, results, further treatment. IF this were a life-threatening emergency, it would be a different story. What if you DID have pancreatitis, or cancer, or a broken rib? Except for the last one, would you stick around Ft. Cambell for a full work-up, treatment and follow-up? I don't think so. You'd high-tail it home to see your regular provider.

        "reply": "No - the liver is on the right, pancreas and spleen on the left. But anyway ... Mouse, you seem to have a severe case of self-diagnosis via computer. You've got every symptom known to man and are combining them in every way possible. I don't mean disrespect, but you really don't know what the hell you're talking about when you demand a CT scan, ultrasound, MRI or other diagnostic tests. While it's true that providers should treat the patient and symptoms, and not the lab results, you don't help them much. You sound like you've been Googling left-sided abdominal pain and have written down a laundry-list of possibilities from Symptoms-R-Us dot com. The best thing any patient can do is fully describe the symptoms: duration, location, intensity, onset, what makes them better/worse, etc. Let the provider - NP, PA, doc - chase down the diagnosis. One thing that might be hindering your care is the fact that you are in the area temporarily. Generally speaking, if you are visiting an area and a medical problem is non-life-threatening, providers are reluctant to get into long, involved diagnostic studies when (1) they don't know your history, (2) don't have access to your medical records, (3) are not your regular providers, and (4) will not be able to follow up on exams, results, further treatment. IF this were a life-threatening emergency, it would be a different story. What if you DID have pancreatitis, or cancer, or a broken rib? Except for the last one, would you stick around Ft. Cambell for a full work-up, treatment and follow-up? I don't think so. You'd high-tail it home to see your regular provider.

I do like the military health care and trust tricare more than I do lets say like the lady said..blue cross blue shield of tx...and I wont go on and describe it any further as it was a sort of exclusive insurance ..there are different blue cross blue shields of tx...You just have to make sure you read the fine print on that..deny, deny , deny...I know about that..with civilian insurances...they use to be really good..but over the years things have changed..to where I trust tricare more now...as long as you follow the rules...I guess i was complaining abt just fort campbell..I think there is more to it...they use the emergency as a regular sick clinic ..if you know that area..its the acute care clinic along with emergency...which sometimes acute is really emergency... It was an emergency for me..I knew there were people who died of empaction and had a friend who nearly did twice. He had emergency surgery which saved his life. I never had anything like this and didnt know what it was..I had empaction before but not like this. I was imobile for nearly a yr...I had a 3rd seizure and was bed ridden for abt 5 mos. I was put on diff. meds that nearly killed me ..cost me muscle wasting and bone wasting and some heart issues....then I convinced my husband to quit his job and move near his mom who was bad off as well, and she is 80....while we were moving ourselves I broke 3 ribs and then a double fold door fell on my head..but I kept up with the move..I arranged the entire thing and packed up everything..all 5 kids worth...I unpacked everything alone..so Im a mover...I have had problems since birth with intestines..but this didnt feel like an intestinal thing..we still arent sure if the bubble is in the gut..I will say it probably is myself..I was given..reglan and told to get mineral oil..which I did..but know this..I was going..I didnt have any problems going...no problem at all..so that is why this bubble was a concern..that it might be something else..its in the upper portion under the breast on the left side under the ribcage...the pain over time did go away..i felt lucky and also the bubble seemed to get smaller..but then I had to fly home again and bang ..it got huge again..so because of this experience...I now know that altitude can and does affect air in the body if that is what this is...I still have no real fever, or, anything else except a cold..I cant bend to the left side..it hampers me moving..Im only on two meds..keppra a seizure drug..and desipramine..an antidepressant I was put on after a hysterectomy when I was 37 yrs old..I was allergic to premarin an estrogen made from horses...I was allergic to horses and to premarin but was forced to take it way back in the 80's..i was young and didnt know any better..it almost killed me..I went to a specialist later and found all this out from a simple blood test...all because the person listened to what I said..it could have saved me months of being so ill ..I had 5 kids to raise and was a total mess..however, i did learn something..TO FIGHT FOR ONES HEALTH...TO NOT JUST SIT BACK AND LET IT HAPPEN...wilford hall did a great job on the hysterectomy surgery part..very good..I have to commend them on that the dr i had was type A...the best kind to get and he also listened to what I said which made it easy...less stress and..less cost..cost effective...the followup was the problem..I kept goign in looking like i was at deaths door...and saying the same thing..then after awhle of this they began to say aw she is just depressed..so they would send me to the triage and i would talk to them ..3 times that happened and each time they would say after I said ok if that is what they want..I would talk and then force myself to cry..and then feeling rediculous not me the actual triage..would say...you know they dont know what is wrong..and they are passing the buck...so i went to a shrink and got the antidepressant..desipramine..I then went to a female specialist and she did teh blood test and found I was allergic to premarin..as its FOUND NOW THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE..HOWEVER, KNOW THIS...IT, PREMARIN, WAS TOUTED AT THE TIME AS BEING THE NATURAL ESTROGEN ..and there was something wrong with me not it...so i was put on a different estrogen and the antidepressant..then after 10 yrs i tried to get off THE ANTIDEPRESSANT slowly and bang my first seizure...I was allergic to nearly all seizure drugs...bad side affects...I went back on again to the antidepressant to straighten out my stomach...then after another 10 yrs I said forget this I dont need this..so I tried again to get off and bang another seizure..so the antidepressant I was suppose to get on because I was supposedly depressed now causes me seizures...how fun is that..I only thank God that all my 5 kids are grown and my life style change doesnt affect my kids..I just cant drive..or be alone for too long...so ..life as it is can change because a few drs dont listen ...so, Im very leery of medicine or even herbs or supplements...foods and exercise is what I believe in...healthy food...so Im not ignorant of the fact...MRI is more what was needed...then we could know immediately where this bubble thing was...I saw this xray that was done..and the dr doesnt know exactly but ..it might be in the

of suffering with this...if it is my intestine..then is there any damage now from waiting to find out what it really is...now think about that..oh ...I use to be a runner and played tennis and too health supplements and walked ..I was the diligent one..I also watched what i ate..howver i have high cholesterol ..and so does my son who is a west point grad who runs every morning and eats oatmeal and healthy foods..so what is that..now you can see there are not garantees...the best results are those that find things out now not after going and going and goning in to see a dr over and over and taking medicine that is not necessary and sometimes harmful...then to spend the money at the one time visit and know what it is....you see there are two sides to every coin...thanks and God bless...i dont see a dr again until 2 weeks...Im on the mineral oil and the reglan..for 2 wks..as it is not good to take things for too long..and walking when my husband comes home as I cannot do it alone..remember seizures ..thank you",

        "reply": "thank you for all your comments possitive and negative..I will take it all...I guess what I posted is just in the present as U dont know my history. I do like the military health care and trust tricare more than I do lets say like the lady said..blue cross blue shield of tx...and I wont go on and describe it any further as it was a sort of exclusive insurance ..there are different blue cross blue shields of tx...You just have to make sure you read the fine print on that..deny, deny , deny...I know about that..with civilian insurances...they use to be really good..but over the years things have changed..to where I trust tricare more now...as long as you follow the rules...I guess i was complaining abt just fort campbell..I think there is more to it...they use the emergency as a regular sick clinic ..if you know that area..its the acute care clinic along with emergency...which sometimes acute is really emergency... It was an emergency for me..I knew there were people who died of empaction and had a friend who nearly did twice. He had emergency surgery which saved his life. I never had anything like this and didnt know what it was..I had empaction before but not like this. I was imobile for nearly a yr...I had a 3rd seizure and was bed ridden for abt 5 mos. I was put on diff. meds that nearly killed me ..cost me muscle wasting and bone wasting and some heart issues....then I convinced my husband to quit his job and move near his mom who was bad off as well, and she is 80....while we were moving ourselves I broke 3 ribs and then a double fold door fell on my head..but I kept up with the move..I arranged the entire thing and packed up everything..all 5 kids worth...I unpacked everything alone..so Im a mover...I have had problems since birth with intestines..but this didnt feel like an intestinal thing..we still arent sure if the bubble is in the gut..I will say it probably is myself..I was given..reglan and told to get mineral oil..which I did..but know this..I was going..I didnt have any problems going...no problem at all..so that is why this bubble was a concern..that it might be something else..its in the upper portion under the breast on the left side under the ribcage...the pain over time did go away..i felt lucky and also the bubble seemed to get smaller..but then I had to fly home again and bang ..it got huge again..so because of this experience...I now know that altitude can and does affect air in the body if that is what this is...I still have no real fever, or, anything else except a cold..I cant bend to the left side..it hampers me moving..Im only on two meds..keppra a seizure drug..and desipramine..an antidepressant I was put on after a hysterectomy when I was 37 yrs old..I was allergic to premarin an estrogen made from horses...I was allergic to horses and to premarin but was forced to take it way back in the 80's..i was young and didnt know any better..it almost killed me..I went to a specialist later and found all this out from a simple blood test...all because the person listened to what I said..it could have saved me months of being so ill ..I had 5 kids to raise and was a total mess..however, i did learn something..TO FIGHT FOR ONES HEALTH...TO NOT JUST SIT BACK AND LET IT HAPPEN...wilford hall did a great job on the hysterectomy surgery part..very good..I have to commend them on that the dr i had was type A...the best kind to get and he also listened to what I said which made it easy...less stress and..less cost..cost effective...the followup was the problem..I kept goign in looking like i was at deaths door...and saying the same thing..then after awhle of this they began to say aw she is just depressed..so they would send me to the triage and i would talk to them ..3 times that happened and each time they would say after I said ok if that is what they want..I would talk and then force myself to cry..and then feeling rediculous not me the actual triage..would say...you know they dont know what is wrong..and they are passing the buck...so i went to a shrink and got the antidepressant..desipramine..I then went to a female specialist and she did teh blood test and found I was allergic to premarin..as its FOUND NOW THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE..HOWEVER, KNOW THIS...IT, PREMARIN, WAS TOUTED AT THE TIME AS BEING THE NATURAL ESTROGEN ..and there was something wrong with me not it...so i was put on a different estrogen and the antidepressant..then after 10 yrs i tried to get off THE ANTIDEPRESSANT slowly and bang my first seizure...I was allergic to nearly all seizure drugs...bad side affects...I went back on again to the antidepressant to straighten out my stomach...then after another 10 yrs I said forget this I dont need this..so I tried again to get off and bang another seizure..so the antidepressant I was suppose to get on because I was supposedly depressed now causes me seizures...how fun is that..I only thank God that all my 5 kids are grown and my life style change doesnt affect my kids..I just cant drive..or be alone for too long...so ..life as it is can change because a few drs dont listen ...so, Im very leery of medicine or even herbs or supplements...foods and exercise is what I believe in...healthy food...so Im not ignorant of the fact...MRI is more what was needed...then we could know immediately where this bubble thing was...I saw this xray that was done..and the dr doesnt know exactly but ..it might be in the gut so he gave me meds for it...if it isnt then i have wasted time trying to do the wrong thing...finding out is the prime point...wasting money going to the dr over and over ..its been abt 3 wks now of suffering with this...if it is my intestine..then is there any damage now from waiting to find out what it really is...now think about that..oh ...I use to be a runner and played tennis and too

However, I encounter the same amt of storeis at each post, so I can't say that Ft. Campbell is worse. Please be deligent, none of us are docs here, and you need to go to a different hospital. I am sorry that happened to you. I know it's not easy taking care of 4 kids at your age when you haven't done it in decades. Maybe you could have your flight delayed? When your son and his wife gets back, you won't be in a time crunch. I hate to pass it off, but it also could be as simple as some bad acid reflux. That stuff mimicks all kinds of serious conditions.

I don't mean disrespect, but you really don't know what the hell you're talking about when you demand a CT scan, ultrasound, MRI or other diagnostic tests. While it's true that providers should treat the patient and symptoms, and not the lab results, you don't help them much.

One thing that might be hindering your care is the fact that you are in the area temporarily. Generally speaking, if you are visiting an area and a medical problem is non-life-threatening, providers are reluctant to get into long, involved diagnostic studies when (1) they don't know your history, (2) don't have access to your medical records, (3) are not your regular providers, and (4) will not be able to follow up on exams, results, further treatment. IF this were a life-threatening emergency, it would be a different story. What if you DID have pancreatitis, or cancer, or a broken rib? Except for the last one, would you stick around Ft.

Being able to discriminate what tests are necessary, and when, is one of the many reasons why it takes 15 years to make a board-certified or board-eligible MD/DO (undergrad + med school + residency). And you or Mouse want to argue that 15 minutes of online investigating is more meaningful or contributive? Do you have to ask why I disagree? One thing about military healthcare: it is far less obsessed with CYA than civilian healthcare, so in that area alone is more cost-effective.",

I do like the military health care and trust tricare more than I do lets say like the lady said..blue cross blue shield of tx...and I wont go on and describe it any further as it was a sort of exclusive insurance ..there are different blue cross blue shields of tx...You just have to make sure you read the fine print on that..deny, deny , deny...I know about that..with civilian insurances...they use to be really good..but over the years things have changed..to where I trust tricare more now...as long as you follow the rules...I guess i was complaining abt just fort campbell..I think there is more to it...they use the emergency as a regular sick clinic ..if you know that area..its the acute care clinic along with emergency...which sometimes acute is really emergency... It was an emergency for me..I knew there were people who died of empaction and had a friend who nearly did twice. He had emergency surgery which saved his life. I never had anything like this and didnt know what it was..I had empaction before but not like this. I was imobile for nearly a yr...I had a 3rd seizure and was bed ridden for abt 5 mos. I was put on diff. meds that nearly killed me ..cost me muscle wasting and bone wasting and some heart issues....then I convinced my husband to quit his job and move near his mom who was bad off as well, and she is 80....while we were moving ourselves I broke 3 ribs and then a double fold door fell on my head..but I kept up with the move..I arranged the entire thing and packed up everything..all 5 kids worth...I unpacked everything alone..so Im a mover...I have had problems since birth with intestines..but this didnt feel like an intestinal thing..we still arent sure if the bubble is in the gut..I will say it probably is myself..I was given..reglan and told to get mineral oil..which I did..but know this..I was going..I didnt have any problems going...no problem at all..so that is why this bubble was a concern..that it might be something else..its in the upper portion under the breast on the left side under the ribcage...the pain over time did go away..i felt lucky and also the bubble seemed to get smaller..but then I had to fly home again and bang ..it got huge again..so because of this experience...I now know that altitude can and does affect air in the body if that is what this is...I still have no real fever, or, anything else except a cold..I cant bend to the left side..it hampers me moving..Im only on two meds..keppra a seizure drug..and desipramine..an antidepressant I was put on after a hysterectomy when I was 37 yrs old..I was allergic to premarin an estrogen made from horses...I was allergic to horses and to premarin but was forced to take it way back in the 80's..i was young and didnt know any better..it almost killed me..I went to a specialist later and found all this out from a simple blood test...all because the person listened to what I said..it could have saved me months of being so ill ..I had 5 kids to raise and was a total mess..however, i did learn something..TO FIGHT FOR ONES HEALTH...TO NOT JUST SIT BACK AND LET IT HAPPEN...wilford hall did a great job on the hysterectomy surgery part..very good..I have to commend them on that the dr i had was type A...the best kind to get and he also listened to what I said which made it easy...less stress and..less cost..cost effective...the followup was the problem..I kept goign in looking like i was at deaths door...and saying the same thing..then after awhle of this they began to say aw she is just depressed..so they would send me to the triage and i would talk to them ..3 times that happened and each time they would say after I said ok if that is what they want..I would talk and then force myself to cry..and then feeling rediculous not me the actual triage..would say...you know they dont know what is wrong..and they are passing the buck...so i went to a shrink and got the antidepressant..desipramine..I then went to a female specialist and she did teh blood test and found I was allergic to premarin..as its FOUND NOW THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE..HOWEVER, KNOW THIS...IT, PREMARIN, WAS TOUTED AT THE TIME AS BEING THE NATURAL ESTROGEN ..and there was something wrong with me not it...so i was put on a different estrogen and the antidepressant..then after 10 yrs i tried to get off THE ANTIDEPRESSANT slowly and bang my first seizure...I was allergic to nearly all seizure drugs...bad side affects...I went back on again to the antidepressant to straighten out my stomach...then after another 10 yrs I said forget this I dont need this..so I tried again to get off and bang another seizure..so the antidepressant I was suppose to get on because I was supposedly depressed now causes me seizures...how fun is that..I only thank God that all my 5 kids are grown and my life style change doesnt affect my kids..I just cant drive..or be alone for too long...so ..life as it is can change because a few drs dont listen ...so, Im very leery of medicine or even herbs or supplements...foods and exercise is what I believe in...healthy food...so Im not ignorant of the fact...MRI is more what was needed...then we could know immediately where this bubble thing was...I saw this xray that was done..and the dr doesnt know exactly but ..it might be in the gut so he gave me meds for it...if it isnt then i have wasted time trying to do the wrong thing...finding out is the prime point...wasting money going to the dr over and over ..its been abt 3 wks now of suffering with this...if it is my intestine..then is there any damage now from waiting to find out what it really is...now think about that..oh ...I use to be a runner and played tennis and too health supplements and walked ..I was the diligent one..I also watched what i ate..howver i have high cholesterol ..and so does my son who is a west point grad who runs every morning and eats oatmeal and healthy foods..so what is that..now you can see there are not garantees...the best results are those that find things out now not after going and going and goning in to see a dr over and over and taking medicine that is not necessary and sometimes harmful...then to spend the money at the one time visit and know what it is....you see there are two sides to every coin...thanks and God bless...i dont see a dr again until 2 weeks...Im on the mineral oil and the reglan..for 2 wks..as it is not good to take things for too long..and walking when my husband comes home as I cannot do it alone..remember seizures ..thank you",

However, I encounter the same amt of storeis at each post, so I can't say that Ft. Campbell is worse. Please be deligent, none of us are docs here, and you need to go to a different hospital. I am sorry that happened to you. I know it's not easy taking care of 4 kids at your age when you haven't done it in decades. Maybe you could have your flight delayed? When your son and his wife gets back, you won't be in a time crunch. I hate to pass it off, but it also could be as simple as some bad acid reflux. That stuff mimicks all kinds of serious conditions.

Generally speaking, if you are visiting an area and a medical problem is non-life-threatening, providers are reluctant to get into long, involved diagnostic studies when (1) they don't know your history, (2) don't have access to your medical records, (3) are not your regular providers, and (4) will not be able to follow up on exams, results, further treatment.

It's only been a change in diet, exercise and body weight. The additional time awake has more then compensated for the additional time running outdoors or in the Gym. The reduced food intake has compensated financially for the Gym fees and gas money spent to get there. The net change (time and financial) has been positive in my case. The additional time running outdoors has been cool because you would not believe all your missing with nature. Turkey vultures, Armadillos, Skunks, Foxes, Cayotes, Horses, Longhorns, Snakes, etc, etc. I can't believe the animal life around my house. Never even saw them until I started running outdoors (best time is dawn and dusk). So take up walking outdoors at least, your missing a lot in the quality of life area if your not spending time outdoors.",

Do them at the whim of patients, without justification, and you start to have an understanding of why healthcare costs are as high as they are. Being able to discriminate what tests are necessary, and when, is one of the many reasons why it takes 15 years to make a board-certified or board-eligible MD/DO (undergrad + med school + residency). And you or Mouse want to argue that 15 minutes of online investigating is more meaningful or contributive? Do you have to ask why I disagree? One thing about military healthcare: it is far less obsessed with CYA than civilian healthcare, so in that area alone is more cost-effective.",

I do like the military health care and trust tricare more than I do lets say like the lady said..blue cross blue shield of tx...and I wont go on and describe it any further as it was a sort of exclusive insurance ..there are different blue cross blue shields of tx...You just have to make sure you read the fine print on that..deny, deny , deny...I know about that..with civilian insurances...they use to be really good..but over the years things have changed..to where I trust tricare more now...as long as you follow the rules...I guess i was complaining abt just fort campbell..I think there is more to it...they use the emergency as a regular sick clinic ..if you know that area..its the acute care clinic along with emergency...which sometimes acute is really emergency... It was an emergency for me..I knew there were people who died of empaction and had a friend who nearly did twice. He had emergency surgery which saved his life. I never had anything like this and didnt know what it was..I had empaction before but not like this. I was imobile for nearly a yr...I had a 3rd seizure and was bed ridden for abt 5 mos. I was put on diff. meds that nearly killed me ..cost me muscle wasting and bone wasting and some heart issues....then I convinced my husband to quit his job and move near his mom who was bad off as well, and she is 80....while we were moving ourselves I broke 3 ribs and then a double fold door fell on my head..but I kept up with the move..I arranged the entire thing and packed up everything..all 5 kids worth...I unpacked everything alone..so Im a mover...I have had problems since birth with intestines..but this didnt feel like an intestinal thing..we still arent sure if the bubble is in the gut..I will say it probably is myself..I was given..reglan and told to get mineral oil..which I did..but know this..I was going..I didnt have any problems going...no problem at all..so that is why this bubble was a concern..that it might be something else..its in the upper portion under the breast on the left side under the ribcage...the pain over time did go away..i felt lucky and also the bubble seemed to get smaller..but then I had to fly home again and bang ..it got huge again..so because of this experience...I now know that altitude can and does affect air in the body if that is what this is...I still have no real fever, or, anything else except a cold..I cant bend to the left side..it hampers me moving..Im only on two meds..keppra a seizure drug..and desipramine..an antidepressant I was put on after a hysterectomy when I was 37 yrs old..I was allergic to premarin an estrogen made from horses...I was allergic to horses and to premarin but was forced to take it way back in the 80's..i was young and didnt know any better..it almost killed me..I went to a specialist later and found all this out from a simple blood test...all because the person listened to what I said..it could have saved me months of being so ill ..I had 5 kids to raise and was a total mess..however, i did learn something..TO FIGHT FOR ONES HEALTH...TO NOT JUST SIT BACK AND LET IT HAPPEN...wilford hall did a great job on the hysterectomy surgery part..very good..I have to commend them on that the dr i had was type A...the best kind to get and he also listened to what I said which made it easy...less stress and..less cost..cost effective...the followup was the problem..I kept goign in looking like i was at deaths door...and saying the same thing..then after awhle of this they began to say aw she is just depressed..so they would send me to the triage and i would talk to them ..3 times that happened and each time they would say after I said ok if that is what they want..I would talk and then force myself to cry..and then feeling rediculous not me the actual triage..would say...you know they dont know what is wrong..and they are passing the buck...so i went to a shrink and got the antidepressant..desipramine..I then went to a female specialist and she did teh blood test and found I was allergic to premarin..as its FOUND NOW THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE..HOWEVER, KNOW THIS...IT, PREMARIN, WAS TOUTED AT THE TIME AS BEING THE NATURAL ESTROGEN ..and there was something wrong with me not it...so i was put on a different estrogen and the antidepressant..then after 10 yrs i tried to get off THE ANTIDEPRESSANT slowly and bang my first seizure...I was allergic to nearly all seizure drugs...bad side affects...I went back on again to the antidepressant to straighten out my stomach...then after another 10 yrs I said forget this I dont need this..so I tried again to get off and bang another seizure..so the antidepressant I was suppose to get on because I was supposedly depressed now causes me seizures...how fun is that..I only thank God that all my 5 kids are grown and my life style change doesnt affect my kids..I just cant drive..or be alone for too long...so ..life as it is can change because a few drs dont listen ...so, Im very leery of medicine or even herbs or supplements...foods and exercise is what I believe in...healthy food...so Im not ignorant of the fact...MRI is more what was needed...then we could know immediately where this bubble thing was...I saw this xray that was done..and the dr doesnt know exactly but ..it might be in the gut so he gave me meds for it...if it isnt then i have wasted time trying to do the wrong thing...finding out is the prime point...wasting money going to the dr over and over ..its been abt 3 wks now of suffering with this...if it is my intestine..then is there any damage now from waiting to find out what it really is...now think about that..oh ...I use to be a runner and played tennis and too health supplements and walked ..I was the diligent one..I also watched what i ate..howver i have high cholesterol ..and so does my son who is a west point grad who runs every morning and eats oatmeal and healthy foods..so what is that..now you can see there are not garantees...the best results are those that find things out now not after going and going and goning in to see a dr over and over and taking medicine that is not necessary and sometimes harmful...then to spend the money at the one time visit and know what it is....you see there are two sides to every coin...thanks and God bless...i dont see a dr again until 2 weeks...Im on the mineral oil and the reglan..for 2 wks..as it is not good to take things for too long..and walking when my husband comes home as I cannot do it alone..remember seizures ..thank you",
