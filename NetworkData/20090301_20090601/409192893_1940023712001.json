It's just not right and everybody knows it -- it's just not right when the average CEO makes $10,000 more every day...than what the average worker makes every year.\u201d he said. The vice president noted that the administration is determined to see that taxpayer dollars \"go to something other than union-busting activities.\u201d He mentioned the stimulus package, which will funnel taxpayer dollars to union jobs: \"The focus of this administration the first month has been to rebuild American roads, bridges, waterways -- jobs for the building trades union. Investing and getting more people access to broadband -- communication workers. Creating clean energy economy -- jobs that require electrical workers to modernize the grid, steel workers to go out and build the wind turbines, laborers to install the solar panels. Making our communities safer, jobs that require getting cops on the beat and keeping firefighters in firehouses. That's what we're trying to do.\" He also mentioned investment in schools (teachers unions). <edit> According to Biden, the nation's policy -- as expressed in the National Labor Relations Act -- is to \"encourage collective bargaining, encourage unions.\" He said it's not enough for corporations and government to \"tolerate\" workers forming unions -- \"after using every trick in the book\" to block them. Biden reassured labor leaders that he and President Barack Obama agree, \"You can't have a strong middle class without a strong labor movement.\" And Biden repeated that he and Obama will judge the success or failure of their administration on whether the middle class standard of living has increased during their first term. Biden described teachers, police officers, firefighters, hospital workers and factory workers are the \"nation's heart and soul.\" And while bankers and financiers are \"necessary,\" \"they are not the spine of the system,\" he said. Biden says the middle class has been \"slipping\" in recent years because the \u201csocial contract\u201d is out of balance. When productivity goes up, the people responsible for that productivity are supposed to benefit. That\u2019s the \u201cdeal,\u201d he said: \u201cWe don't want chief executives and wealthy people not to get wealthy. That's okay by us. Every one of us hope our kids end up there some day.\u201d But Biden said the deal involves workers getting a piece of the higher profits generated by their labor: \u201cWhile a company\u2019s management may come up with a good idea, workers \u201chelp make it happen\u2026we do things faster and better and cheaper for you so the profit margin increases -- the deal was we get a piece of that. We get a piece of it -- a fair piece. That's the bargain.\u201d Biden added that workers who helped boost productivity in recent years have seen the value of their incomes drop. \"For too long the middle class has been dealt out. I'm here to tell you in this administration it is dealt in. It is the first card on the table.\" <edit> In a plug for the Employee Free Choice Act, Biden said the unions aren't asking for anything they don't deserve: \"We just want to level this playing field again.\" The Employee Free Choice Act, also known as the card-check bill, would require the government to certify a union after 51 percent of workers have openly signed a card saying they want to unionize. The measure would effectively eliminate secret ballot union elections, critics warn. \"I have a simple, basic belief, one that we're going to work hard to put into action: If a union is what you want, a union you're entitled to have,\" Biden said. Biden told the AFL-CIO there is no such thing as an \"inherently good job.\" \"They become good jobs when workers have an opportunity to insist that they get paid a fair wage, they get treated fairly, and they will benefit from the productivity that results from that industry. The union movement made them good jobs.\" Although it\u2019s going to be a \u201crough year,\u201d Biden says he\u2019s optimistic: \u201cI think we've got a ladder long enough, and I think when we climb out of this hole, if we do this right, it's going to be -- we climb onto a platform that's clearer, sturdier, better, more competitive for America, and put us in a position where we're able to do in the 21st century what we did in the 20th century. Our job in the meantime is to get as many people on that ladder as we can.\u201d Biden said there\u2019s a good chance of returning to the days of gainful employment and \u201cthe bargain\u201d that lifts workers: \u201cWe got a shot like we haven't had for the last 30 years,\u201d he said. Cameras were not allowed to cover Biden's speech, but his office released a transcript of his remarks.",

        "content": "All unions are not created equal. The building trades is a good example of this. There is a good balance in the building trades that could not exist without unions. Some of you may know that construction is not a steady industry. A company will get a project that lasts a year and may get a handful of projects here and there for the following year. It would not be cost effective to keep the same labor force in that second year as that big project that took place the year prior. In this case, the employer lays off the workers that it doesn't need. Then those workers go to their Union hall to sign the out of work list. Usually, within a week, they are put on another project with another employer. Problem solved. Also, since the union does all of the training and certification, the companies do not need to pay to train (most training funds are funding from employee wages, not their benefits package). And, when employers bid jobs, labor is extremely easy to calculate because the wages are standardized per region and in line with the agreement that the union has made with all of the union contractors in that particular region. On the flipside of that, let's say that a relatively small company that typically does 20 man projects finally gets a really BIG project like a stadium or something similar that requires roughly 300 trained and certified tradesmen (Laborers, Ironworkers, Pipefitters, Carpenters, Operators, etc). Obviously, that company does not have that many employees already and finding that many tradesmen that are certified and trained through the classifieds will probably yield much smaller numbers than what is required for the job. This is a simple fix in union projects: All the employer has to do is call the union halls for each trade and request the number of tradesmen they need. Problem solved. As for the pay, what most Construction Craft Tradesmen make is not as much as you may think. Plus, many of them are skilled workers and do extremely dangerous work. For instance, take an Ironworker who has to do 8000 hous of OJT as well as 1000 hours of classroom training before he gets Journeyman status. The majority of his days are spent many feet above ground, walking on beams that are 4\" to 8\" wide. That is 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week, every week. Many times, the only way for him to get from one level to the other is to climb the iron to the next level. If he is not trained in the proper techniques of welding and connecting steel, blueprint reading, and structural integrity measure, that building could collapse years in the future. Plus, ironworkers do not wear a harness when they are walking the iron because it is actually increases the danger of the job. Would you say that $24 an hour is paying this guy too much? If so, then you are nuts! Or, let's look at a Construction Craft Laborer. This guy must do 4000 hours of OJT and 500 hours of classroom training to get Journeyman status. This is probably some of the most grueling and dangerous work you will find in construction. Not only do these guys to all the environmental remediation (asbestos removal, HAZMAT removal, Radioactive waste removal, etc), they also do all of the demolition projects (explosive demo, controlled demo, refractory demo, etc). That means that a Laborer will spend much of his days behind a pnuematic hammer/mut, climbing structures at great height, working with highly dangerous materials, cutting steal structure at great height (aka, high burning), working inside steel manufacturing furnaces and ovens in temps up to 150 degrees, etc. Many of these guys bodies are completely broken when they finally retire at 55-60. Is $20 an hour too much for this guy? If so, then you are nuts. The simple fact is, unless you have a college degree or you have a skill, you shouldn't be making $50,000 a year. But, if you have a skill (such as a tradesman) or a degree, you have earned that $50,000 a year. You have paid your dues, so to speak. Now, the UAW, Teamsters, Grocery workers, etc. Yeah, those are problems. They are paying people massive amounts of money to do something that a chimp could do. But, for people who have no idea what they are talking about to lump in every union in America together and think that they operate the same way is just ignorant. Also, keep in mind that the Building Tradesmen do not get holiday pay, sick pay, etc. If they don't work, they don't get paid.",

But, for people who have no idea what they are talking about to lump in every union in America together and think that they operate the same way is just ignorant. Well laid out. I do have issue though that the general thought process (as shown by Joe the plumber) that if you are not union then you are not skilled. I have worked many years in construction and have worked right along union people doing the same jobs. I know there are many skilled workers out there who are union and non-union. What I did see as a non-union worker working next to the union worker was non-unions were harassed and put in danger by the union workers. I saw deliberate slow downs to hamper the non-union companies (they probably still have not found their steel ). The productivity was not even close comparing the two. Non-unions ran circles around the unions on every job that I was on because we had to. There were other jobs waiting on us which drove us. I did not see a difference in quality. Both can be poor or good , but when a good empowered inspector was on the site quality was high. However, a private companies very reputation is on the line and our owners were up our rears making sure the customer got what they paid for. Other than the deliberate endangerment and harassment I do not care. If the customer wants to pay for it then it is on them. I do not like the mandate that X amount of government work must be union labor and I think this is the most unfair to the tax payer. I do appreciate the sheer volume of training Union members receive but know first hand that OJT is where the real experience is gained. However, there was one job where a private contractor brought in \u201cillegals?\u201d by the bus load and the whole job site went to crap very quickly.",

That means that a Laborer will spend much of his days behind a pnuematic hammer/mut, climbing structures at great height, working with highly dangerous materials, cutting steal structure at great height (aka, high burning), working inside steel manufacturing furnaces and ovens in temps up to 150 degrees, etc. Many of these guys bodies are completely broken when they finally retire at 55-60. Is $20 an hour too much for this guy? If so, then you are nuts. The simple fact is, unless you have a college degree or you have a skill, you shouldn't be making $50,000 a year. But, if you have a skill (such as a tradesman) or a degree, you have earned that $50,000 a year. Now, the UAW, Teamsters, Grocery workers, etc. Yeah, those are problems. They are paying people massive amounts of money to do something that a chimp could do. But, for people who have no idea what they are talking about to lump in every union in America together and think that they operate the same way is just ignorant.", 
        "reply": " Well laid out. I do have issue though that the general thought process (as shown by Joe the plumber) that if you are not union then you are not skilled. I have worked many years in construction and have worked right along union people doing the same jobs. I know there are many skilled workers out there who are union and non-union. What I did see as a non-union worker working next to the union worker was non-unions were harassed and put in danger by the union workers. I saw deliberate slow downs to hamper the non-union companies (they probably still have not found their steel ). The productivity was not even close comparing the two. Non-unions ran circles around the unions on every job that I was on because we had to. There were other jobs waiting on us which drove us. I did not see a difference in quality. Both can be poor or good , but when a good empowered inspector was on the site quality was high. However, a private companies very reputation is on the line and our owners were up our rears making sure the customer got what they paid for. Other than the deliberate endangerment and harassment I do not care. If the customer wants to pay for it then it is on them. I do not like the mandate that X amount of government work must be union labor and I think this is the most unfair to the tax payer. I do appreciate the sheer volume of training Union members receive but know first hand that OJT is where the real experience is gained. However, there was one job where a private contractor brought in \u201cillegals?\u201d by the bus load and the whole job site went to crap very quickly.",

It's just not right and everybody knows it -- it's just not right when the average CEO makes $10,000 more every day...than what the average worker makes every year.\u201d he said. The vice president noted that the administration is determined to see that taxpayer dollars \"go to something other than union-busting activities.\u201d He mentioned the stimulus package, which will funnel taxpayer dollars to union jobs: \"The focus of this administration the first month has been to rebuild American roads, bridges, waterways -- jobs for the building trades union. Investing and getting more people access to broadband -- communication workers. Creating clean energy economy -- jobs that require electrical workers to modernize the grid, steel workers to go out and build the wind turbines, laborers to install the solar panels. Making our communities safer, jobs that require getting cops on the beat and keeping firefighters in firehouses. That's what we're trying to do.\" He also mentioned investment in schools (teachers unions). <edit> According to Biden, the nation's policy -- as expressed in the National Labor Relations Act -- is to \"encourage collective bargaining, encourage unions.\" He said it's not enough for corporations and government to \"tolerate\" workers forming unions -- \"after using every trick in the book\" to block them. Biden reassured labor leaders that he and President Barack Obama agree, \"You can't have a strong middle class without a strong labor movement.\" And Biden repeated that he and Obama will judge the success or failure of their administration on whether the middle class standard of living has increased during their first term. Biden described teachers, police officers, firefighters, hospital workers and factory workers are the \"nation's heart and soul.\" And while bankers and financiers are \"necessary,\" \"they are not the spine of the system,\" he said. Biden says the middle class has been \"slipping\" in recent years because the \u201csocial contract\u201d is out of balance. When productivity goes up, the people responsible for that productivity are supposed to benefit. That\u2019s the \u201cdeal,\u201d he said: \u201cWe don't want chief executives and wealthy people not to get wealthy. That's okay by us. Every one of us hope our kids end up there some day.\u201d But Biden said the deal involves workers getting a piece of the higher profits generated by their labor: \u201cWhile a company\u2019s management may come up with a good idea, workers \u201chelp make it happen\u2026we do things faster and better and cheaper for you so the profit margin increases -- the deal was we get a piece of that. We get a piece of it -- a fair piece. That's the bargain.\u201d Biden added that workers who helped boost productivity in recent years have seen the value of their incomes drop. \"For too long the middle class has been dealt out. I'm here to tell you in this administration it is dealt in. It is the first card on the table.\" <edit> In a plug for the Employee Free Choice Act, Biden said the unions aren't asking for anything they don't deserve: \"We just want to level this playing field again.\" The Employee Free Choice Act, also known as the card-check bill, would require the government to certify a union after 51 percent of workers have openly signed a card saying they want to unionize. The measure would effectively eliminate secret ballot union elections, critics warn. \"I have a simple, basic belief, one that we're going to work hard to put into action: If a union is what you want, a union you're entitled to have,\" Biden said.

The assault on the secret ballot is repugnant to any sense of decency and should be renounced and repudiated. To do otherwise simply surrenders our birthrights as Americans. Sounds like VP meeting with oil executives. Perhaps, but at least his party could be voted out office via the secret ballot. If current VP has his way that may no longer be an option.

        "content": "All unions are not created equal. The building trades is a good example of this. There is a good balance in the building trades that could not exist without unions. Some of you may know that construction is not a steady industry. A company will get a project that lasts a year and may get a handful of projects here and there for the following year. It would not be cost effective to keep the same labor force in that second year as that big project that took place the year prior. In this case, the employer lays off the workers that it doesn't need. Then those workers go to their Union hall to sign the out of work list. Usually, within a week, they are put on another project with another employer. Problem solved. Also, since the union does all of the training and certification, the companies do not need to pay to train (most training funds are funding from employee wages, not their benefits package). And, when employers bid jobs, labor is extremely easy to calculate because the wages are standardized per region and in line with the agreement that the union has made with all of the union contractors in that particular region. On the flipside of that, let's say that a relatively small company that typically does 20 man projects finally gets a really BIG project like a stadium or something similar that requires roughly 300 trained and certified tradesmen (Laborers, Ironworkers, Pipefitters, Carpenters, Operators, etc). Obviously, that company does not have that many employees already and finding that many tradesmen that are certified and trained through the classifieds will probably yield much smaller numbers than what is required for the job. This is a simple fix in union projects: All the employer has to do is call the union halls for each trade and request the number of tradesmen they need. Problem solved. As for the pay, what most Construction Craft Tradesmen make is not as much as you may think. Plus, many of them are skilled workers and do extremely dangerous work. For instance, take an Ironworker who has to do 8000 hous of OJT as well as 1000 hours of classroom training before he gets Journeyman status. The majority of his days are spent many feet above ground, walking on beams that are 4\" to 8\" wide. That is 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week, every week. Many times, the only way for him to get from one level to the other is to climb the iron to the next level. If he is not trained in the proper techniques of welding and connecting steel, blueprint reading, and structural integrity measure, that building could collapse years in the future. Plus, ironworkers do not wear a harness when they are walking the iron because it is actually increases the danger of the job. Would you say that $24 an hour is paying this guy too much? If so, then you are nuts! Or, let's look at a Construction Craft Laborer. This guy must do 4000 hours of OJT and 500 hours of classroom training to get Journeyman status. This is probably some of the most grueling and dangerous work you will find in construction. Not only do these guys to all the environmental remediation (asbestos removal, HAZMAT removal, Radioactive waste removal, etc), they also do all of the demolition projects (explosive demo, controlled demo, refractory demo, etc). That means that a Laborer will spend much of his days behind a pnuematic hammer/mut, climbing structures at great height, working with highly dangerous materials, cutting steal structure at great height (aka, high burning), working inside steel manufacturing furnaces and ovens in temps up to 150 degrees, etc. Many of these guys bodies are completely broken when they finally retire at 55-60. Is $20 an hour too much for this guy? If so, then you are nuts. The simple fact is, unless you have a college degree or you have a skill, you shouldn't be making $50,000 a year. But, if you have a skill (such as a tradesman) or a degree, you have earned that $50,000 a year. You have paid your dues, so to speak. Now, the UAW, Teamsters, Grocery workers, etc. Yeah, those are problems. They are paying people massive amounts of money to do something that a chimp could do. But, for people who have no idea what they are talking about to lump in every union in America together and think that they operate the same way is just ignorant. Also, keep in mind that the Building Tradesmen do not get holiday pay, sick pay, etc. If they don't work, they don't get paid.",

What I did see as a non-union worker working next to the union worker was non-unions were harassed and put in danger by the union workers.

Non-unions ran circles around the unions on every job that I was on because we had to. There were other jobs waiting on us which drove us. I did not see a difference in quality. Both can be poor or good , but when a good empowered inspector was on the site quality was high. However, a private companies very reputation is on the line and our owners were up our rears making sure the customer got what they paid for. Other than the deliberate endangerment and harassment I do not care. If the customer wants to pay for it then it is on them.

If they all contribute toward a lawyer/s it would be a one time fee, until the said contract is up in say four or five years. Therefore, there is no union dues to pay every week. To break it down, say there is 60 workers at a plant. They each contribute $15 a week to union dues. So each month they all contribute $3600 for dues. So for the year it adds up to $43,200. Times that by say, four years until the contract is up and that equals $172,800 in dues. Those people would not spend anywhere near that for a lawyer/s to negotiate a contract every four years. If they hire a lawyer at say $250 an hour for two weeks it would cost $20,000. For a month it would cost $40,000. It would cost $666 for each worker ($12 a week for only one year) once every four years. So that would net a savings of $132,800 (if $40,000 was needed for the lawyer).",
