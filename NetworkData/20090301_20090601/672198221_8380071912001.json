The money will come from the disposal of a dozen or so buildings around the capital and is needed to meet a budgetary bow wave from equipment deliveries falling due in the next couple of years. \"Financial estimates are going on,\" Morin told a press conference when asked about the amount from property sales. \"Between 800 million to 1 billion euros\" is expected, he said. At the Sept. 26 presentation of the 2009 defense budget, the figure of 1 billion euros was given for property divestments, topped up with 600 million euros from the sale of radio frequencies for the start of digital television broadcast. The properties will be sold to a holding company, Sovafim, owned by state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations, which will pay the MoD. The buildings will be sold into the commercial market over time. The ministry is in negotiations on the sale terms, such as a share in any gains on resale. The sales are part of a large-scale plan to build new headquarters, dubbed the \"French Pentagon,\" at the Balard site on the southwestern edge of the capital, bringing together under one roof the MoD; chiefs of staff of the Air Force, Army and Navy; the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour l'Armement (DGA) procurement office; and the S\u00e9cretariat G\u00e9nerale pour l'Administration, the administrative arm.

Charles de Gaulle on the liberation of Paris in 1944, will be kept in state ownership, as will the elegant naval building, which faces the Place de la Concorde.
