        "content": "\"Do you have any funny or amusing stories\" ??? Man! My life seems like an endless series of funny stories (with a few \"real world\" serious episodes/events thrown in), especially my \"courting\" years. In fact, while stationed in Germany, 6/63-6/65, a German friend of mine insisted my last name derives from a German word, \"schwanke\" which he defined as \"funny story\" (that's ok, though, his name was Nagel so I called him Herr Nail). Anyway, \"funny\" is in the \"eye of the beholder\" and most tales end up being I-guess-you-just-had-to-be-there. Here's one of my favorites, I'm sure I posted some time ago but you asked for it: One day in the winter 1964/65 I and two other grunts were making a run of some sort to, I believe, B Battery, 1/67 ADA. On the miles long climb up a mountain, we saw a semi truck off to the side of the snow-covered road. The closer we got, the more convinced we became that the driver was having trouble. He was digging with a shovel at his tires. When I got close enough to see that the truck was a Heineken beer truck, I had to pull off to see what's up. Sure enough, the truck was hung up because of the ice and snow, could not get traction to even get started out onto the road. After learning from the Dutch (from the Neatherlands) driver that, yes, he would accept any help we had to offer (he and I both spoke enough German to get on), we all looked over the situation, I pulled around to the front of the bier semi and hooked up a tow chain from the semi to our deuce-and-a-half, 6X6, M109 shop van. It was my truck but for some reason we selected Rush to drive while (God, I can't recall his name! I'll call him Fred until I remember or am told better) Fred and I shoveled cinders under drive wheels on both trucks. I told Rush that, if he got moving, keep moving. Fred and I would hitch a ride somehow. Well, I already knew what we would do. Sure enough, the trucks spun then grabbed a bite and slowly lumbered onto the asphalt surface. Fred and I threw our shovels into the cinder box behind the semi tractor and I grabbed a hand hold onto the rear of the trailer while Fred tried to jog along to keep up. I told him it was a long run to the top and he had better grab on. Let me explain a little here. Back in Worms, when all the APC's were gone from the motor pool, off on their winter manouvers, one of our favorite sports was grabbing onto a vehicle's back bumper and skiing just on the soles of our GI boots. Worked great! I still don't see any real danger in it but we cought hell after the honchos saw all the tire and ski tracks in the snow. However, this day, all that goof-off practice paid off. Fred finally decided that I was right, he would not be able to run the whole way up the mountain, so he tried my way. He did pretty good for about half the distance but, for some reason, he wasn't happy with the arrangement. He saw ahead of us that the road made a long, gentle swing, circling around a small medow-like area. (All under snow, of course. No way to tell how deep the snow or how treacherous the terrain). But he decided to run across that open area and catch up with the cab of, at least, one of the trucks. I tried to discourage him but he wouldn't be talked out of trying it. Well, he did give it a go. He was soon waist-deep in snow. He, sure he had absolutely no chance to pull off his scheme, wallowed his way BACK his trail, then had to run like mad to catch us up again. The rest of the way up the hill, he alternated between skiing and jogging, all the while, cussing me for my hair-brained idea. I don't know what his problem was. I was having a great time. I could stand and slide or even squat down and slide. It was a piece a cake to move to either side of the truck for a new view. I was a pro boot skier. About that time, I noticed, way behind us, an Army jeep was climbing the hill and closing. For some reason, this panicked Fred. Maybe he thought he he would be run over. \"Relax, Fred. We've only got another mile or so. We'll be there in a couple of minutes\". The approaching jeep closed slowly, having to negotiate the same conditions we had. It was entertaining to watch it rounding bends, occasionally fishing a little. Eventually, the jeep was right on our 6 and pulling to the left to pass our very slow-moving circus act. It wasn't until the jeep drew nearly along side that I could see that it was a grunt driver driving a captain. Well, what was I to do? I stood up skiing backward while holding on with one hand and whipped him the snappiest salute of my Army life. I didn't know what to expect. Would he interfere right then and hang us up again just when we were so close to the top? Would he wait for us at the top to rip us? It's anticlimatic but he did neither. We reached the top uneventfully and there was no mad captain there to greet us. Maybe he simply didn't believe what he had just seen...a couple of SP-4's hanging onto the tail of a beer truck, skiing up a mountain in the middle of Germany, all being towed by a deuce-an-a-half. The Dutchman tried to pay us but we refused his money offer. It was our pleasure to help. He did give us a carton of Heineken for our trouble... ...just another day in the life of a GI in Germany, serving...",

The day before it had rained quite a bit so there was flooding on this part of the road. At a very big flood on the road (two lanes in each direction), the traffic was merging into the left lane because the flood wasn\u2019t as deep. Each car took turns driving through the flood and traffic was keeping a slow but steady pace. Then, there was this idiot woman in front of me who started to drive through the flood and halfway through, in the deepest part, she decided to apply her brakes. DUHHHHH Well, you guessed it, she stalled and couldn\u2019t restart. Cars were honking, people were getting PO\u2019d. I was in a truck, so I put it in 2nd gear, revved my engine, let off the clutch and began to drive through the deeper right lane. Well, I started to create the mother of all Tsunamis, a virtual wall of water that rose above and seemed to totally engulf this woman\u2019s car. Now, do you remember when I said that it was a hot summer day? All of her windows were open and sitting in the back seat were a baby and two children with another kid in the front seat. They all had their baths early that day and I am sure that to this day, the inside of her car is still drying out. I laugh about this every time I think about it; the look of sheer terror on their faces when they saw the water coming straight at them. If I were to run in to her today, I would ask her; \u201cWTF were you thinking? Why in the name of everything holy, did you hit your brakes?\u201d",
