Asingle span over a surface roasway. Over a decade to complete. In the same period on Rt-13 down the Delmarva Peninsula, across the Chesapeak Bay Bridge thru VA Beach and south were completely repaved, an overpass built a bridge built, and 22 miles of 2 lane causeway on the Chesapeak Bay completed. Hmmm, a 50 ' overpass in NY, over 80 miles of roadway, an overpass,a bridge, 22 miles of causeway in VA, Same time frame....NY needs more money,,,why? I'm thinking CURRUPTION. i'M tired of supporting curruption. I'm opposed to throwing more money at people who sabotaged the Shoreham Nuclear power plant. The unelected Gov. shows no sign of being interested in reforming the curruption, only in collecting more tax. MORE, since I was a child, there has been an effort to get a real, COMPLETE financial statment out of the MTA .Where does all that toll money, subway and bus fairs , and other fees and emoluments go? They never say exactly. So, before we give them still more money, let's have a real accounting. How can these people mention fare share tax reform, without first looking at the abuse of the budget? They should be protesting for budgetary reform. The same people that cooked the MTA's budget....are still there. When ridership increased 40%..where did the money go? When Bloomberg increased property taxes, where did the money go? The MTA is crying poverty and threatening fare hikes and service cuts. This is all while cooking the books, and abusing taxpayer money. If they want to be fiscally irresponsible on the taxpayers dime, maybe it needs to come to an end. If they threatened to privatize the MTA, I do think you would start seeing the surpluses. \"A clear message should be sent. If you can not manage your budget, and keep abusing taxpayer money, then we will find more competent people to run the MTA.\" Instead of funding the MTA through taxpayer money, which has been abused for way too long, there would be tax revenue generated, and the burden of the taxpayer funding the operation would be eliminated. It would free up more money for the city, and generate new revenue through the taxes collected. New York and Atlantic Railway could be a contender for the LIRR and subway lines. There are a host of other companies like Norfolk southern, UNP, and others that can also step in. SUNLINER, thank you for bringing up cap and trade. That will affect 100% of taxpayers. Don't forget the GWPRA, and carbon taxes they are proposing on top of the Cap and Trade Scam. When the CE Queens plant was converted to coal, the resulting cost savings in the first 8 days of operation covered the cost of the conversion, and, if allowed to continue to operate would have slashed New Yorkers energy bills tremendously. The conversion included a host of environmental controls, and brand new high efficiency EP's by way of Wheelabrator. I was watching the news one day and they were talking about investigating companies to find out why NY pays such high energy costs, while other states pay half of what NY pays per KW hr.

Asingle span over a surface roasway. Over a decade to complete. In the same period on Rt-13 down the Delmarva Peninsula, across the Chesapeak Bay Bridge thru VA Beach and south were completely repaved, an overpass built a bridge built, and 22 miles of 2 lane causeway on the Chesapeak Bay completed. Hmmm, a 50 ' overpass in NY, over 80 miles of roadway, an overpass,a bridge, 22 miles of causeway in VA, Same time frame....NY needs more money,,,why? I'm thinking CURRUPTION. i'M tired of supporting curruption. I'm opposed to throwing more money at people who sabotaged the Shoreham Nuclear power plant. The unelected Gov. shows no sign of being interested in reforming the curruption, only in collecting more tax. MORE, since I was a child, there has been an effort to get a real, COMPLETE financial statment out of the MTA .Where does all that toll money, subway and bus fairs , and other fees and emoluments go? They never say exactly. So, before we give them still more money, let's have a real accounting.",

The same people that cooked the MTA's budget....are still there. When ridership increased 40%..where did the money go? When Bloomberg increased property taxes, where did the money go? The MTA is crying poverty and threatening fare hikes and service cuts. This is all while cooking the books, and abusing taxpayer money. If they want to be fiscally irresponsible on the taxpayers dime, maybe it needs to come to an end. If they threatened to privatize the MTA, I do think you would start seeing the surpluses. \"A clear message should be sent. If you can not manage your budget, and keep abusing taxpayer money, then we will find more competent people to run the MTA.\" Instead of funding the MTA through taxpayer money, which has been abused for way too long, there would be tax revenue generated, and the burden of the taxpayer funding the operation would be eliminated. It would free up more money for the city, and generate new revenue through the taxes collected. New York and Atlantic Railway could be a contender for the LIRR and subway lines. There are a host of other companies like Norfolk southern, UNP, and others that can also step in. SUNLINER, thank you for bringing up cap and trade. That will affect 100% of taxpayers. Don't forget the GWPRA, and carbon taxes they are proposing on top of the Cap and Trade Scam. When the CE Queens plant was converted to coal, the resulting cost savings in the first 8 days of operation covered the cost of the conversion, and, if allowed to continue to operate would have slashed New Yorkers energy bills tremendously.

The subways were sold to the City for the simple reason that private enterprise was unable to run them at a profit. This is the same reason that Amtrak exists. Private enterprise could not run passenger trains at a profit. Expecting them to take it over, ain't gonna happen. But theres a deeper problem. When the City took over the trains they did so by floating non repayable tax free bonds. These bonds were purchased by the same people who owned the subways in the first place. So, for the last eighty years or so they have been collecting the interest on these tax free bonds. Something over 35 Billion dollars, last time I checked. In other words, it's a form of Socialism for the rich. Dave",
