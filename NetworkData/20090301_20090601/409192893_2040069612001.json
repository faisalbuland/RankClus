Many USA gangs have went from small protective street gangs to international gangs. MS-13 has over 30,000 members in over a dozen country's they rival cartels in many senses. The crips and bloods have spread throughout the USA like a wild fire out of control. Many of these gangs openly target other gang members only to end up killing a person who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Many gangs control there turf as if its there own little nation. They smuggle weapons and drugs and people. They kill cops, city officials and other. They do millions of dollars in damages. So the point being in today's world should gangs be consider terrorist organizations and should they be treated as such under United States law?

So they must use gangs. Which the money they make selling it on the street goes back to Afghanistan to fund the Taliban and AQ in there war of jihad around the world. also the drug trade funds the arms going to cartels around the world. Which we have to send troops to support the fight against them. In the end they are supporting terrorist. because they are trying to bring down a government we support by mostly using terror to do it.",

In the USA there are over 20,000 gangs,with over 1 million members. Many USA gangs have went from small protective street gangs to international gangs. MS-13 has over 30,000 members in over a dozen country's they rival cartels in many senses. The crips and bloods have spread throughout the USA like a wild fire out of control. Many of these gangs openly target other gang members only to end up killing a person who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Many gangs control there turf as if its there own little nation. They smuggle weapons and drugs and people. They kill cops, city officials and other. They do millions of dollars in damages. So the point being in today's world should gangs be consider terrorist organizations and should they be treated as such under United States law? No. I believe that we have enough laws under which to prosecute violent multiple felons which make up the vast majority of gang members. What additional measures do you hope would be used against gangs if they were considered terrorists? Predator UAVs launching hellfire missiles at large drug buys? Or perhaps a couple JDAMS dropped on em by a F-16 if they were beyond city limits? Treating criminal gangs as terrorist organizations is completely unnecessary. in today's world it might be a necessary evil. the laws We have for gangs aren't willing working as well. since more gangs are being created and becoming bigger. Terrorist law's would able the law enforcement to do a lot more right now then they could with out it. gangs aren't just streets now many are rivaling the mafia,cartels and other groups including terrorist. the only difference being terrorist groups and gangs are the ideas.",

Let everyone exchange them for 101 dollar bills in 30-60 days or lose them. That would create quite a cost for them trying to get rid of all that drug money. To say nothing of the tax evaders who have money vaulted and would have to account where it came from. Thats why it will never happen to many politicians and other wheeler dealers would lose to much they cant show.",
