I make myself watch both sides to keep it balanced and if you have to watch the hard left radicals you might as well get a laugh at the same time. I have to say he has made fun of Obama too, not as much as Bush and the Reps of course but pretty much anything goes with him. His panel is always one sided and so I can't take it too seriously much like I can't take the View too seriously. I also throw in Fox, CNN, John Stewart and GMA so that about covers all sides, yes? Anyway, I don't like anyone who talks trash about my military and you better know I let people know it. You know - like I tell everyone else, if you look for facts, you don't have to worry about keeping things \"balanced\". Any clown can have an opinion. But if you get ahold of the facts, you can rely on your own judgment.",

I doubt they believe in half the dribble they spill forth. It is about ratings and appealing to those extremists and people who believe everything they read and hear. They have to out do each other to grab the limelight. It amazes me that people watch these shows, and what is more amazing is when people say they hate this person and they heard him say this and that. If I don't like someone on TV, I just don't tune in to that person. You now have another character Beck LOL. They must all be reading from the same character scripts.",
