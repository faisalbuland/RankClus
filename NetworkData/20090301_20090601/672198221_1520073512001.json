Even if you control government, you cannot interfere with tribals. Pakistan for example is not a single country. In 1947, two regions (Sindh and Punjab) forced their way to get a 100% Islamic country. They included Baluchistan, NWFP and by 1948 attacked and occupied Kashmir. Tribals of those states were bribed and kept under control. Best way to change the society is to educate the females. Once females are educated in tribal belts they will start checking their own families and eliminate the extremist factor. Simultaneously, win the confidence of tribals and their leaders. If all the tribal leaders are with US Army, government of those countries will be helpless. Tribal people have strong belief that they have to protect their guest over their lives. Guest for them could be from any region/religion. Question is winning confidence which is not possible with guns alone. Politicians in this part of the world are so corrupt that they have lost the track of their own swiss bank accounts!!",
