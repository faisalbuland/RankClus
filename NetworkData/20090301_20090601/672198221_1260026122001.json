The court's ruling came after the girl, bothered by conscience or something, made a statement to the effect that she might have had more to do with the incident than she had previously indicated. The fact that her geographical, as well as her temporal and moral perspective had changed probably has nothing to do with her statement. It was made in America, to which she has emigrated. Some of our more knowledgeable posters indicated that Subic girls often did this kind of thing for economic gain. Guess they were right. The corporal's timely withdrawal has, however, raised some Philippino ire. Maybe they can hook-up for a make-up!",

The corporal's timely withdrawal has, however, raised some Philippino ire. Maybe they can hook-up for a make-up! From day 1 it was BS. She was in the van with the Marine going at it and the other Marines and girls made fun of them, humiliated then cried rape. I dont think she getting to the states had anything to do with it. I am curious as to how she got here though.Most people come to America for economic gain, whether they are German or Filipino. And marriage is another dynamic. Did she get married and come here? Did she apply for a visa? My question is if she is not married how did she get here? Currently there is a 20yr backlog to come here and that is if a family member petitions. And the 40yr sentence was bs to even if he was guilty. He would have rcvd a sentence 3 times what a Filipino would have rcvd.",

Sadly every false report detracts something from real ones. I don't have the slightest clue what happen to this marine. If he was innocent than I'm delighted he's been freed. However I've been a police officer and police supervisor for more years than many here have been alive. I do know it's not unusual for a trauma victim to forgive her assailant and try to get him released after the conviction and imprisonment. Some call it the hostage-syndrome. Sometimes a victim partially blames herself for the assault, but it happens more times than I care for. The truth should've been dealt with during a careful investigation and before an arrest. I'm sure insiders to this investigation know more than what I'm suggesting. Maybe gross incompetence or political pressure had something to do with it. In public service we can handle these pressures better than military circles where ranks and positions are more fragile.",
