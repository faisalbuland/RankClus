If anyone does know Solis background they wouldnt be surprised Labor Secretary Says Making Sure Undocumented Workers Get Paid Will Be Priority Wednesday, April 29, 2009 By Victor Epstein, Associated Press 'http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=47381' Paramus, N.J. (AP) - Ensuring undocumented workers get paid and improving worker safety are two priorities for the Department of Labor, its first Hispanic secretary said Wednesday. Hilda Solis visited a green jobs event in northern New Jersey, where she said unpaid wages will continue to be a problem for day laborers until comprehensive immigration reform is undertaken at the federal level. But she cautioned that stabilizing the economy and health care reform must come first for President Barack Obama's administration. Day laborers, many of them Hispanic, are sometimes denied payment and are afraid to press for wages when they're in the country illegally. Solis, who took office Feb. 24, said she takes this \"very seriously.\" Thats the chance they take for being here illegally,They can go home. \"We're going to have people going out in the field and investigating,\" Solis said, noting that she differs from her predecessor, Elaine Chao, in this approach. \"We're going to be more robust in this area and also with respect to OSHA.\"Yeh spend taxpayer to make sure illegals get paid. Meanwhile your nitwit counterpart in DHS doesnt investigate Illegals or enforece squat <edit> Solis spoke privately with a group of local Hispanic leaders, including Perth Amboy Mayor Wilda Diaz, about workplace safety before the event. \"In terms of Latinos in the work force, we're probably the ones that are faced with the most fatalities and injuries,\" Solis told them, citing the many Hispanics in the construction industry. Hispanics are 20% of construction but they get injured more than anyone else, why? Solis said the national discussion of comprehensive immigration reform will begin this summer. She said goals include eliminating the underground economy that has sprouted up around illegal workers and preventing the separation of families that include children who are U.S. citizens and others who have not been granted legal entry. Via La Raza~! We knew it was coming Solis and New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine toured the Paramus training academy of Local 164 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which offers instruction in solar panel and wind turbine installation. Solis lauded Corzine for his leadership role in increasing solar array installations in New Jersey and in pursuing federal funds for the unemployed. New Jersey's master energy plan calls for the creation of 20,000 green jobs by 2020. Unemployment in the Garden State rose for the 14th straight month in March to 8.2 percent, less than the U.S. rate of 8.5 percent. \"The most important thing we have to do is lift the overall economy because a rising tide lifts all boats,\" Corzine said. Solis and Corzine also met with seven unemployed workers. Solis told them that green jobs and the health care and IT industries will be leaders in job creation in coming years. The workers told them that it's hard to make ends meet with an unemployment check in New Jersey because of the high cost of living. The median household income for a family of four in New Jersey is $94,441, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Solis is at least the second high-level member of the Obama administration in the past month to appear with Corzine, who trailed Republican gubernatorial challenger Chris Christie in a Monmouth University/Gannett New Jersey poll released Wednesday. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson held a news conference with Corzine on ship pollution March 30 in Newark.",

But then you go on and contradict yourself. Our justice system is... they are to be deported immediately AFTER they have been screened to ensure they are not wanted for crimes. I guess we should use the super secret double probation option on them. I actually concur with what Pres Bush did for one reason. I reflected on the day that Elian Gonzales was basically ripped from his families arms to be sent back to Cuba. The picture of the ATF dude in full battle rattle with an MP-5 up close and personal...He was doing what he was ordered to do but... I was not proud of our country that day. To suddenly deport 20 million would be a replay of that scene again and again with the kids caught in the middle. I am all for business but I do not ever support American business using illegals. If they showed due process to determine legal status then they are blameless. If not or knowingly promote the highering of illegals they should be fined. Not draconian the first couple of times but enough to make them think. As the fines increase no more illegals hired. But the government has to help to ensure they are not illegal. To have the fines reset back to zero the company would have to be spectacular for a while. I also want a guest worker program...all that juicy tax money to be had with the knowledge of who the heck the people are. The Soviets tried a fence patrolled by dogs that would shred a human with but one word. Guard posts every so often with some as I am told having liquid cooled machine guns mounted. Then continual roving armed guards with AK's. A lot of \"Papers please\". Still people got through. We need to control the flow and we have to remove the handouts as best we can to reduce by a huge number the illegals. If we got 19 million to go home and 1 million are left that is a pretty good start....-IMHO",

For example in many of the raids they would check only the shift coming off work and not the shift arriving at work and VERY little has been done to the employers. Also the Bush admin stonewalled for years on implementing a LEGAL and usable worker verification system.",

If anyone does know Solis background they wouldnt be surprised Labor Secretary Says Making Sure Undocumented Workers Get Paid Will Be Priority Wednesday, April 29, 2009 By Victor Epstein, Associated Press 'http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=47381' Paramus, N.J. (AP) - Ensuring undocumented workers get paid and improving worker safety are two priorities for the Department of Labor, its first Hispanic secretary said Wednesday. Hilda Solis visited a green jobs event in northern New Jersey, where she said unpaid wages will continue to be a problem for day laborers until comprehensive immigration reform is undertaken at the federal level. But she cautioned that stabilizing the economy and health care reform must come first for President Barack Obama's administration. Day laborers, many of them Hispanic, are sometimes denied payment and are afraid to press for wages when they're in the country illegally. Solis, who took office Feb. 24, said she takes this \"very seriously.\" Thats the chance they take for being here illegally,They can go home. \"We're going to have people going out in the field and investigating,\" Solis said, noting that she differs from her predecessor, Elaine Chao, in this approach. \"We're going to be more robust in this area and also with respect to OSHA.\"Yeh spend taxpayer to make sure illegals get paid. Meanwhile your nitwit counterpart in DHS doesnt investigate Illegals or enforece squat <edit> Solis spoke privately with a group of local Hispanic leaders, including Perth Amboy Mayor Wilda Diaz, about workplace safety before the event. \"In terms of Latinos in the work force, we're probably the ones that are faced with the most fatalities and injuries,\" Solis told them, citing the many Hispanics in the construction industry. Hispanics are 20% of construction but they get injured more than anyone else, why? Solis said the national discussion of comprehensive immigration reform will begin this summer. She said goals include eliminating the underground economy that has sprouted up around illegal workers and preventing the separation of families that include children who are U.S. citizens and others who have not been granted legal entry. Via La Raza~! We knew it was coming Solis and New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine toured the Paramus training academy of Local 164 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which offers instruction in solar panel and wind turbine installation. Solis lauded Corzine for his leadership role in increasing solar array installations in New Jersey and in pursuing federal funds for the unemployed. New Jersey's master energy plan calls for the creation of 20,000 green jobs by 2020. Unemployment in the Garden State rose for the 14th straight month in March to 8.2 percent, less than the U.S. rate of 8.5 percent. \"The most important thing we have to do is lift the overall economy because a rising tide lifts all boats,\" Corzine said. Solis and Corzine also met with seven unemployed workers. Solis told them that green jobs and the health care and IT industries will be leaders in job creation in coming years. The workers told them that it's hard to make ends meet with an unemployment check in New Jersey because of the high cost of living. The median household income for a family of four in New Jersey is $94,441, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Solis is at least the second high-level member of the Obama administration in the past month to appear with Corzine, who trailed Republican gubernatorial challenger Chris Christie in a Monmouth University/Gannett New Jersey poll released Wednesday. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson held a news conference with Corzine on ship pollution March 30 in Newark.",

But then you go on and contradict yourself. Our justice system is... they are to be deported immediately AFTER they have been screened to ensure they are not wanted for crimes.

To suddenly deport 20 million would be a replay of that scene again and again with the kids caught in the middle. I am all for business but I do not ever support American business using illegals. If they showed due process to determine legal status then they are blameless. If not or knowingly promote the highering of illegals they should be fined. Not draconian the first couple of times but enough to make them think. As the fines increase no more illegals hired. But the government has to help to ensure they are not illegal. To have the fines reset back to zero the company would have to be spectacular for a while.

The Soviets tried a fence patrolled by dogs that would shred a human with but one word. Guard posts every so often with some as I am told having liquid cooled machine guns mounted. Then continual roving armed guards with AK's. A lot of \"Papers please\". Still people got through. We need to control the flow and we have to remove the handouts as best we can to reduce by a huge number the illegals.

        "reply": " I disagree. Name a few, please? Under the CLINTON administration, I saw MANY raids on illegal camps in my San Diego County town. The Border Patrol was constantly closing off streets to enact these. It was a pain in the ass, and I'd have to drive an extra three or four miles to get home. But the law was being enforced, so I sucked it up. Under Bush: nothing. ZERO. ZILCH. So far under Obama: nothing. ZERO. ZILCH. Time will tell.",

It's not being enforced by the new administration Did the Bush administration treat this issue any differently, really? Yes, they started to crack down on companies that hired them. Still the Bush Admin didn't do nearly enough either. New Administration now wants them all to become legal. Where are the trade unions in all of this mess? Don't they have ANY clout anymore? Not in right to work states, to which a lot of the border states near Mexico are. BS the Bush admin did a few SHOW raids but they did not really crack down on companies. For example in many of the raids they would check only the shift coming off work and not the shift arriving at work and VERY little has been done to the employers. Also the Bush admin stonewalled for years on implementing a LEGAL and usable worker verification system. Why are you directing this towards me? I CLEARLY WROTE BUSH DIDN'T DO ENOUGH. Is it because of my comment about the current administration? If so, need to get over it because it's true, they aren't doing a thing about it. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?\" - Joseph Stalin",
