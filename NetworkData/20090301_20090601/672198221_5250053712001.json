After more than two years as a senior manufacturing test engineer for the San Carlos, Calif.-based firm, he wondered why at age 51 he got a pink slip but his co-workers, all under 40, didn\u2019t. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to realign the whole organization to be younger, trying to green up the engineers,\u201d he said. A Tesla Motors spokeswoman denied the allegations, but Bongers suspects he was discriminated against. He\u2019s not alone. Discrimination claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission jumped 15 percent in fiscal 2008 to 95,402 \u2014 the highest level since the agency opened in 1965, said spokesman David Grinberg. That is up from 82,792 claims filed the year before by workers who believe they were discriminated against because of age, race, religion, gender or other reasons. During tough economic times, discrimination claims tend to rise because more people are losing their jobs and searching for new ones. And it could get worse. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
