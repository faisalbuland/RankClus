The folk in that region haven't been shy about embracing western technology. They've been copying western patterns for centuries,and using them when necessary to perform the traditional Afghan colonic welcoming rite. Remember when they threatened to shut down the cell phone system last year, unless the government stopped trying to listen in on their communications? Think they don't do sigint, or know they're being monitored too?",
