        "content": "The Salt Lake City newspaper the Deseret News has published this report about a paper just published in the Chemical Physics Journal Tiny red and gray chips found in the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center contain highly explosive materials, according to a former BYU professor. Physicist Steven E. Jones, who retired from Brigham Young University in 2006 after the school recoiled from the controversy surrounding his 9/11 theories, is one of nine authors on a paper published last week in the online, peer-reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal. Also listed as authors are BYU physics professor Jeffrey Farrer and a professor of nanochemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. For several years, Jones has theorized that pre-positioned explosives, not fires from jet fuel, caused the rapid, symmetrical collapse of the two World Trade Center buildings, plus the collapse of a third building, WTC-7. The newest research, according to the journal authors, shows that dust from the collapsing towers contained a \"nano-thermite\" material that is highly explosive. Although the article draws no conclusions about the source and purpose of the explosives, Jones has previously supported a theory that the collapse of the WTC towers was part of a government conspiracy to ignore warnings about the 9/11 terrorists so that the attack would propel America to wage war against Afghanistan and Iraq. The next step, Jones said in a phone interview on Monday, is for someone to investigate \"who made the stuff and why it was there.\" A layer of dust lay over parts of Manhattan immediately following the collapse of the towers, and it was samples of this dust that Jones and fellow researchers requested in a 2006 paper, hoping to determine \"the whole truth of the events of that day.\" They eventually tested four samples they received from New Yorkers. One sample was from a man who had swept up a handful of dust on the Brooklyn Bridge, where he was walking when the second tower fell. As the journal authors note, \"It was, therefore, definitely not contaminated by the steel-cutting or clean-up operations at Ground Zero, which began later. Furthermore, it is not mixed with dust from WTC-7, which fell hours later.\" Another man collected dust in his apartment, about five blocks from the World Trade Center, on the morning of Sept. 12. There was a layer about an inch thick on a stack of folded laundry near an open window. Red/gray chips, averaging in size between .2 and 3 mm, were found in all four dust samples. The chips were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and other high-tech tools. The red layer of the chips, according to the researchers, contains a \"highly energetic\" form of thermite. While normal thermite (a mixture of finely granulated aluminum and an oxide of metal) can be incendiary, \"super thermite\" is explosive. He says there is no benign explanation for the thermite in the WTC dust. Jones made headlines in 2005 when he argued that the rapid and symmetrical fall of the World Trade Center looked like the result of pre-positioned explosives. He argued that fires alone wouldn't have been hot enough to crumble the buildings; and that even if struck by planes, the towers should have been strong enough to support the weight of the tops as they crumbled \u2014 unless they were leveled by explosives. Essentially forced to retire, Jones says he is now paying for research out of his own pocket. He likens himself to Galileo and Newton, who stood by their consciences. \"I would like to think I could stand up for the truth,\" he says. The dust study vindicates his earlier theories, Jones says, but he has mixed feelings about the implications. \"As a young student said to me a while back: 'It's exciting from a scientific point of view, because things are now making sense. But I feel sad for my country.'\u2009\" \"\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/0,5143,705295677,00.html This message has been edited. Last edited by: WitchitaKid, Sun 12 April 2009 05:31 PM",

So: I know which \"side\" to choose because societies or organisations of professionals do not endorse 9-11 theories, whose proponents represent an insignificant proportion of professionals in that field, and whose statements often involve distortion, inaccuracy, omission, fallacy and downright lies.",

        "content": "The Salt Lake City newspaper the Deseret News has published this report about a paper just published in the Chemical Physics Journal Tiny red and gray chips found in the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center contain highly explosive materials, according to a former BYU professor. Physicist Steven E. Jones, who retired from Brigham Young University in 2006 after the school recoiled from the controversy surrounding his 9/11 theories, is one of nine authors on a paper published last week in the online, peer-reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal. Also listed as authors are BYU physics professor Jeffrey Farrer and a professor of nanochemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. For several years, Jones has theorized that pre-positioned explosives, not fires from jet fuel, caused the rapid, symmetrical collapse of the two World Trade Center buildings, plus the collapse of a third building, WTC-7. The newest research, according to the journal authors, shows that dust from the collapsing towers contained a \"nano-thermite\" material that is highly explosive. Although the article draws no conclusions about the source and purpose of the explosives, Jones has previously supported a theory that the collapse of the WTC towers was part of a government conspiracy to ignore warnings about the 9/11 terrorists so that the attack would propel America to wage war against Afghanistan and Iraq. The next step, Jones said in a phone interview on Monday, is for someone to investigate \"who made the stuff and why it was there.\" A layer of dust lay over parts of Manhattan immediately following the collapse of the towers, and it was samples of this dust that Jones and fellow researchers requested in a 2006 paper, hoping to determine \"the whole truth of the events of that day.\" They eventually tested four samples they received from New Yorkers. One sample was from a man who had swept up a handful of dust on the Brooklyn Bridge, where he was walking when the second tower fell. As the journal authors note, \"It was, therefore, definitely not contaminated by the steel-cutting or clean-up operations at Ground Zero, which began later. Furthermore, it is not mixed with dust from WTC-7, which fell hours later.\" Another man collected dust in his apartment, about five blocks from the World Trade Center, on the morning of Sept. 12. There was a layer about an inch thick on a stack of folded laundry near an open window. Red/gray chips, averaging in size between .2 and 3 mm, were found in all four dust samples. The chips were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and other high-tech tools. The red layer of the chips, according to the researchers, contains a \"highly energetic\" form of thermite. While normal thermite (a mixture of finely granulated aluminum and an oxide of metal) can be incendiary, \"super thermite\" is explosive. He says there is no benign explanation for the thermite in the WTC dust. Jones made headlines in 2005 when he argued that the rapid and symmetrical fall of the World Trade Center looked like the result of pre-positioned explosives. He argued that fires alone wouldn't have been hot enough to crumble the buildings; and that even if struck by planes, the towers should have been strong enough to support the weight of the tops as they crumbled \u2014 unless they were leveled by explosives. Essentially forced to retire, Jones says he is now paying for research out of his own pocket. He likens himself to Galileo and Newton, who stood by their consciences. \"I would like to think I could stand up for the truth,\" he says. The dust study vindicates his earlier theories, Jones says, but he has mixed feelings about the implications. \"As a young student said to me a while back: 'It's exciting from a scientific point of view, because things are now making sense. But I feel sad for my country.'\u2009\" \"\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/0,5143,705295677,00.html This message has been edited. Last edited by: WitchitaKid, Sun 12 April 2009 05:31 PM",

Yea thats really an intelligent approach. I know you're not interested in anything except what supports your view, and it's a waste of time talking to you, but for the lurkers.... I can evaluate certain aspects myself, because I have expertise in those areas, but the rest? I look to the professionals who can evaluate such matters. When there appears to be a split in opinions, I look at how many professionals favour what theory. So it does become easy: if a qualified person does side with the truthers, you'll find they are in the overwhelming minority. Amongst pilot, engineers, etc, the average seem to be about 0.1% of the professional group believe in a 9-11 \"inside job\". You'll see no organisation of professionals endorses the truther theories.

        "content": "The Salt Lake City newspaper the Deseret News has published this report about a paper just published in the Chemical Physics Journal Tiny red and gray chips found in the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center contain highly explosive materials, according to a former BYU professor. Physicist Steven E. Jones, who retired from Brigham Young University in 2006 after the school recoiled from the controversy surrounding his 9/11 theories, is one of nine authors on a paper published last week in the online, peer-reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal. Also listed as authors are BYU physics professor Jeffrey Farrer and a professor of nanochemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. For several years, Jones has theorized that pre-positioned explosives, not fires from jet fuel, caused the rapid, symmetrical collapse of the two World Trade Center buildings, plus the collapse of a third building, WTC-7. The newest research, according to the journal authors, shows that dust from the collapsing towers contained a \"nano-thermite\" material that is highly explosive. Although the article draws no conclusions about the source and purpose of the explosives, Jones has previously supported a theory that the collapse of the WTC towers was part of a government conspiracy to ignore warnings about the 9/11 terrorists so that the attack would propel America to wage war against Afghanistan and Iraq. The next step, Jones said in a phone interview on Monday, is for someone to investigate \"who made the stuff and why it was there.\" A layer of dust lay over parts of Manhattan immediately following the collapse of the towers, and it was samples of this dust that Jones and fellow researchers requested in a 2006 paper, hoping to determine \"the whole truth of the events of that day.\" They eventually tested four samples they received from New Yorkers. One sample was from a man who had swept up a handful of dust on the Brooklyn Bridge, where he was walking when the second tower fell. As the journal authors note, \"It was, therefore, definitely not contaminated by the steel-cutting or clean-up operations at Ground Zero, which began later. Furthermore, it is not mixed with dust from WTC-7, which fell hours later.\" Another man collected dust in his apartment, about five blocks from the World Trade Center, on the morning of Sept. 12. There was a layer about an inch thick on a stack of folded laundry near an open window. Red/gray chips, averaging in size between .2 and 3 mm, were found in all four dust samples. The chips were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and other high-tech tools. The red layer of the chips, according to the researchers, contains a \"highly energetic\" form of thermite. While normal thermite (a mixture of finely granulated aluminum and an oxide of metal) can be incendiary, \"super thermite\" is explosive. He says there is no benign explanation for the thermite in the WTC dust. Jones made headlines in 2005 when he argued that the rapid and symmetrical fall of the World Trade Center looked like the result of pre-positioned explosives. He argued that fires alone wouldn't have been hot enough to crumble the buildings; and that even if struck by planes, the towers should have been strong enough to support the weight of the tops as they crumbled \u2014 unless they were leveled by explosives. Essentially forced to retire, Jones says he is now paying for research out of his own pocket. He likens himself to Galileo and Newton, who stood by their consciences. \"I would like to think I could stand up for the truth,\" he says. The dust study vindicates his earlier theories, Jones says, but he has mixed feelings about the implications. \"As a young student said to me a while back: 'It's exciting from a scientific point of view, because things are now making sense. But I feel sad for my country.'\u2009\" \"\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/0,5143,705295677,00.html This message has been edited. Last edited by: WitchitaKid, Sun 12 April 2009 05:31 PM",

When one full scale non partisan investigation comprised of proffesionals in every field examining every single piece of evidence and deposing every wittness, with unlimited supeona authority,would answer all the questions and reveal the truth. The longer it continues the more convinced I become that it was a massive conspiracy inside job and there are mass murderers at large that need to be brought to justice. All one has to ask themselves is, Why all the resistance to such an investigation? Time? cost? How can that even be considered in a case such as this. Its an opportunity to break the stangelhold that the political parties have on this nation and restore the power to the people. Government is answerable to the people, and that sham of an official 9/11 commission was an insult to anyone possesing a single brain cell leaving so many unanswered questions and division. Nothing can be more important than ensuring beyond a reasonable doubt, that our government was not complicit in any way and such is not the case.",

        "reply": " Thats all weve been doing for the last eight years, guessing. Isnt that something thats totally unbelievable? The most significant event in the history of our country and all we can do is speculate and make lame jokes? When one full scale non partisan investigation comprised of proffesionals in every field examining every single piece of evidence and deposing every wittness, with unlimited supeona authority,would answer all the questions and reveal the truth. The longer it continues the more convinced I become that it was a massive conspiracy inside job and there are mass murderers at large that need to be brought to justice. All one has to ask themselves is, Why all the resistance to such an investigation? Time? cost? How can that even be considered in a case such as this. Its an opportunity to break the stangelhold that the political parties have on this nation and restore the power to the people. Government is answerable to the people, and that sham of an official 9/11 commission was an insult to anyone possesing a single brain cell leaving so many unanswered questions and division. Nothing can be more important than ensuring beyond a reasonable doubt, that our government was not complicit in any way and such is not the case.",

As they talk on I sat there as a bump on a Log they talked about the theory of what did take down the towers because that was already in play by some Tab rags. They went on and on, but the one thing they did say, is that there were no outside causes for the towers to fail except the plane crashed into them. Do any of you understand a blast furness?

        "content": "The Salt Lake City newspaper the Deseret News has published this report about a paper just published in the Chemical Physics Journal Tiny red and gray chips found in the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center contain highly explosive materials, according to a former BYU professor. Physicist Steven E. Jones, who retired from Brigham Young University in 2006 after the school recoiled from the controversy surrounding his 9/11 theories, is one of nine authors on a paper published last week in the online, peer-reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal. Also listed as authors are BYU physics professor Jeffrey Farrer and a professor of nanochemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. For several years, Jones has theorized that pre-positioned explosives, not fires from jet fuel, caused the rapid, symmetrical collapse of the two World Trade Center buildings, plus the collapse of a third building, WTC-7. The newest research, according to the journal authors, shows that dust from the collapsing towers contained a \"nano-thermite\" material that is highly explosive. Although the article draws no conclusions about the source and purpose of the explosives, Jones has previously supported a theory that the collapse of the WTC towers was part of a government conspiracy to ignore warnings about the 9/11 terrorists so that the attack would propel America to wage war against Afghanistan and Iraq. The next step, Jones said in a phone interview on Monday, is for someone to investigate \"who made the stuff and why it was there.\" A layer of dust lay over parts of Manhattan immediately following the collapse of the towers, and it was samples of this dust that Jones and fellow researchers requested in a 2006 paper, hoping to determine \"the whole truth of the events of that day.\" They eventually tested four samples they received from New Yorkers. One sample was from a man who had swept up a handful of dust on the Brooklyn Bridge, where he was walking when the second tower fell. As the journal authors note, \"It was, therefore, definitely not contaminated by the steel-cutting or clean-up operations at Ground Zero, which began later. Furthermore, it is not mixed with dust from WTC-7, which fell hours later.\" Another man collected dust in his apartment, about five blocks from the World Trade Center, on the morning of Sept. 12. There was a layer about an inch thick on a stack of folded laundry near an open window. Red/gray chips, averaging in size between .2 and 3 mm, were found in all four dust samples. The chips were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and other high-tech tools. The red layer of the chips, according to the researchers, contains a \"highly energetic\" form of thermite. While normal thermite (a mixture of finely granulated aluminum and an oxide of metal) can be incendiary, \"super thermite\" is explosive. He says there is no benign explanation for the thermite in the WTC dust. Jones made headlines in 2005 when he argued that the rapid and symmetrical fall of the World Trade Center looked like the result of pre-positioned explosives. He argued that fires alone wouldn't have been hot enough to crumble the buildings; and that even if struck by planes, the towers should have been strong enough to support the weight of the tops as they crumbled \u2014 unless they were leveled by explosives. Essentially forced to retire, Jones says he is now paying for research out of his own pocket. He likens himself to Galileo and Newton, who stood by their consciences. \"I would like to think I could stand up for the truth,\" he says. The dust study vindicates his earlier theories, Jones says, but he has mixed feelings about the implications. \"As a young student said to me a while back: 'It's exciting from a scientific point of view, because things are now making sense. But I feel sad for my country.'\u2009\" \"\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/0,5143,705295677,00.html This message has been edited. Last edited by: WitchitaKid, Sun 12 April 2009 05:31 PM",

        "content": "The Salt Lake City newspaper the Deseret News has published this report about a paper just published in the Chemical Physics Journal Tiny red and gray chips found in the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center contain highly explosive materials, according to a former BYU professor. Physicist Steven E. Jones, who retired from Brigham Young University in 2006 after the school recoiled from the controversy surrounding his 9/11 theories, is one of nine authors on a paper published last week in the online, peer-reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal. Also listed as authors are BYU physics professor Jeffrey Farrer and a professor of nanochemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. For several years, Jones has theorized that pre-positioned explosives, not fires from jet fuel, caused the rapid, symmetrical collapse of the two World Trade Center buildings, plus the collapse of a third building, WTC-7. The newest research, according to the journal authors, shows that dust from the collapsing towers contained a \"nano-thermite\" material that is highly explosive. Although the article draws no conclusions about the source and purpose of the explosives, Jones has previously supported a theory that the collapse of the WTC towers was part of a government conspiracy to ignore warnings about the 9/11 terrorists so that the attack would propel America to wage war against Afghanistan and Iraq. The next step, Jones said in a phone interview on Monday, is for someone to investigate \"who made the stuff and why it was there.\" A layer of dust lay over parts of Manhattan immediately following the collapse of the towers, and it was samples of this dust that Jones and fellow researchers requested in a 2006 paper, hoping to determine \"the whole truth of the events of that day.\" They eventually tested four samples they received from New Yorkers. One sample was from a man who had swept up a handful of dust on the Brooklyn Bridge, where he was walking when the second tower fell. As the journal authors note, \"It was, therefore, definitely not contaminated by the steel-cutting or clean-up operations at Ground Zero, which began later. Furthermore, it is not mixed with dust from WTC-7, which fell hours later.\" Another man collected dust in his apartment, about five blocks from the World Trade Center, on the morning of Sept. 12. There was a layer about an inch thick on a stack of folded laundry near an open window. Red/gray chips, averaging in size between .2 and 3 mm, were found in all four dust samples. The chips were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and other high-tech tools. The red layer of the chips, according to the researchers, contains a \"highly energetic\" form of thermite. While normal thermite (a mixture of finely granulated aluminum and an oxide of metal) can be incendiary, \"super thermite\" is explosive. He says there is no benign explanation for the thermite in the WTC dust. Jones made headlines in 2005 when he argued that the rapid and symmetrical fall of the World Trade Center looked like the result of pre-positioned explosives. He argued that fires alone wouldn't have been hot enough to crumble the buildings; and that even if struck by planes, the towers should have been strong enough to support the weight of the tops as they crumbled \u2014 unless they were leveled by explosives. Essentially forced to retire, Jones says he is now paying for research out of his own pocket. He likens himself to Galileo and Newton, who stood by their consciences. \"I would like to think I could stand up for the truth,\" he says. The dust study vindicates his earlier theories, Jones says, but he has mixed feelings about the implications. \"As a young student said to me a while back: 'It's exciting from a scientific point of view, because things are now making sense. But I feel sad for my country.'\u2009\" \"\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/0,5143,705295677,00.html This message has been edited. Last edited by: WitchitaKid, Sun 12 April 2009 05:31 PM",

Then he and I went to NY NY to the 9-11 site and worked until Dec 9 . He worked on for a short time longer. This is why, when I see the all these new reports I get a little hot under the coller. MD So then why not dispell all the BS and put the issue to rest with a full blown comprehensive investigation? Just realize how many different conflicting reports have been issued over the years. If for no other reason than regaining credibility and exposing the nay sayers and thier reasons? When you have experts on both sides of the fence with direct opposite findings Some one has to be telling the truth and someone has to be lieing. The question we need answered is who? I am here to tell you I spent 6 years of my life in the construction of thoes bldgs and and know ever inch like the back of my hand am here to tell you,NFW did fire or airplane crashes take those bldgs down in exactly the same maner within hrs. But who would believe me same as who would believe your brother working for the Gov.? We both know only a real non partisan investigation will provide the truth.",
