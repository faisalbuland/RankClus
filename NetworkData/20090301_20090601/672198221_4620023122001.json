The deadline for Tigers supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran and his guerrillas would run out at midday (0630 GMT) Tuesday, said defence ministry spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella. (...) The only reaction from the Tigers was to renew their call for an unconditional ceasefire. The government has already rejected any possibility of a truce. In Britain, thousands of Tamils blocked some of London's busiest roads Monday, demonstrating outside the Houses of Parliament for an immediate ceasefire. They want Britain, the former colonial power, to intervene to stop the conflict. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's spokesman said the premier was \"deeply concerned\" at the conflict, a sentiment expressed from several capitals around the world. The mass civilian escape shown in the aerial footage appeared to have been triggered by the Sri Lankan military overrunning a Tiger defensive embankment in the early hours of Monday morning. (...) The government has accused the LTTE of using trapped civilians as a human shield, and the president implied that their escape removed a final obstacle to a military assault. \"The process of the complete defeat of the LTTE has just begun,\" he said. \"It is now all over for the Tigers.\" The Sri Lankan defence ministry said the Tigers killed 17 civilians Monday in at least one suicide bombing that targeted the escaping civilians. (...) According to the United Nations, as many as 100,000 civilians were trapped in LTTE territory and living in \"dire humanitarian conditions\" before Monday's exodus. (...) The LTTE were once seen as one of the world's most efficient guerrilla outfits, controlling a third of Sri Lanka's territory, an overseas fund-raising network and a lucrative shipping business. But now the rebels are outnumbered and surrounded in the jungles outside Mullaittivu, their former military headquarters in the northeast. Defeat would end the Tigers' 37-year campaign for a Tamil homeland within the Sinhalese-majority island.",
