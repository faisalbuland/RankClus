I just thought I could share a little good news that might hopfuly overshadow the world news for a few hours. D.J. Accept my apologizes for being late in congratulations. D.J. May you enjoy all of your grandchildren as I enjoyed my grandparents until they left this world. I only had a short time with my parents and so my grandparents and all of my aunts and uncles have always been special to me. Love 'em all I say and enjoy family best. LJ",
