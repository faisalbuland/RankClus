Those two pics look genuine. GW Bush was doing the little pecks to each cheek thing that is a well established greeting gesture. The first pic you posted was clearly altered by some reprobate to make it look as though GW Bush was playing tonsil-hockey with the King, which never happened. You'll notice that GW Bush never bowed to the king. As I said, that is reserved for the king's subordinates. So does B.O. consider himself subordinate to the King of Saudi Arabia or is he just grossly ignorant of proper protocol? It's one or the other.. either way he truly embarrassed the US with this inappropriate gesture.",

Are you so foolish that you can't see that it's been edited? And btw, bowing to the Saudi king is not customary for anyone but his subjects, genius. At some point you are going to have to stop blaming all B.O.'s fack-ups on GW Bush. You may as well try some honesty and stop now. This is also photoshopped Mr. Obvious? and this?", 
        "reply": " Probably not. Those two pics look genuine. GW Bush was doing the little pecks to each cheek thing that is a well established greeting gesture. The first pic you posted was clearly altered by some reprobate to make it look as though GW Bush was playing tonsil-hockey with the King, which never happened. You'll notice that GW Bush never bowed to the king. As I said, that is reserved for the king's subordinates. So does B.O. consider himself subordinate to the King of Saudi Arabia or is he just grossly ignorant of proper protocol? It's one or the other.. either way he truly embarrassed the US with this inappropriate gesture.",

The First Lady of France was waiting for the traditional \"kiss on the cheek\", and our POTUS instead shakes her hand! She was dumbfounded! Then the POTUS not only shook the Queen of England's hand, but \"cupped\" the Queens hand. This is NOT the proper protocal, and considered \"manhandling\" the Queen! He also gave the Queen an IPod....what was THAT? I wonder if he gave her a \"bump\" before he \"gifted\" her! So what's next? Dap the German Chancellor? High five the Chinese President? Bootie bump the Dali Lama?",

At some point you are going to have to stop blaming all B.O.'s fack-ups on GW Bush. You may as well try some honesty and stop now. This is also photoshopped Mr. Obvious? and this? Probably not. Those two pics look genuine. GW Bush was doing the little pecks to each cheek thing that is a well established greeting gesture. The first pic you posted was clearly altered by some reprobate to make it look as though GW Bush was playing tonsil-hockey with the King, which never happened. You'll notice that GW Bush never bowed to the king. As I said, that is reserved for the king's subordinates. So does B.O. consider himself subordinate to the King of Saudi Arabia or is he just grossly ignorant of proper protocol? It's one or the other.. either way he truly embarrassed the US with this inappropriate gesture.",
