About 30min after i drop it off the mech calls me to tell me i need new valve cover gasket(well he didn't call it that, he called it a belt covered gasket)I say fine,do what needs to be done. The car had been loosing oil anyway, so I knew he wasn't making it up. He calls back again to tell me the car wont be ready till the next day b/c the part won't be there till the next day. He called today about two hrs before they closed, and I told him that I may not be able to pick it up until Monday b/c my ride hadn't contacted me all day. He goes on to say, well just give me your card info over the phone and, you can pick it up tommorow(they are closed the weekends). I'll leave the key in the car for you along with a receipt, and I'll lock it up for you. Ok, keep in mind I only got a tune up, and a valve cover gasket replacement, and it came to $384.00. So I get my car, ride to the store then back. The gate guy says my car is burning something. I smell it the rest of the way home. I ask my neighbor(again) to take a look at it and see what's wrong, and he see's that it's leaking oil. RED FLAG #1) He was in such a rush to get my money, even after I told him i could just pick it up monday(he also made mention he didn't have room for it) RED FLAG#2) $384.00 Seems way overpriced for the work he did RED FLAG #3) He never left my key in the car, or the receipt in the car like he said he would! I'm pi$$ed, and I'm going to dispute these charges! I swear, why do folk have to take advantage of people???????? \"It is the weak who are cruel.

About 30min after i drop it off the mech calls me to tell me i need new valve cover gasket(well he didn't call it that, he called it a belt covered gasket)I say fine,do what needs to be done. The car had been loosing oil anyway, so I knew he wasn't making it up. He calls back again to tell me the car wont be ready till the next day b/c the part won't be there till the next day. He called today about two hrs before they closed, and I told him that I may not be able to pick it up until Monday b/c my ride hadn't contacted me all day. He goes on to say, well just give me your card info over the phone and, you can pick it up tommorow(they are closed the weekends). I'll leave the key in the car for you along with a receipt, and I'll lock it up for you. Ok, keep in mind I only got a tune up, and a valve cover gasket replacement, and it came to $384.00. So I get my car, ride to the store then back. The gate guy says my car is burning something. I smell it the rest of the way home. I ask my neighbor(again) to take a look at it and see what's wrong, and he see's that it's leaking oil. RED FLAG #1) He was in such a rush to get my money, even after I told him i could just pick it up monday(he also made mention he didn't have room for it) RED FLAG#2) $384.00 Seems way overpriced for the work he did RED FLAG #3) He never left my key in the car, or the receipt in the car like he said he would!

The car had been loosing oil anyway, so I knew he wasn't making it up. He calls back again to tell me the car wont be ready till the next day b/c the part won't be there till the next day. He called today about two hrs before they closed, and I told him that I may not be able to pick it up until Monday b/c my ride hadn't contacted me all day. He goes on to say, well just give me your card info over the phone and, you can pick it up tommorow(they are closed the weekends). I'll leave the key in the car for you along with a receipt, and I'll lock it up for you. Ok, keep in mind I only got a tune up, and a valve cover gasket replacement, and it came to $384.00.

I ask my neighbor(again) to take a look at it and see what's wrong, and he see's that it's leaking oil.
