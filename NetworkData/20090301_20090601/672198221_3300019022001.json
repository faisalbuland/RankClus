Although the BYD E6 is still at a concept stage, the E6 could be rolling the streets as soon as 2010. The specifications of the electric car arent that shabby either, a top speed of over 160kph, and the ability to recharge from a 220v electricity outlet within 15 minutes and on a full charge will be able to travel 300km. BYD have been carrying out intensive research work on their batteries, putting them through hot and cold testing to avoid explosions or other quality issues.

I could live with reduced performance/range with a 15 min. 80% recharge, but the maint./replacement cost is still too high.",
