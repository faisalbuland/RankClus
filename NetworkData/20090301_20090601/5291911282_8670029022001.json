My wife and I have been married for five years and have owed taxes each and every year. We have a very basic return. Married, no kids, wife works a 9 to 5, no mortgage, and we always claim 0. Yet every year we end up owing money. This year was the most we've ever owed ($1000). We had our taxes done by a professional once and asked for advice the next year and we've been doing it ourselves since then. Every time we always have the same result of us owing. I really don't understand as to why this is and it's frustrating!",

Maybe a few other posters will help you out. Remember that we are not giving you advice here just talking. MD",

One thing that helps me a lot is that I am a Christian and I Tithe, therefore, with the other charities that I contribute to...my bracket is cut back. Now believe it or don't, but if you tithe WILLINGLY and with a HAPPY HEART, God does provide well for you. There will be some people who are in a financial bind so that they cannot tithe money. God understands these situations, HOWEVER, if the financially strapped situation is due to too many DESIRES and WANTS, but NOT due to actual NEEDS being met...God sees that as well, and He will NOT be mocked. TRUST ME. This is the only place in the Bible where He says, \"Try me on this one and I'll prove it to you.\" For everything else He says, \"Do not tempt the Lord, your God.\" If you do titheing correctly, you WILL not be in want of anything that you NEED. Just my 2 cents here. . P.S. - I got back over 5K this year...not my best year though. These are my opinions. Yours may differ.",
