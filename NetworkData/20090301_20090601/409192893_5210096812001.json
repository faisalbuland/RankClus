Now who could be stopping that when its so obvious thats whats needed? More Nukes, fewer Kooks! I've been saying that for years. To answer your question as to who is stopping them let's go back to who stopped them to begin with. It was President Carter that put the kibosh on the atom. I find that strange considering he was a nuclear engineer and served on atomic submarines. Obviously he knew the benefit of nuclear power and he also knew, properly built and run they're safe. That being the case the only reasonable explanation is that he was swayed by some unknown force. What makes it so sad is that with American know how, had we been allowed to go forward with nuclear power generation, by now the nuclear situation would be very different. Two main factors are most important in considering whether or not to build a grid of nuclear generating stations. The first is safety. Horror stories like The Chernobyl disaster rightfully frighten people. Chernobyl was a poorly built incompletely run accident waiting to happen. There is no comparison between the crude reactors Russia produced and the well designed, carefully built reactors produced here. The very worst incident to take place at any American reactor occurred at the Three Mile Island generating station. There was a small amount of radioactive steam released. The maximum amount of radiation anyone was exposed to was about the amount received during a full set of dental x-rays. Sadly the incident was blown out of proportion by the news hungry media. The second factor is that of \u201chot ash\u201d disposal. It\u2019s true that our current reactors do produce significant amounts of radioactive waste. Had we been allowed to go forth, by now at the very least we\u2019d be building Breeder reactors that produce no hot ash. It\u2019s even possible that, by now we would have such things as Fusan reactors that would be far more efficient and cheaper to build. All of this was short circuited by President Carter for reasons, unknown. Sorry to be so long winded but y'all hit on one of my pet subjects. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",

Now who could be stopping that when its so obvious thats whats needed? More Nukes, fewer Kooks! I've been saying that for years. To answer your question as to who is stopping them let's go back to who stopped them to begin with. It was President Carter that put the kibosh on the atom. I find that strange considering he was a nuclear engineer and served on atomic submarines. Obviously he knew the benefit of nuclear power and he also knew, properly built and run they're safe. That being the case the only reasonable explanation is that he was swayed by some unknown force. What makes it so sad is that with American know how, had we been allowed to go forward with nuclear power generation, by now the nuclear situation would be very different. Two main factors are most important in considering whether or not to build a grid of nuclear generating stations. The first is safety. Horror stories like The Chernobyl disaster rightfully frighten people. Chernobyl was a poorly built incompletely run accident waiting to happen. There is no comparison between the crude reactors Russia produced and the well designed, carefully built reactors produced here. The very worst incident to take place at any American reactor occurred at the Three Mile Island generating station. There was a small amount of radioactive steam released. The maximum amount of radiation anyone was exposed to was about the amount received during a full set of dental x-rays. Sadly the incident was blown out of proportion by the news hungry media. The second factor is that of \u201chot ash\u201d disposal. It\u2019s true that our current reactors do produce significant amounts of radioactive waste. Had we been allowed to go forth, by now at the very least we\u2019d be building Breeder reactors that produce no hot ash. It\u2019s even possible that, by now we would have such things as Fusan reactors that would be far more efficient and cheaper to build. All of this was short circuited by President Carter for reasons, unknown. Sorry to be so long winded but y'all hit on one of my pet subjects. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",

As a matter of fact he's often able to sell excess electricity to his electric supplier. By law they must buy his surplus electricity.

It is a more stable supply and does not ruin the land use or view. I bet you want one in your backyard too. I got one, it is named Grand Gulf. So it looks like two of us do indeed have them.
