Now, the authority responsible for Canadian domains \u2014 website names ending with the suffix .ca \u2014 is for the first time blocking access to certain unregistered names in the hope of beating the computer worm before it has a chance wreak havoc on April 1. \"This is the first [worm] that has targeted the domain-name system,\" said Byron Holland, president and CEO of the Canadian Internet Registration Authority. \"This one is right in our space.\" A nasty piece of software most commonly known by the name Conficker began infecting computers around the world late last year. Once infected, the computers can be incorporated into a sort of mesh that results in a very powerful single entity called a botnet. Botnets can be used to do everything from transmitting viruses to sending out massive amounts of spam. On April 1, the infected computers are expected to try to contact an as-yet-undiscovered control centre by logging on to thousands of Internet domain names, one of which will be the control hub. Internet Links Microsoft: Conficker virus alert Canadian Internet Registration Authority: Conficker FAQs Symantec.com: Understanding Cornficker Wikipedia on the virus SRI technical report Previous versions of the worm contained instructions to scour a list of about 250 Internet domain names which could potentially be used to send instructions to infected computers. The latest update expands that list to some 50,000 randomly generated domain names, making it very difficult to pre-emptively cut off communication between the infected computers and the control centre. The CIRA has already begun to block access to some of the unregistered domain names being generated by Conficker, and is monitoring the registered ones to see if any could belong to the culprit, Mr. Holland said. Because the worm appears to sidestep computers based in Ukraine, there is some speculation that it originated in that country. So-called \"zombie computers\" infected with Conficker \u2014 estimates put the number of infected computers at more than 10 million \u2014 are expected to simultaneously contact a central control hub on April 1 to ask for instructions. Symptoms of infection can include network congestion and the disabling of certain Windows security services. What happens next appears to be anyone's guess. A resulting supercomputer, the sum of the millions of infected computers, could be used as a computer-for-hire to send spam, or to search the infected computers for private data which could then be exploited or sold, or to attack critical computer infrastructure. Or the whole thing could be one big April Fool's Day joke. Nobody seems to know for sure. \"Based on our collective technical analysis, we've determined that systems infected with the latest version of Conficker will begin to use a new algorithm to determine what domains to contact,\" said Bruce Cowper, chief security adviser at Microsoft Canada. \"We have not identified any other actions scheduled to take place on April 1, 2009.\" Microsoft, one of a number of software and computer security firms \u2014 called the \"Conficker Cabal\" \u2014 that are waging a virtual war against Conficker's anonymous authors, has put up a $250,000 reward for information leading to the authors' capture. (Conficker only targets Windows-based computers). Even if it does turn out to be a hoax, the Conficker worm has already caused numerous headaches. British and French military operations were reportedly slowed because of concerns over infected machines. A recent report by SRI International, an independent, California-based research organization, described the wide spectrum of possible outcomes should Conficker achieve its authors' goals: \"Perhaps in the best case, Conficker may be used as a sustained and profitable platform for massive Internet fraud and theft. \"In the worst case, Conficker could be turned into a powerful offensive weapon for performing concerted information warfare attacks that could disrupt not just countries, but the Internet itself.\" WHAT HAPPENS APRIL 1? April 1, a malicious piece of code that has infected millions of computers is expected to try to contact its control centre. What happens next is a mystery. OK .... why were their fighters on Internet in the first place?",
