Is THIS what the Muslim Nations want for their brothers in religion? If so, how DESPICABLE! Complete evidence that the U N is not only worthless but dangerous. Was colonialism worse? Oh, the stupid, ignorant kid pirate is behaving as he thinks WE, his captors, think we want him to. He is unembarrassed because he thinks the only error he made was in getting caught, and that's just part of the game. sO SMILE, MAKE YOURSELF AGREEABLE AND HARMLESS, AND MAYBE THEY'SS LET HIM GO. NOT! The whole thing just makes my stomach churn. Our new President needs to STOP with the ROAD TRIPS and STOP whizzing TRILLIONS down the rat hole, and get to work! REMEMBER, FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY? Remember TRANSPARENCY? NO EARMARKS, NO PORK, LINE BY LINE EDITING, and for GOD's Sake STOP aggravating our ALLIES and sucking up to our ENEMIES!!! So far, Mr. Obama, you've irritated Canada (latest), G. B. Germany, France and who knows who else. You've SUCKED UP to the Castro brothers (communist dictatorship) , Danny Ortega (communist) and Hugo Chaves (communist dictator). Just STOP IT and get a grip.",

Is THIS what the Muslim Nations want for their brothers in religion? If so, how DESPICABLE! Complete evidence that the U N is not only worthless but dangerous. Was colonialism worse? Oh, the stupid, ignorant kid pirate is behaving as he thinks WE, his captors, think we want him to. He is unembarrassed because he thinks the only error he made was in getting caught, and that's just part of the game. sO SMILE, MAKE YOURSELF AGREEABLE AND HARMLESS, AND MAYBE THEY'SS LET HIM GO. NOT! The whole thing just makes my stomach churn. Our new President needs to STOP with the ROAD TRIPS and STOP whizzing TRILLIONS down the rat hole, and get to work! REMEMBER, FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY? Remember TRANSPARENCY? NO EARMARKS, NO PORK, LINE BY LINE EDITING, and for GOD's Sake STOP aggravating our ALLIES and sucking up to our ENEMIES!!! So far, Mr. Obama, you've irritated Canada (latest), G. B. Germany, France and who knows who else. You've SUCKED UP to the Castro brothers (communist dictatorship) , Danny Ortega (communist) and Hugo Chaves (communist dictator). Just STOP IT and get a grip.",
