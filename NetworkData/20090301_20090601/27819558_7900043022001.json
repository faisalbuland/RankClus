Jonathan Merritt doesn\u2019t want to talk about his own views on gay marriage or civil unions -- perhaps for good reason. Merritt is a young evangelical leader, a prominent writer on modern faith, and the son of a former Southern Baptist Convention president. The religious landscape of this country may be changing, but anyone who espouses equality could derail a future leadership role among evangelicals, who still vote overwhelmingly Republican and have viewed homosexuality as a defining social issue since the early days of the Moral Majority. Merritt prefers to zoom out during an interview and opine as candid observer rather than crusader. My generation will not fight to preserve the platform for traditional marriage that our predecessors have fought for,\u201d the 26-year-old says. \u201cOlder evangelicals are so stubborn and unable to compromise or reach out a hand. And they\u2019re in danger of losing their legacy.\u201d This is a very interesting article. To read in full, go to > >http://www.advocate.com/issue_story_ektid76664.asp",

Isn't this the big day Xians celebrate the \"BIG DOUBT\"...\"Father, why hast thou FORSAKEN me?\" Sounds like worry to me, but then he is being tortured by legitimate government policy for questioning the established religion and political occupiers of his day. You can get the idea from reading the NT that none of them were too sure what was going on... anytime! And, of course, this weekend is the celebration of the ultimate popular mythical horror story of the dead coming back to terrorize the living with the promise \"I'm gonna' git ya, sucker\"... eventually, anyhow. Anyway, it's about time the popular Evangelical crowd get's on the band wagon of Jesus... but it's not something new. Many have been doing so for a long time. It's just the noise ones who capture the attention they are some god's mouth piece for now. btw there are a couple of good books out that might interest those who have trouble buying into any type of obnoxious fundamentalist: Karen Armstrong's \"The Bible\" and \"Jesus Interrupted\" by somebody else (I haven't read the later yet.) Find out for yourselves how all this got cooked up over the Centuries since the first story got told. Have a nice spring weekend no matter what you believe! May the farce be with you! And let's hope the silly DA/DT rule get's banished to the dark places of history!!!",
