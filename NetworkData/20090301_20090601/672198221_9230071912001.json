Heh, heh, if you note, I'm \"agreeing\" with Ms Qwerty, not arguing with her... Capitalism, has turned it's attention to the \"requests\" of the market. You have a problem with that? The electric car IS the future. Advances in battery and electric motor technology are coming so rapidly that it's hard to keep up with them - And I actually TRY to keep up with them. What Detroit has on the drawing board NOW, is dead in the water. It's been rendered obsolete by technology. Even so, the car itself may be viable. But when I buy an electric car, it's not going to be for 57K... Dave PS. Federal law requires that parts will be available for ten years for every model of any car built. Even bankruptcy doesn't save a company from that requirement.",

Even with a $7,500 credit it's a lot more. You could buy a lot of gas for the difference. How much do the batteries cost? How long do they last? And you don't recharge them for free. Tesla makes a sports car. costs over 100K. For thousands less you can get a Vette with comperable performance and a huge dealer network to back it up. What do you do when your Tesla breaks down in Omaha? No thanks!",
