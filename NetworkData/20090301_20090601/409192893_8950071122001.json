VA Benefits are NOT TAXABLE, not reportable and there is no place to put them on a Federal 1040 of any kind. EXCEPT 2007 For the 2007 Tax year, the economic stimulus bill passed and enacted in 2008 by President Bush, allowed for the reporting of normally not reported income to allow those people, ordinarily not required to file, a chance to receive the $300 stimulus payment. The non-taxable VA benefits could be recorded on either a 1040, 1040A, or the informational supershort 1040-ST (it was so confusing we never used it, EVER, and threw the ones our clients brought in away) On your 1040 your non-taxable VA benefits should have shown up on line 20a as a non-taxable Social Security distribution. It went there, because the IRS already had thier system programmed and the forms printed and there was nowhere else to put it. on a 1040A, it should have shown up on line 14a, once again as non-taxable Social Security. IF your 2007 return was filed, and your NON-TAXABLE VA benefits were included as regular income and taxed, you are entitled to file an ammend. You will get your overpayment back, plus interest from the Department of the Treasury in the form of a check. I do request that you have a professional look at the ammend. They're a PITA even for those of us who do them. The paperwork is very specific and detailed and incorrect filing is often the reason ammends are rejected. SO - If your return is wrong, these are the steps you need to follow: 1. If you prepared the return yourself (via online, turboT, greenbox box company etc,) take it to a professional and have it reviewed in person. MANY many professionals review these kinds of things for free, I know I do, ESPECIALLY for Veterans. 2. If you had the return professionally prepared in the first place, take it back and have them fix it. They should fix it for free, and if they don't, report them to the BBB and take it somewhere else. 3. If you're looking for a reputable tax preparer, someone who isn't going to jerk you around, and is in your area, you can find someone (probably someone like myself who has their own office and is IN it year round) by going to the website wwwDOTnaeaDOTorg. Mouseover the button on the title banner that says \"resources\" and click on the option that says \"for taxpayers\". You can then click on the option that says \"FIND AN ENROLLED AGENT\" to find a preparer in your area that can assist you. Remember, you have 3 years from the original filing deadline to file an ammend and get back the funds that are due to you.",

Nonassignability and exempt status of benefits STATUTE: (a) Payments of benefits due or to become due under any law administered by the Secretary shall not be assignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law, and such payments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation, shall be exempt from the claim of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary. The preceding sentence shall not apply to claims of the United States arising under such laws nor shall the exemption therein contained as to taxation extend to any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of insurance otherwise authorized under chapter 19 of this title, or of servicemen's indemnity. For the purposes of this subsection, in any case where a payee of an educational assistance allowance has designated the address of an attorney-in-fact as the payee's address for the purpose of receiving a benefit check and has also executed a power of attorney giving the attorney-in-fact authority to negotiate such benefit check, such action shall be deemed to be an assignment and is prohibited. (b) This section shall prohibit the collection by setoff or otherwise out of any benefits payable pursuant to any law administered by the Secretary and relating to veterans, their estates, or their dependents, of any claim of the United States or any agency thereof against (1) any person other than the indebted beneficiary or the beneficiary's estate; or (2) any beneficiary or the beneficiary's estate except amounts due the United States by such beneficiary or the beneficiary's estate by reason of overpayments or illegal payments made under such laws to such beneficiary or the beneficiary's estate or to the beneficiary's dependents as such. If the benefits referred to in the preceding sentence are insurance payable by reason of yearly renewable term insurance, United States Government life insurance, or National Service Life Insurance issued by the United States, the exemption provided in this section shall not apply to indebtedness existing against the particular insurance contract upon the maturity of which the claim is based, whether such indebtedness is in the form of liens to secure unpaid premiums or loans, or interest on such premiums or loans, or indebtedness arising from overpayments of dividends, refunds, loans, or other insurance benefits. (c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may, after receiving a request under paragraph (2) of this subsection relating to a veteran, collect by offset of any compensation or pension payable to the veteran under laws administered by the Secretary the uncollected portion of the amount of any indebtedness associated with the veteran's participation in a plan prescribed in chapter 73 of title 10. (2) If the Secretary concerned (as defined in section 101(5) of title 37) has tried under section 3711(a) of title 31 to collect an amount described in paragraph (1) of this subsection in the case of any veteran, has been unable to collect such amount, and has determined that the uncollected portion of such amount is not collectible from amounts payable by that Secretary to the veteran or that the veteran is not receiving any payment from that Secretary, that Secretary may request the Secretary to make collections in the case of such veteran as authorized in paragraph (1) of this subsection. (3)(A) A collection authorized by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures prescribed in section 3716 of title 31 for administrative offset collections made after attempts to collect claims under section 3711(a) of such title. (B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, as used in the second sentence of section 3716(a) of title 31 - (i) the term ''records of the agency'' shall be considered to refer to the records of the department of the Secretary concerned; and (ii) the term ''agency'' in clauses (3) and (4) shall be considered to refer to such department. (4) Funds collected under this subsection shall be credited to the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund under chapter 74 of title 10 or to the Retired Pay Account of the Coast Guard, as appropriate. (d) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, payments of benefits under laws administered by the Secretary shall not be exempt from levy under subchapter D of chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6331 et seq.). (e) In the case of a person who - (1) has been determined to be eligible to receive pension or compensation under laws administered by the Secretary but for the receipt by such person of pay pursuant to any provision of law providing retired or retirement pay to members or former members of the Armed Forces or commissioned officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or of the Public Health Service; and (2) files a waiver of such pay in accordance with section 5305 of this title in the amount of such pension or compensation before the end of the one-year period beginning on the date such person is notified by the Secretary of such person's eligibility for such pension or compensation, the retired or retirement pay of such person shall be exempt from taxation, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, in an amount equal to the amount of pension or compensation which would have been paid to such person but for the receipt by such person of such pay.
