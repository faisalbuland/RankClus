The real solution is two fold, lighter materials for everything from pack frames to boots, and command emphasis on reducing unnecessary items in the pack load. A special issue is the number of battery powered items and the weight and life of the batteries. Just replacing the old D cell angle head flashlight with the AA version represents close to a pound saved from the combination of the light and a spare set of batteries.

        "reply": "\"The WW I/WW II stadard load with heavier materials was about 45-50 pounds. We need to set that as the goal and not accept loads greater than 75 pounds.\" I always wondered about that--why were we able to keep a load of canvas, leather, wood, and tin cans lighter than a load of modern materials? I'm not military, just curious--what accounts for the difference? Is the additional load worth it to you guys or would you trade it all for what our grandfathers carried at half the weight?",
