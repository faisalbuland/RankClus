Liberating \"free\" enterprise or private enterprise from any bonds imposed by the government (the state) no matter how much social damage this causes.

To convince us this is good for us, they say \"an unregulated market is the best way to increase economic growth, which will ultimately benefit everyone.\" It's like Reagan's \"supply-side\" and \"trickle-down\" economics. 2. CUTTING PUBLIC EXPENDITURE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES like education and health care. REDUCING THE SAFETY-NET FOR THE POOR, and even maintenance of roads, bridges, water supply -- again in the name of reducing government's role. Of course, they don't oppose government subsidies and tax benefits for business. 3.DEREGULATION. Reduce government regulation of everything that could diminish profits, including protecting the environment and safety on the job. 4.PRIVATIZATION. Sell state-owned enterprises, goods and services to private investors. This includes banks, key industries, railroads, toll highways, electricity, schools, hospitals and even fresh water. Although usually done in the name of greater efficiency, which is often needed, privatization has mainly had the effect of concentrating wealth even more in a few hands and making the public pay even more for its needs. 5. ELIMINATING THE CONCEPT OF \"THE PUBLIC GOOD\" or \"COMMUNITY\" and replacing it with \"individual responsibility.\" Pressuring the poorest people in a society to find solutions to their lack of health care, education and social security all by themselves -- then blaming them, if they fail, as \"lazy.\"",

Classical liberalism can also be called traditional liberalism. It is neither left nor right. But, it is at the far end of the spectrum furthest away from authoritarian (fascism). And, it is not to be confused with social liberalism, neoliberalism or paleoliberalism. The Democratic and Republican Parties used to be more classical liberal in their early lives, but have leaned more toward social liberal and neoliberal ideas respectively. While they do have differences in the left right paradigm, they both most definitely lean toward an authoritarian ideology. I personally do not like this particular test because many of the questions asked will have two opposing things of which I agree with neither. Also, they equate neo-liberalism with libertarianism, which is not accurate. Because, libertarianism is actually classical liberalism, or traditional liberalism. And, you can tell by reading much of the definitions that there is a bias that is conveyed by the inflection of the words. I think that this quiz is not solely for the American political scale because of the scale and definitions used. This is most definitely a European model. I very much prefer the Nolan chart. It is a far better representation of where a person stands politically. And, it is based on an American model rather than a European model. Plus, it only has 10 questions with defined answers rather than a ton of questions with agree/disagree answers. This message has been edited. Last edited by: 10Tenths, Sun 10 May 2009 02:13 PM",
