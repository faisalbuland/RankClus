Although this will require changes to the law, the secretary and chairman are working to address the challenges associated with implementation of the president's commitment.\" The comments were a 180-degree reversal of what Morrell had told reporters during a Tuesday briefing. \"I do not believe there are any plans under way in this building for some expected, but not articulated, anticipation that \u2018don't ask, don't tell\u2019 will be repealed,\" Morrell said. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who has been saying for weeks that President Obama is working with military leaders and Congress to change the policy, enthusiastically reported news of Morrell\u2019s change of heart during the press briefing Thursday.
