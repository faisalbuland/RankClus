Bruce, most of the threads in this forum have nothing to do specifically with religion in the military. I've seen plenty of discussions from people of several different religions, none of which specifically address the practice of religion in the military. Really, this is (or has become) pretty much a forum for military personnel, veterans, and military family members to discuss religion in general. If we had to remove any thread that didn't specifically have to do with religion in the military, we'd have to delete easily over 90% of this forum. Here's a twist for this discussion to bring it back to the military... I've seen lots of Christian bookstores and resource centers near military bases. That's all fine and good, of course. However, I've never seen a pagan supply center within easy access of a military base. I'm curious... if someone were to open such a store not far outside the gates of a military base, how much would they have to endure harassment and protests from the ignorant masses who think they're practicing Satanism and want to run them out of town? I've noticed a lot of open hostility towards earth-based religions on military bases.",

WHAS11\u2019s Adrianna Hopkins talked to a local witch to dispel the myth. We take you behind the magic and show you why this religion has cast its spell on Louisville. \u201cThings are not quite what they seem.\u201d Forget what you\u2019ve seen on TV. \u201cCan we ride brooms? No. We can\u2019t ride brooms.\u201d Walk into Linda Tipton\u2019s store \u201cMoonstruck\u201d and amid the altars, the candles, the herbs and the statues. Linda Tipton said, \u201cWe can\u2019t fly; we can\u2019t jump from place to place; I can\u2019t twitch my nose and clean my house - I wish I could! It\u2019d be great!\u201d Linda\u2019s store has all things pagan. Linda Tipton said, \u201cPaganism is real hard to explain. It doesn\u2019t mean ungodly. It doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t believe in any god. Most pagans believe in more than one god.\u201d Linda Tipton said, \u201cI was always interested in what you might call the cult things. I was always fascinated with witches and that kind of thing.\u201d The worship tools you\u2019ll find for sale are quite different from what she used to use. Linda Tipton said, \u201cI grew up Christian. Disciples of Christ. I was at one time a Sunday School teacher, Choir Director, Children\u2019s Choir Director. Sang in the choir myself. Was very active in church.\u201d But at 17 years old, she scratched the itch and explored. She found a book about witches and witchcraft and before she knew it, she was spellbound. Linda Tipton said, \u201cIn Wicca, there is not a Jesus Christ or a Christ figure; there is no actual set book that we call our Bible; most Wiccans don\u2019t believe in the devil; there is no version of sin. We don\u2019t speak of sin,\u201d Tipton explains. \u201cThere are spells and the best way to think about spells is they\u2019re like prayers. They\u2019re like petitions to the god and goddess. We do believe there is a place we go when we pass on. Our Wiccans call it \u2018Summerland.\u2019\u201d Tipton says, Wicca is a \u201cnature religion\u201d and witches are \u201cstewards of the Earth.\u201d They see it as a living being. Linda also says the \u201ccraft\u201d is centuries old\u2014and the salvation for her agricultural Celtic ancestors. Linda Tipton said, \u201cThey had a great understanding of the season and of the animals and the plants and how it all interconnected.\u201d The magic is still there. Hundreds of pagans gather for seasonal festivals throughout Kentucky. But like other religions, not everyone tolerates their beliefs. \u201cThere are many people who still think that wiccans are devil worshippers,\u201d says Linda. \u201cBe very careful not to judge other people until you really understand where they\u2019re coming from because Christ said \u2018judge not lest you be judged.\u201d One of the pagan seasonal festivals, \u201cBeltane,\u201d is coming up May 1st, 2nd and 3rd. The festival is a celebration of the god and goddess and their union.",

Linda Tipton said, \u201cWe can\u2019t fly; we can\u2019t jump from place to place; I can\u2019t twitch my nose and clean my house - I wish I could! It\u2019d be great!\u201d Linda\u2019s store has all things pagan. Linda Tipton said, \u201cPaganism is real hard to explain. It doesn\u2019t mean ungodly. It doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t believe in any god. Most pagans believe in more than one god.\u201d Linda Tipton said, \u201cI was always interested in what you might call the cult things. I was always fascinated with witches and that kind of thing.\u201d The worship tools you\u2019ll find for sale are quite different from what she used to use. Linda Tipton said, \u201cI grew up Christian. Disciples of Christ. I was at one time a Sunday School teacher, Choir Director, Children\u2019s Choir Director. Sang in the choir myself. Was very active in church.\u201d But at 17 years old, she scratched the itch and explored. She found a book about witches and witchcraft and before she knew it, she was spellbound. Linda Tipton said, \u201cIn Wicca, there is not a Jesus Christ or a Christ figure; there is no actual set book that we call our Bible; most Wiccans don\u2019t believe in the devil; there is no version of sin. We don\u2019t speak of sin,\u201d Tipton explains. \u201cThere are spells and the best way to think about spells is they\u2019re like prayers. They\u2019re like petitions to the god and goddess. We do believe there is a place we go when we pass on. Our Wiccans call it \u2018Summerland.\u2019\u201d Tipton says, Wicca is a \u201cnature religion\u201d and witches are \u201cstewards of the Earth.\u201d They see it as a living being. Linda also says the \u201ccraft\u201d is centuries old\u2014and the salvation for her agricultural Celtic ancestors. Linda Tipton said, \u201cThey had a great understanding of the season and of the animals and the plants and how it all interconnected.\u201d The magic is still there. Hundreds of pagans gather for seasonal festivals throughout Kentucky. But like other religions, not everyone tolerates their beliefs. \u201cThere are many people who still think that wiccans are devil worshippers,\u201d says Linda. \u201cBe very careful not to judge other people until you really understand where they\u2019re coming from because Christ said \u2018judge not lest you be judged.\u201d One of the pagan seasonal festivals, \u201cBeltane,\u201d is coming up May 1st, 2nd and 3rd. The festival is a celebration of the god and goddess and their union.",
