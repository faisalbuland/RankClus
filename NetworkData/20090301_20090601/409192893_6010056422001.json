I've had my Chevy for 4 years/45K miles and the ONLY problem I've had with it is recently - and that's only because the \"Roadside Assistance\" guy accidentally shorted my battery to my engine block while installing a new battery.

I can't speak for the rest of Ford, but I know that in terms of the electronics that we supply them, Ford's quality standards are quite lacking when compared even to Chrysler and GM - let alone Honda or Toyota. We've had instances where we've had suspect bad parts on the engine controller and when we set them aside for additional testing that Ford's response has been \"Send them anyway - if they're bad we'll replace them at factory or dealer level!\"",

As part of the Blue Oval's future, the Fiesta small car will finally be making its way back to the U.S. as a 2011 model in early 2010, as confirmed by Ford today. A few weeks ago Ford revealed the key features of the U.S.-spec car via the Fiesta's minisite. A 1.6L four-cylinder with twin independent variable valve timing will offer enough pep for the American palate, while likely planting the Fiesta firmly among the most efficient non-hybrids on offer. The Ford/Microsoft Sync system will be an available option, offering a high degree of technological connectivity - an option which has proven popular on the Focus sedan so far. Other basics include keyless entry, available 16-inch aluminum wheels, a choice of three different cloth or leather upholstery options, plus a 4\" multifunction display, seven airbags and a standard electronic stability control system. Though the car will be among the smallest four-doors on the market when it comes to America, Ford appears to be positioning the car for a rather premium space in the segment. That will give Ford a chance to clear a better profit margin in the notoriously tough small-car arena, but it could also limit volume somewhat. On the other hand, Honda's Fit, which is positioned similarly within the market, is selling strongly even now. Once the current Ford truck line at the Cautitlan, Mexico plant is done retooling for the new minicar, production will start for an expected early 2010 North American debut.

As part of the Blue Oval's future, the Fiesta small car will finally be making its way back to the U.S. as a 2011 model in early 2010, as confirmed by Ford today. A few weeks ago Ford revealed the key features of the U.S.-spec car via the Fiesta's minisite. A 1.6L four-cylinder with twin independent variable valve timing will offer enough pep for the American palate, while likely planting the Fiesta firmly among the most efficient non-hybrids on offer. The Ford/Microsoft Sync system will be an available option, offering a high degree of technological connectivity - an option which has proven popular on the Focus sedan so far. Other basics include keyless entry, available 16-inch aluminum wheels, a choice of three different cloth or leather upholstery options, plus a 4\" multifunction display, seven airbags and a standard electronic stability control system. Though the car will be among the smallest four-doors on the market when it comes to America, Ford appears to be positioning the car for a rather premium space in the segment. That will give Ford a chance to clear a better profit margin in the notoriously tough small-car arena, but it could also limit volume somewhat. On the other hand, Honda's Fit, which is positioned similarly within the market, is selling strongly even now. Once the current Ford truck line at the Cautitlan, Mexico plant is done retooling for the new minicar, production will start for an expected early 2010 North American debut.
