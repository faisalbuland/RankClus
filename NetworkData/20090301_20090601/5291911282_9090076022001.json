I just got my orders today, and already I have questions regarding my current status. Since I am and alternate and not a permanent selectee, I know I still have to complete the training as required. But what are the chances of me going even as alternate?. Should I be worried? I really wanted to pick a GWOT billet off of jass instead of taking TAD orders. In order for me to PCS to Cali for training in San Diego, I\u2019m aware if the permanent selectee doesn\u2019t go I have to step in. But If anyone can shed some light on the situation that would be awesome thanks a lot AD2",
