The story of the Samaritan is a vile example of Jesus' hatred for his people or his ignorance of the law. Remember, the story never happened it was a TALE. The actual teachings of the Law is that saving a life is above Shabbath. In other words, it is commanded TO BRAKE SHABBATH in orther to save other's life. Someone asked if Jesus lied, well... A sin of omission by Jesus? The TALE of the Samaritan had a purpose, to perpetuate the idea that Jews cannot possible be close to G-d with their human-made rituals! To which would you ascribe the the greater charity? Since this did not happened... who cares! And since the story had the purpose to teach that EVERYONE is capable of compassion exept the Jews, you cannot possible in good faith decide that a person that hates his own people is worth much. To which would you ascribe the character of following the \"laws\" in spirit, rather than to the letter!! Not to Jesus for sure, since he and his teachings are based on open hatred for his own, which BTW is against the Law. What does it mean the spirit of the law and the letter of the law? That is Paul's teachings. Furthermore, how do you know what you are following (the letter or the spirit) if you ignore the basic contents of the law. Such as the fact that Shabbath has to be broken to save a life? That WAS, and IS, the message of Christ, then and now.

        "quote": "Originally posted by tawodi: Jesus went to the gentiles. He healed the servant of a Roman Centurian. He spoke to the woman at the well, one of the reviled by the Pharisies, Samaritans. His tale of the Good Samaritan concerned the ritual observing Pharasy and the priestly Levite leaving the man to die on the side of the road for fear of ritual uncleanness on the spproaching Sabbath, rather than attend the human needs of the wounded man. The story of the Samaritan is a vile example of Jesus' hatred for his people or his ignorance of the law. Remember, the story never happened it was a TALE. The actual teachings of the Law is that saving a life is above Shabbath. In other words, it is commanded TO BRAKE SHABBATH in orther to save other's life. Someone asked if Jesus lied, well... A sin of omission by Jesus? The TALE of the Samaritan had a purpose, to perpetuate the idea that Jews cannot possible be close to G-d with their human-made rituals! To which would you ascribe the the greater charity? Since this did not happened... who cares! And since the story had the purpose to teach that EVERYONE is capable of compassion exept the Jews, you cannot possible in good faith decide that a person that hates his own people is worth much. To which would you ascribe the character of following the \"laws\" in spirit, rather than to the letter!! Not to Jesus for sure, since he and his teachings are based on open hatred for his own, which BTW is against the Law. What does it mean the spirit of the law and the letter of the law? That is Paul's teachings. Furthermore, how do you know what you are following (the letter or the spirit) if you ignore the basic contents of the law. Such as the fact that Shabbath has to be broken to save a life? That WAS, and IS, the message of Christ, then and now. That is why Jesus was so far from G-d, for he did not understand the Law of the L-rd: \" 1 HAPPY IS the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful. 2 But his delight is in the law of HaShem; and in His law doth he meditate day and night...\" ..........

Again the Jews picked up stones to stone Him, but Jesus said to them, \u2018I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?\u2019 \u201cWe are not stoning you for any of these,\u201d replied the Jews, \u201cbut for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.\u201d Revelation 1:8: Alpha/Omega = Almighty = The One who is to come = Lord God Revelation 21:6-7: Alpha/Omega = Beginning/End = God Revelation 22:12-13: Alpha/Omega = The One who is coming soon = Beginning/End = First/Last Revelation 1:17-18; First/Last = Living One = \u201cI was dead, and behold I am alive forever and ever!\u201d \u2022 Isaiah 44:6: \u201cThis is what the LORD says\u2014 Israel\u2019s King and Redeemer, the LORD Almighty. I am the first and I am the Last; apart from me there is no God.\u201d \u2013 also check out Isaiah 48:12-16. \u2022 John 1:49: Then Nathanael declared, \u201cRabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\u201d John 1:1: \u201cIn the beginning was The Word, and The Word was with God, and The Word was God.\u201d John 1:18: \u201cNo one has ever seen God (the Father), but God the One and Only, who is at the Father\u2019s side, has made him known.\u201d 2Peter 1:1 \u201cSimon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:\u201d and check out Isaiah 43:11\u2026 Faith is not won by debate. GlassOnion, Your last statement is true. Faith is never won by debate. I understand your faith in Jeus and its importance to you. I only addressed the questions based on the assumption that we were talking about the G-d of Israel, whom Jesus claimed to be. My approach is not to debate faith. I don't want you to change what you believe, nor I am suggesting that you should believe in a different way, your faith is yours and I respect that. Rather I am expressing my viewpoint based on Jewish idea of Whom is HaShem and then compare Him with Jesus to reach a conclusion. Isaiah 43:10-11 \"10 Ye are My witnesses [Israel], saith HaShem, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me [surely Jesus does not need to believe G-d if he is G-d], and understand that I am He; before Me there was no G-d formed, neither shall any be after Me. I, even I, am HaShem; and beside Me there is no saviour.\" Why did not HaShem use this opportunity to say:\"I am HaShem and beside Me and Jesus there is no savior\"?

However, just as Christians have to be vigilant and deal with arrogant, \"my way or the highway\" Christians, the atheist community needs to be vigilant and deal with arrogant, \"my way or the highway\" atheists. (I ran into one just last week - a young college student spouting the line that anyone who believes in any religion of any kind is mentally ill and needs to be institutionalized and put under a doctor's care and that anyone who claims to be an agnostic is really an atheist who's a wimp.) Yep I've known some of them also ( not many but a few) Most of the atheist just dont want to be preached at while they are enjoying a good cup-o-coffiee. JMHO D.J.",

The story of the Samaritan is a vile example of Jesus' hatred for his people or his ignorance of the law. Remember, the story never happened it was a TALE. The actual teachings of the Law is that saving a life is above Shabbath. In other words, it is commanded TO BRAKE SHABBATH in orther to save other's life. Someone asked if Jesus lied, well... A sin of omission by Jesus? The TALE of the Samaritan had a purpose, to perpetuate the idea that Jews cannot possible be close to G-d with their human-made rituals! To which would you ascribe the the greater charity? Since this did not happened... who cares!

        "quote": "Originally posted by soscorpio: IX, Your answers are not in bold. They clearly contradict the NT. Let us review: [QUOTE]Is God different than Jesus? Yes. G-d is not a man. Jesus is a man. Is G-d different from Jesus? Yes, one is G-d the other not. How did Jesus expect us to disciple NATIONS - teaching them His ways? What are His ways? I was under the impresion that Jesus said not to go to the gentiles, for he had come to the lost of Israel. But again... who knows! This is Mat 10:5-6: \"These twelve Jesus sent out, charging them, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" Are Jesus' ways different than God's? Yes, big time! Jesus is offered as a human sacrifice/G-d hates human sacrifice G-d knows and loves His Torah/Jesus does not know Torah (otherwise he would have never let anyone assume that the Levite in the Samaritan tale could not save the life of another because it was Shabbath). G-d is Ehad/Jesus is the second person of the Trinity I mean the list is long. I can continue if you wish me to. Was Jesus a liar? Not sure, because there is not written documents left by him. All we know about him was written several years after his death. Nobody will ever know if Jesus consider himself to be G-d or if that was an invention of his followers. If not a liar maybe he just did not know Torah and sometimes got a bit confused?",

Matthew 28:16-20 16 But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated. 17 When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful. 18 And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, \u201cAll authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 \u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\u201d quote: Originally posted by ixcatzin: [QUOTE]Originally posted by GlassOnion: Are Jesus' ways different than God's? Yes, big time! John 20:24-29 24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples were saying to him, \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201d But he said to them, \u201cUnless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.\u201d 26 After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d 27 Then He said to Thomas, [color:RED]\u201cReach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.\u201d 28 Thomas answered and said to Him, \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d 29 Jesus said to him, \u201cBecause you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.\u201d quote: Originally posted by ixcatzin: [QUOTE]Originally posted by GlassOnion: Was Jesus a liar? Not sure, because there is not written documents left by him. All we know about him was written several years after his death. Nobody will ever know if Jesus consider himself to be G-d or if that was an invention of his followers. Matthew 27:11 11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d And Jesus said to him, \u201cIt is as you say.\u201d \u2026but that\u2019s just what He says\u2026",

GlassOnion, Your last statement is true. Faith is never won by debate. I understand your faith in Jeus and its importance to you. I only addressed the questions based on the assumption that we were talking about the G-d of Israel, whom Jesus claimed to be. My approach is not to debate faith. I don't want you to change what you believe, nor I am suggesting that you should believe in a different way, your faith is yours and I respect that. Rather I am expressing my viewpoint based on Jewish idea of Whom is HaShem and then compare Him with Jesus to reach a conclusion. Isaiah 43:10-11 \"10 Ye are My witnesses [Israel], saith HaShem, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me [surely Jesus does not need to believe G-d if he is G-d], and understand that I am He; before Me there was no G-d formed, neither shall any be after Me. I, even I, am HaShem; and beside Me there is no saviour.\" Why did not HaShem use this opportunity to say:\"I am HaShem and beside Me and Jesus there is no savior\"?

The story of the Samaritan is a vile example of Jesus' hatred for his people or his ignorance of the law. Remember, the story never happened it was a TALE. The actual teachings of the Law is that saving a life is above Shabbath. In other words, it is commanded TO BRAKE SHABBATH in orther to save other's life. Someone asked if Jesus lied, well... A sin of omission by Jesus? The TALE of the Samaritan had a purpose, to perpetuate the idea that Jews cannot possible be close to G-d with their human-made rituals!

        "quote": "Originally posted by tawodi: Jesus went to the gentiles. He healed the servant of a Roman Centurian. He spoke to the woman at the well, one of the reviled by the Pharisies, Samaritans. His tale of the Good Samaritan concerned the ritual observing Pharasy and the priestly Levite leaving the man to die on the side of the road for fear of ritual uncleanness on the spproaching Sabbath, rather than attend the human needs of the wounded man. The story of the Samaritan is a vile example of Jesus' hatred for his people or his ignorance of the law. Remember, the story never happened it was a TALE. The actual teachings of the Law is that saving a life is above Shabbath. In other words, it is commanded TO BRAKE SHABBATH in orther to save other's life. Someone asked if Jesus lied, well... A sin of omission by Jesus? The TALE of the Samaritan had a purpose, to perpetuate the idea that Jews cannot possible be close to G-d with their human-made rituals!

GlassOnion, Your last statement is true. Faith is never won by debate. I understand your faith in Jeus and its importance to you. I only addressed the questions based on the assumption that we were talking about the G-d of Israel, whom Jesus claimed to be. My approach is not to debate faith. I don't want you to change what you believe, nor I am suggesting that you should believe in a different way, your faith is yours and I respect that. Rather I am expressing my viewpoint based on Jewish idea of Whom is HaShem and then compare Him with Jesus to reach a conclusion. Isaiah 43:10-11 \"10 Ye are My witnesses [Israel], saith HaShem, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me [surely Jesus does not need to believe G-d if he is G-d], and understand that I am He; before Me there was no G-d formed, neither shall any be after Me. I, even I, am HaShem; and beside Me there is no saviour.\" Why did not HaShem use this opportunity to say:\"I am HaShem and beside Me and Jesus there is no savior\"? Greetings with respect, Ixcatzin",
