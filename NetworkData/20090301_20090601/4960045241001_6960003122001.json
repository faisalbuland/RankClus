He contended that Miller wasn't killed in a plane accident over the English Channel in 1944-- that was a story made up by the US govt. because they didn't want the public to know how he really died. Downs suggested that Miller, who spoke German, had been enlisted by Eisenhower to serve as a secret envoy, to try and convince some German officers to end the war early and offer terms of armistice.",
