Democratic Rep. Jim Moran said he has requested monthly updates from the Pentagon on the impact of the policy until it is repealed. In a statement released on Thursday, Moran said the discharged soldiers included an intelligence collector, a military police officer, four infantry personnel, a health care specialist, a motor-transport operator and a water-treatment specialist. \"How many more good soldiers are we willing to lose due to a bad policy that makes us less safe and secure?\" asked Moran, a member of the House panel that oversees military spending.
