The U.N. Procurement Task Force has accused Gary K. Helseth, an American who headed the U.N. Office for Project Services in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2006, of using the funds for lavish purchases, including first-class flights to Las Vegas and meals in posh restaurants in Copenhagen, Dubai, Florence and New York. Helseth oversaw more than $1 billion in reconstruction funds contributed by the U.S. and other international donors after the fall of the Taliban. The probe is a cautionary tale about the risks of lax U.N. financial controls in Afghanistan as the Obama administration presses for a more central role for the United Nations in coordinating rebuilding efforts there.
