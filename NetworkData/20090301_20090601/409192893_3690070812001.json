That is what I am sick and tired of. I think the outcry is present everyday - when it gets reported in the news that someone blew up a bunch of civilians, or the terrorists cut off someone's head. Doesn't the whole \"War on Terrorism\" equate to an outcry over what the terrorists are doing? I hate to agree with Knele, but doesn't the name terrorist indicate that we don't accept their methods? Of course there is going to be a significant outcry when we do something wrong. That comes with being 1) the aggressor, and 2) the party that claims to be on the side of righteousness. While I hate to see a soldier get dragged through the mud for some wrongdoing, or perceived wrongdoing, it is a necessary step to show that we do stand for righteousness and we can police ourselves. I always hope the soldier will be vindicated, but that is not always going to happen. We all know that soldiers are human and sometimes do things that require punishment. In those cases, we just have to hope the powers that be take into account the stress that we put on our soldiers every day and the situation in which they find themselves. Again, I am not digging on you as a person. I am just stating that when you present the \"but they do it to us\" argument, it appears that you are using that to justify us torturing the enemy even if that was not your intention. SCOUTS OUT!",

How come the Red Cross isn\u2019t concerned with this? I get so sick and tired of the \"well they do it, and worse, to us\" argument to justify why we should torture the enemy. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are the good guys because we actually follow rules (the Law of War and the Geneva Conventions). Although it might temporarily make you feel better, stooping to their level is not the way to do business. It makes us no better than they are. There are other arguments in favor of limited \"torture\" which have more merit than the above irrational argument. Even though I don't agree with those either, at least you could have an intelligent debate over them. Now, I am not placing any validity on this \"report\" until it can be seen in its entirety and the information contained therein verified. Just please do not try and justify us torturing the enemy based on the \"well they do it, and worse, to us\" argument. SCOUTS OUT! Sorry to disappoint you but I am not justifying us \"torturing\" the enemy. My point is that we (the good guys) receive all this whinnig, crying and finger pointing when we do something but when the enemy (the bad guys) do something there is no outcry as if what they did is OK. That is what I am sick and tired of. There are some people that will screem if we are accused of torture guilty or not. These same people seem never to be concerned if our prople are being tortured! I hope you are not implying that I am in that category of people (which is how I am reading your post). I am very concerned when our soldiers are captured that they will be tortured (especially since I am an active soldier who has deployed and will deploy again). Again, this is why the terrorists are the bad guys. Also, I stated that I would not accept this report as valid unless there is additional information. My point was simply that our soldiers being tortured does not justify us torturing the enemy. SCOUTS OUT!",
