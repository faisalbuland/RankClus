If you are leaving active service in the AMRY (Army) and are looking for this change, you'll first have to locate a Navy Reserve Unit and find out if they have any available slots. If there isn't a readily available position, they're sure not going to create one. If there is an available position, the unit may already be grooming someone to move into the slot - lining up schools, etc. - and won't want you coming in on top of that person, unless you have a whole lot of what they need right now... The disparity between Army training/jobs/requirements and Navy training/jobs/requirements could be a major problem - apples and oranges come to mind - - good luck - - Wandering and Wondering",

Administrative and leadership abilities can cut across all lines, but the above Lt. was coming from Ships to Tanks. There are a lot of commonalities there that he could relate to and step right in rhythm with. Plus he had a magnetic leadership quality and confidence, probably because of 6 years prior service enlisted, that made people want to work with/for him.
