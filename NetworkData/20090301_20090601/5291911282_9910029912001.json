Is there ANY way at all to get another base? One closer to home? For personal reasons my family probably wont come to FT Drum. Not to mention the lack of housing that I have read about. With deployment being on the horizon more then likely, id like to be able to leave my family by our family ect... So... Is there ANYWAY for me to swap duty stations? IE, anywhere in the southwest... FT Huaccua (spelling is wrong) possibly FT Bliss or Irwin?",

You can always file a request for Fort Huachuca, once you get to your next duty station. But I'd have to guess you're lucky you're not headed directly to Afghanistan, the way a lot of the kids I trained with went straight to Viet Nam out of AIT - - Wandering and Wondering",
