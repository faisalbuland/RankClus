At the end of the day on March 14, Olga was dealing with the last of her customers for the weekend when a man forced his way into the salon and demanded money. Other customers and employees at the establishment complied with his demands, but unbenounced to the robber, Olga just happened to be a yellow belt in karate. She overcame the robber and dragged him into the back room, then told everyone she would hold him until the police arrived. But Olga didn\u2019t call the police, in fact, after everyone had left, she went to the back room and demanded that the robber remove his clothing and underwear, telling him if he didn\u2019t do so she would hand him over to the police. He obeyed and, bound with a pair of pink furry handcuffs, spent the next 3 days at the mercy of Olga\u2019s perverse imagination. Monday morning before the hair salon reopened for business, the robber was freed and went directly to the hospital for treatment of injuries to his genitals. After leaving the hospital, he went to the police. Olga was hostile when arrested later that day, saying: \u201cWhat a *******. Yes, we had sex a couple of times. But I\u2019ve bought him new jeans, gave him food and even gave him 1.000 roubles (around $ 30) when he left.\u201d Both Olga and the robber Viktor have been charged and are awaiting sentencing.

He obeyed and, bound with a pair of pink furry handcuffs, spent the next 3 days at the mercy of Olga\u2019s perverse imagination. Monday morning before the hair salon reopened for business, the robber was freed and went directly to the hospital for treatment of injuries to his genitals. After leaving the hospital, he went to the police. Olga was hostile when arrested later that day, saying: \u201cWhat a *******. Yes, we had sex a couple of times. But I\u2019ve bought him new jeans, gave him food and even gave him 1.000 roubles (around $ 30) when he left.\u201d Both Olga and the robber Viktor have been charged and are awaiting sentencing.",
