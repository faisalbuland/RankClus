Why arnt the calling Buds training torture? Im sure every thing that seals go through in buds couldnt be considered voulentary? What about the US military in general? How is sitting in a cold room turture, but humping a logg that weighs hundreds of pounds in low degree water not torture? isnt there sleep deprivation in buds? Are we going to use a freedom of choice argument for suspects in our custody? Now they have a freedom of choice, and if they dont want to be in the cold they shouldnt? Why not flip the argument on its head and call for obama to end all U.S. military training if now being uncomfortable is torture. P.S. Is a cold MRE torture or does it depend on the flavor?",

        "content": "U.S. Soldiers Deeply Split Over Detainee Treatment, Senate Report Reveals A report on military interrogations reveals sharp debates about the morality of harsh techniques Buried in the newly released Senate Armed Services Committee report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody is a striking exchange that illustrates the deep reservations that many in the American military had about some of the harsh techniques that would later be used in prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan. The report also reveals that some had no reservations at all, and it comes amid new controversy over even harsher interrogation measures used by the CIA on high-level terrorism suspects. The U.S. military was never authorized to use the most radical of these methods, such as waterboarding, but soldiers were under pressure at certain periods in Iraq and Afghanistan to get more information from their interrogations of suspects. The Senate report quotes the response of Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer, then with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, to an E-mail that was sent by Capt. William Ponce, the battle captain in the Combined Joint Task Force 7's Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence Office in Iraq. In August 2003, Ponce had sent a message to others in the intelligence field asking them to submit their \"interrogation techniques wish lists.\" The commander of the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade in Iraq, Col. Thomas Pappas, told SASC committee staffers in October 2007 that he believed Ponce's E-mail was the result of a meeting Ponce had attended with Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, then the commander of coalition forces in Iraq. Ponce wrote: \"The gloves are coming off gentlemen regarding these detainees.\" He added that one colonel \"has made it clear that we want these individuals broken. Casualties are mounting and we need to start gathering info to help protect our fellow soldiers from any further attacks.\" As the SASC report describes it, Welshofer \"responded with his own assessment of the interrogation situation\": \"Today's enemy, particularly those in [Southwest Asia], understand force, not psychological mind games or incentives. I would propose a baseline interrogation technique that at a minimum allows for physical contact resembling that used by SERE schools (This allows open handed facial slaps from a distance of no more than about two feet and back handed blows to the midsection from a distance of about 18 inches. Again, this is open handed.) . . . Other techniques would include close confinement quarters, sleep deprivation, white noise, and a litany of harsher fear-up approaches . . . fear of dogs and snakes appear to work nicely. I firmly agree that the gloves need to come off.\" SERE is the Survival Evasion Resistance Escape training that many pilots and special-operations troops receive. Welshofer was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty in connection with the November 2003 killing of an Iraqi detainee. Maj. Nathan Hoepner had a difference response. Then the operations officer for the 501st Military Intelligence Battalion in Iraq, Hoepner strongly \"took issue with the language\" in Ponce's E-mail, according to the Senate committee's report. He wrote: \"As for 'the gloves need to come off . . . ' we need to take a deep breath and remember who we are.

        "reply": "U.S. Soldiers Deeply Split Over Detainee Treatment, Senate Report Reveals A report on military interrogations reveals sharp debates about the morality of harsh techniques Buried in the newly released Senate Armed Services Committee report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody is a striking exchange that illustrates the deep reservations that many in the American military had about some of the harsh techniques that would later be used in prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan. The report also reveals that some had no reservations at all, and it comes amid new controversy over even harsher interrogation measures used by the CIA on high-level terrorism suspects. The U.S. military was never authorized to use the most radical of these methods, such as waterboarding, but soldiers were under pressure at certain periods in Iraq and Afghanistan to get more information from their interrogations of suspects. The Senate report quotes the response of Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer, then with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, to an E-mail that was sent by Capt. William Ponce, the battle captain in the Combined Joint Task Force 7's Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence Office in Iraq. In August 2003, Ponce had sent a message to others in the intelligence field asking them to submit their \"interrogation techniques wish lists.\" The commander of the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade in Iraq, Col. Thomas Pappas, told SASC committee staffers in October 2007 that he believed Ponce's E-mail was the result of a meeting Ponce had attended with Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, then the commander of coalition forces in Iraq. Ponce wrote: \"The gloves are coming off gentlemen regarding these detainees.\" He added that one colonel \"has made it clear that we want these individuals broken. Casualties are mounting and we need to start gathering info to help protect our fellow soldiers from any further attacks.\" As the SASC report describes it, Welshofer \"responded with his own assessment of the interrogation situation\": \"Today's enemy, particularly those in [Southwest Asia], understand force, not psychological mind games or incentives. I would propose a baseline interrogation technique that at a minimum allows for physical contact resembling that used by SERE schools (This allows open handed facial slaps from a distance of no more than about two feet and back handed blows to the midsection from a distance of about 18 inches. Again, this is open handed.) . . . Other techniques would include close confinement quarters, sleep deprivation, white noise, and a litany of harsher fear-up approaches . . . fear of dogs and snakes appear to work nicely. I firmly agree that the gloves need to come off.\" SERE is the Survival Evasion Resistance Escape training that many pilots and special-operations troops receive. Welshofer was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty in connection with the November 2003 killing of an Iraqi detainee. Maj. Nathan Hoepner had a difference response.

He was damn lucky he got off as easy as he did. More than a \"few rotten apples\" U.S. soldier who tortured an Iraqi general to death got his wrist slapped. Yet his appalling sentence made a certain sense. By Brig. Gen. David Irvine and David Danzig Jan. 27, 2006 | Earlier this week at Fort Carson in Colorado, the military jury that heard charges of murder against Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer delivered a bold and stunning version of justice -- a sentence amounting to a slap on the wrist. Welshofer was on trial for the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush: After Mowhoush's capture in western Iraq in November 2003, Welshofer, an experienced Army interrogator, bound him and stuffed him in a sleeping bag, and then sat on Mowhoush's chest in an effort to pry from him information about the Iraqi insurgency. The Iraqi general suffocated. A jury trial always has three defendants: the accused, the prosecutor and the law. In this one, part of which we observed from the courtroom last week, the three captains, two majors and one lieutenant colonel on the jury spared the defendant, indicted the prosecutor, and found the law irrelevant. A primary aspect of Welshofer's defense was the claim that Welshofer had been operating under confusing guidelines, and that his superiors had been aware of the \"claustrophobic\" interrogation technique he used. With a verdict of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Welshofer, the jury spared him from a more serious murder conviction and life in prison. Even the lesser verdict could have carried a three-year prison sentence. But the jury imposed a sentence that called only for a letter of reprimand, two months' confinement to post, and forfeiture of $6,000 in pay. In essence, the jury took revenge upon the prosecution for wasting a week of the jurors' time by bringing a charge that the jury, evidently, felt was not warranted under the circumstances of combat. Stung by the photographs of torture from Abu Ghraib, the Army touts the vigor with which it is investigating and punishing soldiers who are found to have abused prisoners. Pentagon spokespeople regularly refer to \"more than 500 investigations and more than 300 instances of disciplinary action\" as a result. With this latest sentence in a homicide case, it's time to either drop the pretense and spend the trial money on more body armor, or get real about accountability for enforcing the laws of war. Juries are a check and balance in our system of justice. Military law does not allow the Welshofer jury to publicly explain its conclusions, but its sentencing decision was so disproportional to the facts in evidence and the spectrum of punishments for other instances of criminal conduct that it begs for careful analysis. It would be a mistake to conclude that the jury's light slap on Welshofer's wrist was a matter of a Fort Carson military jury looking out for a Fort Carson military officer. Prisoner torture is an issue about which the jury officers were undoubtedly well-read at this point, and of strong opinions. Those opinions remain unknown, but the Army ought to be digging for the answers. On the most elemental level, justice requires proportionality and comparability of punishment for criminal conduct of similar gravity. Could the jury have been unaware that three Abu Ghraib defendants -- who, unlike Welshofer, didn't kill anyone -- are serving prison terms of three, eight and 10 years? Is there a different standard of punishment for junior enlisted reservists versus senior regular Army warrant officers? While she acted inexcusably, Pvt. Lynndie England had received little to no training for her guard duties at Abu Ghraib; Welshofer, 43, was thoroughly trained as an Army interrogator and in what the Geneva Conventions require and allow. England will spend three years in the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth; Welshofer, vastly senior in status, responsibility and experience, wasn't even confined to his quarters. Until the Army can explain how Welshofer's sentence meets a minimal standard of equal justice under the law, the disciplinary score card it trots out is meaningless. The jury's decision also underscores the pattern in the Army and at the Pentagon of enforcing accountability for prisoner torture at the bottom of the ranks, without any serious effort to enforce it at the top. If Welshofer was singled out by prosecutors for \"trying to save soldiers' lives\" under ambiguous or contradictory command guidance -- which his defense attorneys hammered at over and over during the court martial -- why hasn't the Army focused its prosecutorial lasers on those generals who fumbled the command guidance, or upon those colonels who were responsible for seeing that only approved interrogation techniques were put to use? One striking fact to come out of the Welshofer trial was that he was operating on his own, with little direct supervision by his company commander, or the commanders up the chain of command. Were the jurors aware that of all the generals whose fingerprints were on Abu Ghraib, only one was ever disciplined by receiving a reduction in rank to colonel? Was it lost upon the jurors that the regimental commander, for whom Welshofer was his prized interrogation \"subject-matter expert,\" was now serving in a plum Pentagon post while Welshofer was facing life in prison? This juxtaposition surely must have seemed discordant to the jury, especially knowing that the Army Field Manual -- also known as the Army's \"operations bible\" -- states: The commander is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do. It may also have seemed discordant that an Army warrant officer alone was in the dock for alleged brutality and torture when \"other U.S. civilians\" involved in Mowhoush's capture -- presumably meaning CIA personnel and the Iraqi paramilitaries in their employ -- severely beat an enemy army flag officer, who was clearly entitled to Geneva Conventions protections, within an inch of his life. The Welshofer case puts a fine point on a question that has plagued us since Abu Ghraib: Is the Army institutionally capable of dealing with the debacle of torture? The Army and the nation cannot afford to have soldiers draw the obvious lesson from the case's nonsensical outcome: that in combat, the ends justify the means, and the Geneva Conventions and the McCain anti-torture amendment are subject to change depending on the circumstances or executive whim. Since the Army seems to have no inclination to enforce the principles of command discipline and accountability among the senior ranks, the corrosive effects of U.S. torture in Iraq and elsewhere will continue to haunt any efforts to regain lost stature and credibility in the world. \"I deeply apologize if my actions tarnished the soldiers serving in Iraq,\" Welshofer said to the jury at his trial's close. His actions -- and even more the military's woefully inadequate response to them -- have tarnished far more than that. Brig. Gen. David R. Irvine is a retired Army Reserve strategic intelligence officer who taught prisoner interrogation and military law for 18 years with the Sixth Army Intelligence School. http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/01/27/welshofer/ \"We are America!\" \"I don't give a rat's ass if it helps.

And not a very high price at that. He was damn lucky he got off as easy as he did. More than a \"few rotten apples\" U.S. soldier who tortured an Iraqi general to death got his wrist slapped. Yet his appalling sentence made a certain sense. By Brig. Gen. David Irvine and David Danzig Jan. 27, 2006 | Earlier this week at Fort Carson in Colorado, the military jury that heard charges of murder against Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer delivered a bold and stunning version of justice -- a sentence amounting to a slap on the wrist. Welshofer was on trial for the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush: After Mowhoush's capture in western Iraq in November 2003, Welshofer, an experienced Army interrogator, bound him and stuffed him in a sleeping bag, and then sat on Mowhoush's chest in an effort to pry from him information about the Iraqi insurgency. The Iraqi general suffocated. A jury trial always has three defendants: the accused, the prosecutor and the law. In this one, part of which we observed from the courtroom last week, the three captains, two majors and one lieutenant colonel on the jury spared the defendant, indicted the prosecutor, and found the law irrelevant. A primary aspect of Welshofer's defense was the claim that Welshofer had been operating under confusing guidelines, and that his superiors had been aware of the \"claustrophobic\" interrogation technique he used. With a verdict of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Welshofer, the jury spared him from a more serious murder conviction and life in prison. Even the lesser verdict could have carried a three-year prison sentence. But the jury imposed a sentence that called only for a letter of reprimand, two months' confinement to post, and forfeiture of $6,000 in pay. In essence, the jury took revenge upon the prosecution for wasting a week of the jurors' time by bringing a charge that the jury, evidently, felt was not warranted under the circumstances of combat. Stung by the photographs of torture from Abu Ghraib, the Army touts the vigor with which it is investigating and punishing soldiers who are found to have abused prisoners. Pentagon spokespeople regularly refer to \"more than 500 investigations and more than 300 instances of disciplinary action\" as a result. With this latest sentence in a homicide case, it's time to either drop the pretense and spend the trial money on more body armor, or get real about accountability for enforcing the laws of war. Juries are a check and balance in our system of justice. Military law does not allow the Welshofer jury to publicly explain its conclusions, but its sentencing decision was so disproportional to the facts in evidence and the spectrum of punishments for other instances of criminal conduct that it begs for careful analysis. It would be a mistake to conclude that the jury's light slap on Welshofer's wrist was a matter of a Fort Carson military jury looking out for a Fort Carson military officer. Prisoner torture is an issue about which the jury officers were undoubtedly well-read at this point, and of strong opinions. Those opinions remain unknown, but the Army ought to be digging for the answers. On the most elemental level, justice requires proportionality and comparability of punishment for criminal conduct of similar gravity. Could the jury have been unaware that three Abu Ghraib defendants -- who, unlike Welshofer, didn't kill anyone -- are serving prison terms of three, eight and 10 years? Is there a different standard of punishment for junior enlisted reservists versus senior regular Army warrant officers? While she acted inexcusably, Pvt. Lynndie England had received little to no training for her guard duties at Abu Ghraib; Welshofer, 43, was thoroughly trained as an Army interrogator and in what the Geneva Conventions require and allow. England will spend three years in the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth; Welshofer, vastly senior in status, responsibility and experience, wasn't even confined to his quarters. Until the Army can explain how Welshofer's sentence meets a minimal standard of equal justice under the law, the disciplinary score card it trots out is meaningless. The jury's decision also underscores the pattern in the Army and at the Pentagon of enforcing accountability for prisoner torture at the bottom of the ranks, without any serious effort to enforce it at the top. If Welshofer was singled out by prosecutors for \"trying to save soldiers' lives\" under ambiguous or contradictory command guidance -- which his defense attorneys hammered at over and over during the court martial -- why hasn't the Army focused its prosecutorial lasers on those generals who fumbled the command guidance, or upon those colonels who were responsible for seeing that only approved interrogation techniques were put to use? One striking fact to come out of the Welshofer trial was that he was operating on his own, with little direct supervision by his company commander, or the commanders up the chain of command. Were the jurors aware that of all the generals whose fingerprints were on Abu Ghraib, only one was ever disciplined by receiving a reduction in rank to colonel? Was it lost upon the jurors that the regimental commander, for whom Welshofer was his prized interrogation \"subject-matter expert,\" was now serving in a plum Pentagon post while Welshofer was facing life in prison? This juxtaposition surely must have seemed discordant to the jury, especially knowing that the Army Field Manual -- also known as the Army's \"operations bible\" -- states: The commander is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do. It may also have seemed discordant that an Army warrant officer alone was in the dock for alleged brutality and torture when \"other U.S. civilians\" involved in Mowhoush's capture -- presumably meaning CIA personnel and the Iraqi paramilitaries in their employ -- severely beat an enemy army flag officer, who was clearly entitled to Geneva Conventions protections, within an inch of his life. The Welshofer case puts a fine point on a question that has plagued us since Abu Ghraib: Is the Army institutionally capable of dealing with the debacle of torture? The Army and the nation cannot afford to have soldiers draw the obvious lesson from the case's nonsensical outcome: that in combat, the ends justify the means, and the Geneva Conventions and the McCain anti-torture amendment are subject to change depending on the circumstances or executive whim.

The report also reveals that some had no reservations at all, and it comes amid new controversy over even harsher interrogation measures used by the CIA on high-level terrorism suspects. The U.S. military was never authorized to use the most radical of these methods, such as waterboarding, but soldiers were under pressure at certain periods in Iraq and Afghanistan to get more information from their interrogations of suspects. The Senate report quotes the response of Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer, then with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, to an E-mail that was sent by Capt. William Ponce, the battle captain in the Combined Joint Task Force 7's Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence Office in Iraq. In August 2003, Ponce had sent a message to others in the intelligence field asking them to submit their \"interrogation techniques wish lists.\" The commander of the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade in Iraq, Col. Thomas Pappas, told SASC committee staffers in October 2007 that he believed Ponce's E-mail was the result of a meeting Ponce had attended with Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, then the commander of coalition forces in Iraq. Ponce wrote: \"The gloves are coming off gentlemen regarding these detainees.\" He added that one colonel \"has made it clear that we want these individuals broken. Casualties are mounting and we need to start gathering info to help protect our fellow soldiers from any further attacks.\" As the SASC report describes it, Welshofer \"responded with his own assessment of the interrogation situation\": \"Today's enemy, particularly those in [Southwest Asia], understand force, not psychological mind games or incentives. I would propose a baseline interrogation technique that at a minimum allows for physical contact resembling that used by SERE schools (This allows open handed facial slaps from a distance of no more than about two feet and back handed blows to the midsection from a distance of about 18 inches. Again, this is open handed.) . . . Other techniques would include close confinement quarters, sleep deprivation, white noise, and a litany of harsher fear-up approaches . . . fear of dogs and snakes appear to work nicely. I firmly agree that the gloves need to come off.\" SERE is the Survival Evasion Resistance Escape training that many pilots and special-operations troops receive. Welshofer was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty in connection with the November 2003 killing of an Iraqi detainee. Maj. Nathan Hoepner had a difference response. Then the operations officer for the 501st Military Intelligence Battalion in Iraq, Hoepner strongly \"took issue with the language\" in Ponce's E-mail, according to the Senate committee's report. He wrote: \"As for 'the gloves need to come off . . . ' we need to take a deep breath and remember who we are. Those gloves are most definitely NOT based on Cold War or WWII enemies--they are based on clearly established standards of international law to which we are signatories and in part the originators. Those in turn derive from practices commonly accepted as morally correct, the so-called 'usages of war.' It comes down to standards of right and wrong--something we cannot just put aside when we find it inconvenient, any more than we can declare that we will 'take no prisoners' and therefore shoot those who surrender to us simply because we find prisoners inconvenient.\" In response to Ponce's remark that \"casualties are mounting,\" Hoepner wrote: \"We have taken casualties in every war we have ever fought--that is part of the very nature of war. We also inflict casualties, generally more than we take. That in no way justifies letting go of our standards. We have NEVER considered our enemies justified in doing such things to us.

The Senate report quotes the response of Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer, then with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, to an E-mail that was sent by Capt. William Ponce, the battle captain in the Combined Joint Task Force 7's Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence Office in Iraq. In August 2003, Ponce had sent a message to others in the intelligence field asking them to submit their \"interrogation techniques wish lists.\" The commander of the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade in Iraq, Col. Thomas Pappas, told SASC committee staffers in October 2007 that he believed Ponce's E-mail was the result of a meeting Ponce had attended with Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, then the commander of coalition forces in Iraq. Ponce wrote: \"The gloves are coming off gentlemen regarding these detainees.\" He added that one colonel \"has made it clear that we want these individuals broken. Casualties are mounting and we need to start gathering info to help protect our fellow soldiers from any further attacks.\" As the SASC report describes it, Welshofer \"responded with his own assessment of the interrogation situation\": \"Today's enemy, particularly those in [Southwest Asia], understand force, not psychological mind games or incentives. I would propose a baseline interrogation technique that at a minimum allows for physical contact resembling that used by SERE schools (This allows open handed facial slaps from a distance of no more than about two feet and back handed blows to the midsection from a distance of about 18 inches. Again, this is open handed.) . . . Other techniques would include close confinement quarters, sleep deprivation, white noise, and a litany of harsher fear-up approaches . . . fear of dogs and snakes appear to work nicely. I firmly agree that the gloves need to come off.\" SERE is the Survival Evasion Resistance Escape training that many pilots and special-operations troops receive. Welshofer was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty in connection with the November 2003 killing of an Iraqi detainee. Maj. Nathan Hoepner had a difference response. Then the operations officer for the 501st Military Intelligence Battalion in Iraq, Hoepner strongly \"took issue with the language\" in Ponce's E-mail, according to the Senate committee's report. He wrote: \"As for 'the gloves need to come off . . . ' we need to take a deep breath and remember who we are. Those gloves are most definitely NOT based on Cold War or WWII enemies--they are based on clearly established standards of international law to which we are signatories and in part the originators. Those in turn derive from practices commonly accepted as morally correct, the so-called 'usages of war.' It comes down to standards of right and wrong--something we cannot just put aside when we find it inconvenient, any more than we can declare that we will 'take no prisoners' and therefore shoot those who surrender to us simply because we find prisoners inconvenient.\" In response to Ponce's remark that \"casualties are mounting,\" Hoepner wrote: \"We have taken casualties in every war we have ever fought--that is part of the very nature of war. We also inflict casualties, generally more than we take. That in no way justifies letting go of our standards. We have NEVER considered our enemies justified in doing such things to us.

He was damn lucky he got off as easy as he did. More than a \"few rotten apples\" U.S. soldier who tortured an Iraqi general to death got his wrist slapped. Yet his appalling sentence made a certain sense. By Brig. Gen. David Irvine and David Danzig Jan. 27, 2006 | Earlier this week at Fort Carson in Colorado, the military jury that heard charges of murder against Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer delivered a bold and stunning version of justice -- a sentence amounting to a slap on the wrist. Welshofer was on trial for the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush: After Mowhoush's capture in western Iraq in November 2003, Welshofer, an experienced Army interrogator, bound him and stuffed him in a sleeping bag, and then sat on Mowhoush's chest in an effort to pry from him information about the Iraqi insurgency. The Iraqi general suffocated. A jury trial always has three defendants: the accused, the prosecutor and the law. In this one, part of which we observed from the courtroom last week, the three captains, two majors and one lieutenant colonel on the jury spared the defendant, indicted the prosecutor, and found the law irrelevant. A primary aspect of Welshofer's defense was the claim that Welshofer had been operating under confusing guidelines, and that his superiors had been aware of the \"claustrophobic\" interrogation technique he used. With a verdict of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Welshofer, the jury spared him from a more serious murder conviction and life in prison. Even the lesser verdict could have carried a three-year prison sentence. But the jury imposed a sentence that called only for a letter of reprimand, two months' confinement to post, and forfeiture of $6,000 in pay. In essence, the jury took revenge upon the prosecution for wasting a week of the jurors' time by bringing a charge that the jury, evidently, felt was not warranted under the circumstances of combat. Stung by the photographs of torture from Abu Ghraib, the Army touts the vigor with which it is investigating and punishing soldiers who are found to have abused prisoners. Pentagon spokespeople regularly refer to \"more than 500 investigations and more than 300 instances of disciplinary action\" as a result. With this latest sentence in a homicide case, it's time to either drop the pretense and spend the trial money on more body armor, or get real about accountability for enforcing the laws of war. Juries are a check and balance in our system of justice. Military law does not allow the Welshofer jury to publicly explain its conclusions, but its sentencing decision was so disproportional to the facts in evidence and the spectrum of punishments for other instances of criminal conduct that it begs for careful analysis. It would be a mistake to conclude that the jury's light slap on Welshofer's wrist was a matter of a Fort Carson military jury looking out for a Fort Carson military officer. Prisoner torture is an issue about which the jury officers were undoubtedly well-read at this point, and of strong opinions. Those opinions remain unknown, but the Army ought to be digging for the answers. On the most elemental level, justice requires proportionality and comparability of punishment for criminal conduct of similar gravity. Could the jury have been unaware that three Abu Ghraib defendants -- who, unlike Welshofer, didn't kill anyone -- are serving prison terms of three, eight and 10 years? Is there a different standard of punishment for junior enlisted reservists versus senior regular Army warrant officers? While she acted inexcusably, Pvt. Lynndie England had received little to no training for her guard duties at Abu Ghraib; Welshofer, 43, was thoroughly trained as an Army interrogator and in what the Geneva Conventions require and allow. England will spend three years in the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth; Welshofer, vastly senior in status, responsibility and experience, wasn't even confined to his quarters. Until the Army can explain how Welshofer's sentence meets a minimal standard of equal justice under the law, the disciplinary score card it trots out is meaningless. The jury's decision also underscores the pattern in the Army and at the Pentagon of enforcing accountability for prisoner torture at the bottom of the ranks, without any serious effort to enforce it at the top. If Welshofer was singled out by prosecutors for \"trying to save soldiers' lives\" under ambiguous or contradictory command guidance -- which his defense attorneys hammered at over and over during the court martial -- why hasn't the Army focused its prosecutorial lasers on those generals who fumbled the command guidance, or upon those colonels who were responsible for seeing that only approved interrogation techniques were put to use? One striking fact to come out of the Welshofer trial was that he was operating on his own, with little direct supervision by his company commander, or the commanders up the chain of command. Were the jurors aware that of all the generals whose fingerprints were on Abu Ghraib, only one was ever disciplined by receiving a reduction in rank to colonel? Was it lost upon the jurors that the regimental commander, for whom Welshofer was his prized interrogation \"subject-matter expert,\" was now serving in a plum Pentagon post while Welshofer was facing life in prison? This juxtaposition surely must have seemed discordant to the jury, especially knowing that the Army Field Manual -- also known as the Army's \"operations bible\" -- states: The commander is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do. It may also have seemed discordant that an Army warrant officer alone was in the dock for alleged brutality and torture when \"other U.S. civilians\" involved in Mowhoush's capture -- presumably meaning CIA personnel and the Iraqi paramilitaries in their employ -- severely beat an enemy army flag officer, who was clearly entitled to Geneva Conventions protections, within an inch of his life. The Welshofer case puts a fine point on a question that has plagued us since Abu Ghraib: Is the Army institutionally capable of dealing with the debacle of torture? The Army and the nation cannot afford to have soldiers draw the obvious lesson from the case's nonsensical outcome: that in combat, the ends justify the means, and the Geneva Conventions and the McCain anti-torture amendment are subject to change depending on the circumstances or executive whim. Since the Army seems to have no inclination to enforce the principles of command discipline and accountability among the senior ranks, the corrosive effects of U.S. torture in Iraq and elsewhere will continue to haunt any efforts to regain lost stature and credibility in the world. \"I deeply apologize if my actions tarnished the soldiers serving in Iraq,\" Welshofer said to the jury at his trial's close. His actions -- and even more the military's woefully inadequate response to them -- have tarnished far more than that. Brig. Gen. David R. Irvine is a retired Army Reserve strategic intelligence officer who taught prisoner interrogation and military law for 18 years with the Sixth Army Intelligence School. http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/01/27/welshofer/ \"We are America!\" \"I don't give a rat's ass if it helps.

        "quote": "Originally posted by jdksfcret: Oh puleeeeaaassseee, what? If you got a counter point. Lets hear it. The WO went against the regulations and paid the price. And not a very high price at that. He was damn lucky he got off as easy as he did. More than a \"few rotten apples\" U.S. soldier who tortured an Iraqi general to death got his wrist slapped. Yet his appalling sentence made a certain sense. By Brig. Gen. David Irvine and David Danzig Jan. 27, 2006 | Earlier this week at Fort Carson in Colorado, the military jury that heard charges of murder against Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer delivered a bold and stunning version of justice -- a sentence amounting to a slap on the wrist. Welshofer was on trial for the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush: After Mowhoush's capture in western Iraq in November 2003, Welshofer, an experienced Army interrogator, bound him and stuffed him in a sleeping bag, and then sat on Mowhoush's chest in an effort to pry from him information about the Iraqi insurgency. The Iraqi general suffocated. A jury trial always has three defendants: the accused, the prosecutor and the law. In this one, part of which we observed from the courtroom last week, the three captains, two majors and one lieutenant colonel on the jury spared the defendant, indicted the prosecutor, and found the law irrelevant. A primary aspect of Welshofer's defense was the claim that Welshofer had been operating under confusing guidelines, and that his superiors had been aware of the \"claustrophobic\" interrogation technique he used. With a verdict of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Welshofer, the jury spared him from a more serious murder conviction and life in prison. Even the lesser verdict could have carried a three-year prison sentence. But the jury imposed a sentence that called only for a letter of reprimand, two months' confinement to post, and forfeiture of $6,000 in pay. In essence, the jury took revenge upon the prosecution for wasting a week of the jurors' time by bringing a charge that the jury, evidently, felt was not warranted under the circumstances of combat. Stung by the photographs of torture from Abu Ghraib, the Army touts the vigor with which it is investigating and punishing soldiers who are found to have abused prisoners. Pentagon spokespeople regularly refer to \"more than 500 investigations and more than 300 instances of disciplinary action\" as a result. With this latest sentence in a homicide case, it's time to either drop the pretense and spend the trial money on more body armor, or get real about accountability for enforcing the laws of war. Juries are a check and balance in our system of justice. Military law does not allow the Welshofer jury to publicly explain its conclusions, but its sentencing decision was so disproportional to the facts in evidence and the spectrum of punishments for other instances of criminal conduct that it begs for careful analysis. It would be a mistake to conclude that the jury's light slap on Welshofer's wrist was a matter of a Fort Carson military jury looking out for a Fort Carson military officer. Prisoner torture is an issue about which the jury officers were undoubtedly well-read at this point, and of strong opinions. Those opinions remain unknown, but the Army ought to be digging for the answers. On the most elemental level, justice requires proportionality and comparability of punishment for criminal conduct of similar gravity. Could the jury have been unaware that three Abu Ghraib defendants -- who, unlike Welshofer, didn't kill anyone -- are serving prison terms of three, eight and 10 years? Is there a different standard of punishment for junior enlisted reservists versus senior regular Army warrant officers? While she acted inexcusably, Pvt. Lynndie England had received little to no training for her guard duties at Abu Ghraib; Welshofer, 43, was thoroughly trained as an Army interrogator and in what the Geneva Conventions require and allow. England will spend three years in the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth; Welshofer, vastly senior in status, responsibility and experience, wasn't even confined to his quarters. Until the Army can explain how Welshofer's sentence meets a minimal standard of equal justice under the law, the disciplinary score card it trots out is meaningless. The jury's decision also underscores the pattern in the Army and at the Pentagon of enforcing accountability for prisoner torture at the bottom of the ranks, without any serious effort to enforce it at the top. If Welshofer was singled out by prosecutors for \"trying to save soldiers' lives\" under ambiguous or contradictory command guidance -- which his defense attorneys hammered at over and over during the court martial -- why hasn't the Army focused its prosecutorial lasers on those generals who fumbled the command guidance, or upon those colonels who were responsible for seeing that only approved interrogation techniques were put to use? One striking fact to come out of the Welshofer trial was that he was operating on his own, with little direct supervision by his company commander, or the commanders up the chain of command. Were the jurors aware that of all the generals whose fingerprints were on Abu Ghraib, only one was ever disciplined by receiving a reduction in rank to colonel? Was it lost upon the jurors that the regimental commander, for whom Welshofer was his prized interrogation \"subject-matter expert,\" was now serving in a plum Pentagon post while Welshofer was facing life in prison? This juxtaposition surely must have seemed discordant to the jury, especially knowing that the Army Field Manual -- also known as the Army's \"operations bible\" -- states: The commander is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do. It may also have seemed discordant that an Army warrant officer alone was in the dock for alleged brutality and torture when \"other U.S. civilians\" involved in Mowhoush's capture -- presumably meaning CIA personnel and the Iraqi paramilitaries in their employ -- severely beat an enemy army flag officer, who was clearly entitled to Geneva Conventions protections, within an inch of his life. The Welshofer case puts a fine point on a question that has plagued us since Abu Ghraib: Is the Army institutionally capable of dealing with the debacle of torture? The Army and the nation cannot afford to have soldiers draw the obvious lesson from the case's nonsensical outcome: that in combat, the ends justify the means, and the Geneva Conventions and the McCain anti-torture amendment are subject to change depending on the circumstances or executive whim. Since the Army seems to have no inclination to enforce the principles of command discipline and accountability among the senior ranks, the corrosive effects of U.S. torture in Iraq and elsewhere will continue to haunt any efforts to regain lost stature and credibility in the world. \"I deeply apologize if my actions tarnished the soldiers serving in Iraq,\" Welshofer said to the jury at his trial's close. His actions -- and even more the military's woefully inadequate response to them -- have tarnished far more than that. Brig. Gen. David R.

Youd dont see me making a point here? does seal training walk a fine line between compulsary and voulentary, or am I missing somthing? why cant we treat detanees any differnt than we treat GIs? Make them hump a log till they tell us what we want. Make them sleep deprived like we do seals. whats wrong with that? I under stand that your uniformed and have to walk the line, so Im not asking you to not parrot what the offical line is, Im jsut making a valid point I feel.

How about right vs wrong instead of right vs left? It's funny how the right wing has evolved their stand on the torture debate over the last couple years. First the argument was \"torture was not widespread\" Then the argument became \"the torture was limited to a few bad apples\" Now it's \"Waterboarding is not really torture\" or even worse \"We torture because it works\" How embarrassing for the United States.

The report also reveals that some had no reservations at all, and it comes amid new controversy over even harsher interrogation measures used by the CIA on high-level terrorism suspects. The U.S. military was never authorized to use the most radical of these methods, such as waterboarding, but soldiers were under pressure at certain periods in Iraq and Afghanistan to get more information from their interrogations of suspects. The Senate report quotes the response of Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer, then with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, to an E-mail that was sent by Capt. William Ponce, the battle captain in the Combined Joint Task Force 7's Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence Office in Iraq. In August 2003, Ponce had sent a message to others in the intelligence field asking them to submit their \"interrogation techniques wish lists.\" The commander of the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade in Iraq, Col. Thomas Pappas, told SASC committee staffers in October 2007 that he believed Ponce's E-mail was the result of a meeting Ponce had attended with Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, then the commander of coalition forces in Iraq. Ponce wrote: \"The gloves are coming off gentlemen regarding these detainees.\" He added that one colonel \"has made it clear that we want these individuals broken. Casualties are mounting and we need to start gathering info to help protect our fellow soldiers from any further attacks.\" As the SASC report describes it, Welshofer \"responded with his own assessment of the interrogation situation\": \"Today's enemy, particularly those in [Southwest Asia], understand force, not psychological mind games or incentives. I would propose a baseline interrogation technique that at a minimum allows for physical contact resembling that used by SERE schools (This allows open handed facial slaps from a distance of no more than about two feet and back handed blows to the midsection from a distance of about 18 inches. Again, this is open handed.) . . . Other techniques would include close confinement quarters, sleep deprivation, white noise, and a litany of harsher fear-up approaches . . . fear of dogs and snakes appear to work nicely. I firmly agree that the gloves need to come off.\" SERE is the Survival Evasion Resistance Escape training that many pilots and special-operations troops receive. Welshofer was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty in connection with the November 2003 killing of an Iraqi detainee. Maj. Nathan Hoepner had a difference response. Then the operations officer for the 501st Military Intelligence Battalion in Iraq, Hoepner strongly \"took issue with the language\" in Ponce's E-mail, according to the Senate committee's report. He wrote: \"As for 'the gloves need to come off . . . ' we need to take a deep breath and remember who we are. Those gloves are most definitely NOT based on Cold War or WWII enemies--they are based on clearly established standards of international law to which we are signatories and in part the originators. Those in turn derive from practices commonly accepted as morally correct, the so-called 'usages of war.' It comes down to standards of right and wrong--something we cannot just put aside when we find it inconvenient, any more than we can declare that we will 'take no prisoners' and therefore shoot those who surrender to us simply because we find prisoners inconvenient.\" In response to Ponce's remark that \"casualties are mounting,\" Hoepner wrote: \"We have taken casualties in every war we have ever fought--that is part of the very nature of war. We also inflict casualties, generally more than we take. That in no way justifies letting go of our standards. We have NEVER considered our enemies justified in doing such things to us.

It comes down to standards of right and wrong--something we cannot just put aside when we find it inconvenient, any more than we can declare that we will 'take no prisoners' and therefore shoot those who surrender to us simply because we find prisoners inconvenient.\" In response to Ponce's remark that \"casualties are mounting,\" Hoepner wrote: \"We have taken casualties in every war we have ever fought--that is part of the very nature of war. We also inflict casualties, generally more than we take. That in no way justifies letting go of our standards. We have NEVER considered our enemies justified in doing such things to us. Casualties are part of war--if you cannot take casualties then you cannot engage in war. Period. \"BOTTOM LINE: We are American soldiers, heirs of a long tradition of staying on the high ground. We need to stay there.\" http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2009/04/22/us-soldiers-deeply-split-over-detainee-treatment-senate-report-reveals.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a41:g29:r15:c0.022640:b23950098&s_cid=loomia:bush-lawyers-used-us-military-training-to-justify-cia-interrogation-techniques",

He was damn lucky he got off as easy as he did. More than a \"few rotten apples\" U.S. soldier who tortured an Iraqi general to death got his wrist slapped. Yet his appalling sentence made a certain sense. By Brig. Gen. David Irvine and David Danzig Jan. 27, 2006 | Earlier this week at Fort Carson in Colorado, the military jury that heard charges of murder against Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer delivered a bold and stunning version of justice -- a sentence amounting to a slap on the wrist. Welshofer was on trial for the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush: After Mowhoush's capture in western Iraq in November 2003, Welshofer, an experienced Army interrogator, bound him and stuffed him in a sleeping bag, and then sat on Mowhoush's chest in an effort to pry from him information about the Iraqi insurgency. The Iraqi general suffocated. A jury trial always has three defendants: the accused, the prosecutor and the law. In this one, part of which we observed from the courtroom last week, the three captains, two majors and one lieutenant colonel on the jury spared the defendant, indicted the prosecutor, and found the law irrelevant. A primary aspect of Welshofer's defense was the claim that Welshofer had been operating under confusing guidelines, and that his superiors had been aware of the \"claustrophobic\" interrogation technique he used. With a verdict of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Welshofer, the jury spared him from a more serious murder conviction and life in prison. Even the lesser verdict could have carried a three-year prison sentence. But the jury imposed a sentence that called only for a letter of reprimand, two months' confinement to post, and forfeiture of $6,000 in pay. In essence, the jury took revenge upon the prosecution for wasting a week of the jurors' time by bringing a charge that the jury, evidently, felt was not warranted under the circumstances of combat. Stung by the photographs of torture from Abu Ghraib, the Army touts the vigor with which it is investigating and punishing soldiers who are found to have abused prisoners. Pentagon spokespeople regularly refer to \"more than 500 investigations and more than 300 instances of disciplinary action\" as a result. With this latest sentence in a homicide case, it's time to either drop the pretense and spend the trial money on more body armor, or get real about accountability for enforcing the laws of war. Juries are a check and balance in our system of justice. Military law does not allow the Welshofer jury to publicly explain its conclusions, but its sentencing decision was so disproportional to the facts in evidence and the spectrum of punishments for other instances of criminal conduct that it begs for careful analysis. It would be a mistake to conclude that the jury's light slap on Welshofer's wrist was a matter of a Fort Carson military jury looking out for a Fort Carson military officer. Prisoner torture is an issue about which the jury officers were undoubtedly well-read at this point, and of strong opinions. Those opinions remain unknown, but the Army ought to be digging for the answers. On the most elemental level, justice requires proportionality and comparability of punishment for criminal conduct of similar gravity. Could the jury have been unaware that three Abu Ghraib defendants -- who, unlike Welshofer, didn't kill anyone -- are serving prison terms of three, eight and 10 years? Is there a different standard of punishment for junior enlisted reservists versus senior regular Army warrant officers? While she acted inexcusably, Pvt. Lynndie England had received little to no training for her guard duties at Abu Ghraib; Welshofer, 43, was thoroughly trained as an Army interrogator and in what the Geneva Conventions require and allow. England will spend three years in the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth; Welshofer, vastly senior in status, responsibility and experience, wasn't even confined to his quarters. Until the Army can explain how Welshofer's sentence meets a minimal standard of equal justice under the law, the disciplinary score card it trots out is meaningless. The jury's decision also underscores the pattern in the Army and at the Pentagon of enforcing accountability for prisoner torture at the bottom of the ranks, without any serious effort to enforce it at the top. If Welshofer was singled out by prosecutors for \"trying to save soldiers' lives\" under ambiguous or contradictory command guidance -- which his defense attorneys hammered at over and over during the court martial -- why hasn't the Army focused its prosecutorial lasers on those generals who fumbled the command guidance, or upon those colonels who were responsible for seeing that only approved interrogation techniques were put to use? One striking fact to come out of the Welshofer trial was that he was operating on his own, with little direct supervision by his company commander, or the commanders up the chain of command. Were the jurors aware that of all the generals whose fingerprints were on Abu Ghraib, only one was ever disciplined by receiving a reduction in rank to colonel? Was it lost upon the jurors that the regimental commander, for whom Welshofer was his prized interrogation \"subject-matter expert,\" was now serving in a plum Pentagon post while Welshofer was facing life in prison? This juxtaposition surely must have seemed discordant to the jury, especially knowing that the Army Field Manual -- also known as the Army's \"operations bible\" -- states: The commander is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do. It may also have seemed discordant that an Army warrant officer alone was in the dock for alleged brutality and torture when \"other U.S. civilians\" involved in Mowhoush's capture -- presumably meaning CIA personnel and the Iraqi paramilitaries in their employ -- severely beat an enemy army flag officer, who was clearly entitled to Geneva Conventions protections, within an inch of his life. The Welshofer case puts a fine point on a question that has plagued us since Abu Ghraib: Is the Army institutionally capable of dealing with the debacle of torture? The Army and the nation cannot afford to have soldiers draw the obvious lesson from the case's nonsensical outcome: that in combat, the ends justify the means, and the Geneva Conventions and the McCain anti-torture amendment are subject to change depending on the circumstances or executive whim. Since the Army seems to have no inclination to enforce the principles of command discipline and accountability among the senior ranks, the corrosive effects of U.S. torture in Iraq and elsewhere will continue to haunt any efforts to regain lost stature and credibility in the world. \"I deeply apologize if my actions tarnished the soldiers serving in Iraq,\" Welshofer said to the jury at his trial's close. His actions -- and even more the military's woefully inadequate response to them -- have tarnished far more than that. Brig. Gen. David R. Irvine is a retired Army Reserve strategic intelligence officer who taught prisoner interrogation and military law for 18 years with the Sixth Army Intelligence School. http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/01/27/welshofer/ \"We are America!\" \"I don't give a rat's ass if it helps.
