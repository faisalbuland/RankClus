About 350 people who came to Washington to support talks between the Obama administration and representatives of people with disabilities wound up demonstrating after the group learned the president was not going to support parts of a bill he had promised to support during the campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of putting forth and taking back,\u201d Smock said. \u201cHe made a lot of promises, and he\u2019s failed to live up to those promises.\u201d The day of demonstrations got off to an early morning start. Seven Greenpeace activists were arrested after hanging a 600-foot banner from a construction crane near the U.S. State Department. The environmental protesters closed 23rd Street NW between C Street and Constitution Avenue and hung the banner to send a message to world leaders who were attending a meeting on climate change, protest organizers said. The banner showed a picture of the Earth and read, \u201cToo Big To Fail: Stop Global Warming, Rescue the Planet.\u201d The display tied up morning rush-hour traffic. **** I was in this traffic. They weren't helping GW they were making it worse. Traffic was backed up past Springfield on 95 and there were just cars sitting there running. GW protesters caused more harm than good during this protest. **** \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
