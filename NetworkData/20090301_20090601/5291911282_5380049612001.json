I have seen documentaries on tv, a terminal person had obtained the necessary drugs to end their life. They had an IV hooked to their arm, when they decided to do it, they injected the drug into the IV. After my first brain surgery, when I almost died, I wanted to end my life, because I couldn't see myself ever getting better. I was pretty screwed up! Would I do it now, knowing what I know? As a Christian, suicide is not an option, if I have a terminal illness and I'm in constant pain, it's possible. Would it be fair to my wife, our sons, thier wives and our gransdchildren? No it wouldn't, so I would choose to continue to live. However, if I was on life support and thats all that was keeping me alive, I would hope they turn the thing off!

Besides, some could say in watching the Jesus story, that he basically committed suicide in what he did... or that his father had him murdered... All kinds of ways at looking at bible stories. I, if I should be so lucky as to have the opportunity at the time, fully intend to pull my own plugs when all else seems pointless. Laws or no laws, bible or no bible. I'll be the judge of the most important part my life since birth. My death, how I will die.",

Too many machines that can be inserted into the body to keep it working.

We are keeping them alive when nature would decide otherwise. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. In those cases that it doesn't work, the people have went through so much it is unbelievable to those who don't see it on a regular basis. It puts the families through hell and back again. It drains them emotionally and financially. It is hell on them, but I will do it if the person or their families want it - that is for them to decide. It is their fate, not mine. This is why people NEED a living will and a durable medical power of attorney spelling out their wishes. If you don't have one, you will be kept alive, if possible, based on the wishes of your family (even if it isn't what you wanted) because there is no documentation. Also, on the flip side, without the living will to spell out that you want everything, including the kitchen sink, done to keep you alive, your family could potentially decide to pull the plug.

Then my family would not have the emotional roller coaster that goes along with it, and then you die anyway. And it would leave my familiy financially secure instead of strapped out. How many people would look forward to the possibility of being in a nursing home, because you cannot take care of yourself? Not just needing a little help. I am talking about not being able to do anything for yourself. Not being able to walk, turn over in bed by yourself, or even wipe your own behind. You have to be fed by a tube put into your stomach.

As a Christian, I am obligated to accept that God decides when we die, not us. But above that is our free will that He endowed us with. About six months ago my mom collapsed. Actually, she just stopped waking up. Alive, but with no spacial awareness except turning over and over from the pain. It was cancer, and we learned that it had invaded her entire body. There was nothing to be done, medically speaking. I grabbed the DVD player and her favorite movie and went to sit the night with her at Hospice. Next to her bed, listening to Ice Age play over and over again, it occurred to me that mom was already dead. She was breathing, but she was gone. In accordance with what my brother and I knew she wanted, we signed the DNR order so that she could die in peace, as pain free as they could make her. It was the hardest signature I've ever scribbled in my entire life. I pray to God I never have to again. But if it comes to that point, I will. Death is a very personal thing. It is also a very weird thing. For days mom slept. And then, one day, for no reason, she woke up. And she talked with us and laughed and, aside from the weakness, was... mom. And then she died the next day. It's like God gave her the opportunity to have a little bit of time to be aware that we were all there with her. Just a couple of hours - enough that she could see us, hear us, interact with us. And then He decided time was up. So I see this two ways. If mom had gone the way of assisted suicide, we would have missed that little example of God's love when He allowed her her goodbyes. Yes, she would have said her goodbyes. But it would have been missing that little, gentle brushing of God's hand. WE would have missed it. All of us - mom included. You may think it is silly, but every single one of us there at her bedside will tell you the same, exact thing: there was an angel holding her hand. Mom was at complete peace. She knew she was gone, and she was at peace with that. She wanted us to know that she was at peace with that so we could have peace, as well. And that angel stood patiently by, holding her hand, staying his duties to take her to heaven for a little while. She never talked to us about dying. She wanted to know how her cat was, to thank us for being there, to tell us that she loved us more than we could ever know. That was how she wanted to die. And this hardened Infantry soldier cried like a little girl losing her first puppy. I bawled. I didn't care who saw me. But I waited until she lapsed back into her unconscious state. I would enjoy my last moments with my mom smiling, just as she was, those last remembrance opportunities in joy for her life over the anguish that was her known and inevitable death. I'm blessed to not have missed that. At the same time, however, it was ultimately her choice. Hers alone. God gave her life and the free will to do with that life what she wanted. Who am I -- who are you -- to refuse her the decision to end her pain? Sometimes death is sudden and shocking. Sometimes death is wanted but elusive. But in any case, death is between God and the person. While it hurts to let go, it simply isn't up to us. If you'll pardon the adage, you have to love them enough to let them go. It is about personal freedom. Whether we agree with their choice or not is irrelevant. It is THEIR choice, the ultimate gift of love from an ultimate God: free will. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

There are times that people are only kept alive by massive dose of drugs that will keep their blood pressure, heart rate at livable ranges. Too many machines that can be inserted into the body to keep it working. Machines that go into the heart to aid in circulation (not just talking about pacemakers - those are kiddie toys in comparison). Without the drugs and machines they would definitely be dead. We are keeping them alive when nature would decide otherwise. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. In those cases that it doesn't work, the people have went through so much it is unbelievable to those who don't see it on a regular basis. It puts the families through hell and back again. It drains them emotionally and financially. It is hell on them, but I will do it if the person or their families want it - that is for them to decide. It is their fate, not mine. This is why people NEED a living will and a durable medical power of attorney spelling out their wishes. If you don't have one, you will be kept alive, if possible, based on the wishes of your family (even if it isn't what you wanted) because there is no documentation. Also, on the flip side, without the living will to spell out that you want everything, including the kitchen sink, done to keep you alive, your family could potentially decide to pull the plug. YOU NEED A LIVING WILL to tell people what you want done, when you can't speak for yourself! Based on this, my decision FOR ME, is that when it comes to a situation that it is no longer tenable for me to continue to exist, I WILL DECIDE MY FATE if need be. I don't plan on doing it just because I get ****ed off one day. This is thought out. I would rather it be over sooner, and less drawn out or painful if I have a terminal illness/disease. Then my family would not have the emotional roller coaster that goes along with it, and then you die anyway. And it would leave my familiy financially secure instead of strapped out. How many people would look forward to the possibility of being in a nursing home, because you cannot take care of yourself? Not just needing a little help. I am talking about not being able to do anything for yourself. Not being able to walk, turn over in bed by yourself, or even wipe your own behind. You have to be fed by a tube put into your stomach. Sorry not for me. Better to die with dignity and grace than be in that situation (for me). Sorry to be so long winded.",

        "content": "My religious values are, like my political values, constantly crossing the lines of what I am \"supposed\" to support. This is one of those times. As a Christian, I am obligated to accept that God decides when we die, not us. But above that is our free will that He endowed us with. About six months ago my mom collapsed. Actually, she just stopped waking up. Alive, but with no spacial awareness except turning over and over from the pain. It was cancer, and we learned that it had invaded her entire body. There was nothing to be done, medically speaking. I grabbed the DVD player and her favorite movie and went to sit the night with her at Hospice. Next to her bed, listening to Ice Age play over and over again, it occurred to me that mom was already dead. She was breathing, but she was gone. In accordance with what my brother and I knew she wanted, we signed the DNR order so that she could die in peace, as pain free as they could make her. It was the hardest signature I've ever scribbled in my entire life. I pray to God I never have to again. But if it comes to that point, I will. Death is a very personal thing. It is also a very weird thing. For days mom slept. And then, one day, for no reason, she woke up. And she talked with us and laughed and, aside from the weakness, was... mom. And then she died the next day. It's like God gave her the opportunity to have a little bit of time to be aware that we were all there with her. Just a couple of hours - enough that she could see us, hear us, interact with us. And then He decided time was up. So I see this two ways. If mom had gone the way of assisted suicide, we would have missed that little example of God's love when He allowed her her goodbyes. Yes, she would have said her goodbyes. But it would have been missing that little, gentle brushing of God's hand. WE would have missed it. All of us - mom included. You may think it is silly, but every single one of us there at her bedside will tell you the same, exact thing: there was an angel holding her hand. Mom was at complete peace. She knew she was gone, and she was at peace with that. She wanted us to know that she was at peace with that so we could have peace, as well. And that angel stood patiently by, holding her hand, staying his duties to take her to heaven for a little while. She never talked to us about dying. She wanted to know how her cat was, to thank us for being there, to tell us that she loved us more than we could ever know. That was how she wanted to die. And this hardened Infantry soldier cried like a little girl losing her first puppy. I bawled. I didn't care who saw me. But I waited until she lapsed back into her unconscious state. I would enjoy my last moments with my mom smiling, just as she was, those last remembrance opportunities in joy for her life over the anguish that was her known and inevitable death. I'm blessed to not have missed that. At the same time, however, it was ultimately her choice. Hers alone. God gave her life and the free will to do with that life what she wanted. Who am I -- who are you -- to refuse her the decision to end her pain? Sometimes death is sudden and shocking. Sometimes death is wanted but elusive. But in any case, death is between God and the person. While it hurts to let go, it simply isn't up to us. If you'll pardon the adage, you have to love them enough to let them go. It is about personal freedom. Whether we agree with their choice or not is irrelevant. It is THEIR choice, the ultimate gift of love from an ultimate God: free will. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
