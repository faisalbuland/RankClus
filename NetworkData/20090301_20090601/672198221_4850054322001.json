A spokeswoman for the company denied the allegation. ______________________________________ A California lawyer, Daniel Callahan, contacted by the contractors told The Associated Press that the U.S. Army had cleared the four men to leave Afghanistan on May 12 after completing their questioning in the shooting. But the men are now being held against their will by the company's executives in a company \"safe house\" in a Kabul mosque, he said. The men believe that Xe is attempting to negotiate a deal in which it would hand them over to Afghan authorities in exchange for official permission to remain in the country, Callahan said. The contracting company took the four away on Thursday from a military compound where they normally lived and they were never detained by the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Kubik said. \"What I can tell you is that they have been terminated and have been asked not to leave the country without the approval and direction of the (Department of Defense),\" Tyrrell told the Associated Press.",
