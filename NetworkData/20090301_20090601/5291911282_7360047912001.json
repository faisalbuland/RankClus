Needless to say, the cows stayed within that perimeter. And my friend's story: His great grandfather was fixing a church roof. Others with him said he should strap himself with a rope if he fell, to which he responded \"don't worry, I'll slow down at the end\". After some time, he did fall, but just stood up after hitting the ground. When questioned how he survived without getting hurt, he responded \"I told you I'd slow down at the end\". I hope these translate well enough.",

Elizabeth gave Sir Walter Raleigh the go-ahead to raid the Spanish Mane and put the Colony of Roanoke, and later Jamestown, into a place named \"Virginia\" after the Virgin Queen herself - - The rest is \"history\" - - Lady Elizabeth Howard, later Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire and Ormonde (c. 1480 \u2013 3 April 1538) was the eldest of the two daughters Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk had by his first wife Elizabeth Tilney. She was also a direct descendant of King Edward I.[1] She is most famous for having been the mother of Anne Boleyn, who became the second wife of King Henry VIII of England. As such, she was also the maternal grandmother of Queen Elizabeth I. The last name started out as a place name, Ormonde, in Ireland, which was given to some Duke named James Butler, the descendant of some Norman warrior-type, named James, who helped William the Conqueror fight his way across the the English Channel and conquer England in 1066. William was so pleased with James's good work, that he made James his body guard (Butler), so he became James (the) Butler. A later James Butler was sent to conquer and Ireland, which he mostly did, so he was given the area of Ormonde as fife, becoming James Butler, Duke of Ormonde. Ormonde included a place called Kilkenny, the home of the Kennedys. They often fought over the area but also inter-married. That is where Joseph Kennedy is from. Anyway, all of this, besides her beauty, is why Anne Boleyn's Protestant bloodline was certainly high enough that she could marry Henry VIII after he put aside Catherine of Argonne and broke from the Catholic Church - - Unfortunately, the Protestant/Catholic conflicts in Ireland mirror the Ormonde/Kennedy conflicts of old - - Oh, James Butler Hickco ck (Wild Bill) may also be a leaf from a very large family tree - - His mother was Polly Butler, daughter of a man named James Butler - - This message has been edited.

William was so pleased with James's good work, that he made James his body guard (Butler), so he became James (the) Butler. A later James Butler was sent to conquer and Ireland, which he mostly did, so he was given the area of Ormonde as fife, becoming James Butler, Duke of Ormonde. Ormonde included a place called Kilkenny, the home of the Kennedys. They often fought over the area but also inter-married. That is where Joseph Kennedy is from. Anyway, all of this, besides her beauty, is why Anne Boleyn's Protestant bloodline was certainly high enough that she could marry Henry VIII after he put aside Catherine of Argonne and broke from the Catholic Church - - Unfortunately, the Protestant/Catholic conflicts in Ireland mirror the Ormonde/Kennedy conflicts of old - - Oh, James Butler Hickco ck (Wild Bill) may also be a leaf from a very large family tree - - His mother was Polly Butler, daughter of a man named James Butler - - This message has been edited.

William was so pleased with James's good work, that he made James his body guard (Butler), so he became James (the) Butler.

Ormonde included a place called Kilkenny, the home of the Kennedys. They often fought over the area but also inter-married. That is where Joseph Kennedy is from. Anyway, all of this, besides her beauty, is why Anne Boleyn's Protestant bloodline was certainly high enough that she could marry Henry VIII after he put aside Catherine of Argonne and broke from the Catholic Church - - Unfortunately, the Protestant/Catholic conflicts in Ireland mirror the Ormonde/Kennedy conflicts of old - - Oh, James Butler Hickco ck (Wild Bill) may also be a leaf from a very large family tree - - His mother was Polly Butler, daughter of a man named James Butler - - This message has been edited.
