Clinton Foundation in an apparent quid pro quo deal that resulted in a pardon for Mr. Rich. The pardon was reviewed and blessed by Obama Attorney General and then Deputy AG Eric Holder, despite numerous requests by government officials to turn it down. $12,000,000: the amount of TARP money provided to community bank OneUnited despite the fact that it did not qualify for funds, and was \"under attack from its regulators for allegations of poor lending practices and executive-pay abuses.\" It turns out that Rep..
