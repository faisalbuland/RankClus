San Diego County and Imperial County (on the mexican border) in California... and one single city in Texas are the only known US cases. Again... this information has only arisen AFTER the Mexican Government sent CDC the sample for identification. Prior to that Mexico was thinking that they just had an outbreak of an existing flu type. But now that government is taking rather strict actions to limit its further spread... actions that the CDC thinks may be too late. As for the mortality rate... no one has died in the USA. Perhaps because we have better medical aid for the most part. In Mexico a little under 1100 cases have been identified so far since testing for the exact CDC confirmed virus began. Of taht at LEAST 62 deaths have already resulted. That is roughly 6% mortality rate... That is very high by US standards. Again it is not known exactly how many deats or infections there actually are in Mexico at this point. too much is never reported there. BTW: say 100 million Americans get exposed to this new virus... do you think a 5% or 6% mortality rate could be realistic? I am not certain myself. My fear is that Mexico is NOT ground zero for this virus strain. I am kind of worried that it originated in points south of Mexico where reporting is almost non-existant. And for a few more months I have loved ones down there... working it the area where viruses incubate and are easily transmitted. There is no cure or prevention for this swine flu bug.

The swine flu virus routinely causes outbreaks in pigs but doesn't usually kill many of them. Q Can people get swine flu? A Swine flu viruses don't usually infect humans. There have been occasional cases, usually among people who've had direct contact with infected pigs, such as farmworkers. Q Can it spread among humans? A There have been cases of the virus spreading from human to human, probably in the same way as seasonal flu, through coughing and sneezing by infected people. Q What are the symptoms of swine flu? A The symptoms are similar to those of regular flu -- fever, cough, fatigue, lack of appetite. Q Are there drugs to treat swine flu in humans? A Four different drugs are approved in the U.S. to treat the flu, but the new virus has shown resistance to the two oldest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. Q Does a regular flu shot protect against swine flu? A The seasonal flu vaccine used in the U.S. this year is not likely to protect against the latest swine flu virus. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Again it is not known exactly how many deats or infections there actually are in Mexico at this point. too much is never reported there. BTW: say 100 million Americans get exposed to this new virus... do you think a 5% or 6% mortality rate could be realistic? I am not certain myself. My fear is that Mexico is NOT ground zero for this virus strain. I am kind of worried that it originated in points south of Mexico where reporting is almost non-existant.

The swine flu virus routinely causes outbreaks in pigs but doesn't usually kill many of them. Q Can people get swine flu? A Swine flu viruses don't usually infect humans. There have been occasional cases, usually among people who've had direct contact with infected pigs, such as farmworkers. Q Can it spread among humans? A There have been cases of the virus spreading from human to human, probably in the same way as seasonal flu, through coughing and sneezing by infected people. Q What are the symptoms of swine flu? A The symptoms are similar to those of regular flu -- fever, cough, fatigue, lack of appetite. Q Are there drugs to treat swine flu in humans? A Four different drugs are approved in the U.S. to treat the flu, but the new virus has shown resistance to the two oldest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. Q Does a regular flu shot protect against swine flu? A The seasonal flu vaccine used in the U.S. this year is not likely to protect against the latest swine flu virus. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Perhaps because we have better medical aid for the most part. In Mexico a little under 1100 cases have been identified so far since testing for the exact CDC confirmed virus began. Of taht at LEAST 62 deaths have already resulted. That is roughly 6% mortality rate... That is very high by US standards. Again it is not known exactly how many deats or infections there actually are in Mexico at this point. too much is never reported there. BTW: say 100 million Americans get exposed to this new virus... do you think a 5% or 6% mortality rate could be realistic? I am not certain myself. My fear is that Mexico is NOT ground zero for this virus strain. I am kind of worried that it originated in points south of Mexico where reporting is almost non-existant.

The swine flu virus routinely causes outbreaks in pigs but doesn't usually kill many of them. Q Can people get swine flu? A Swine flu viruses don't usually infect humans. There have been occasional cases, usually among people who've had direct contact with infected pigs, such as farmworkers. Q Can it spread among humans? A There have been cases of the virus spreading from human to human, probably in the same way as seasonal flu, through coughing and sneezing by infected people. Q What are the symptoms of swine flu? A The symptoms are similar to those of regular flu -- fever, cough, fatigue, lack of appetite. Q Are there drugs to treat swine flu in humans? A Four different drugs are approved in the U.S. to treat the flu, but the new virus has shown resistance to the two oldest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. Q Does a regular flu shot protect against swine flu? A The seasonal flu vaccine used in the U.S. this year is not likely to protect against the latest swine flu virus. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Again it is not known exactly how many deats or infections there actually are in Mexico at this point. too much is never reported there. BTW: say 100 million Americans get exposed to this new virus... do you think a 5% or 6% mortality rate could be realistic? I am not certain myself. My fear is that Mexico is NOT ground zero for this virus strain. I am kind of worried that it originated in points south of Mexico where reporting is almost non-existant. And for a few more months I have loved ones down there... working it the area where viruses incubate and are easily transmitted. There is no cure or prevention for this swine flu bug. All one can do is ride it out. Not the best answer for a warm and fuzzy feeling.",

The swine flu virus routinely causes outbreaks in pigs but doesn't usually kill many of them. Q Can people get swine flu? A Swine flu viruses don't usually infect humans. There have been occasional cases, usually among people who've had direct contact with infected pigs, such as farmworkers. Q Can it spread among humans? A There have been cases of the virus spreading from human to human, probably in the same way as seasonal flu, through coughing and sneezing by infected people. Q What are the symptoms of swine flu? A The symptoms are similar to those of regular flu -- fever, cough, fatigue, lack of appetite. Q Are there drugs to treat swine flu in humans? A Four different drugs are approved in the U.S. to treat the flu, but the new virus has shown resistance to the two oldest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. Q Does a regular flu shot protect against swine flu? A The seasonal flu vaccine used in the U.S. this year is not likely to protect against the latest swine flu virus. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
