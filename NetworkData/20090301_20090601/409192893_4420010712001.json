'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19663.html' The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president\u2019s prepared remarks follow him wherever he speaks. Resting on top of a tall, narrow pole, they flank his podium during speeches in the White House\u2019s stately parlors. They stood next to him on the floor of a manufacturing plant in Indiana as he pitched his economic stimulus plan. They traveled to the Department of Transportation this week and were in the Capitol Rotunda last month when he paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln in six-minute prepared remarks. Obama\u2019s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual \u2013 not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events large and small. After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no luck. His use of the teleprompter makes work tricky for the television crews and photographers trying to capture an image of the president announcing a new Cabinet secretary or housing plan without a pane of glass blocking his face. And it is a startling sight to see such sleek, modern technology set against the mahogany doors and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the East Room or the marble columns of Grand Foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s just something presidents haven\u2019t done,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential historian who has held court in the White House since December of 1975. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to the eye. In a way it stands in the middle between the audience and the president because his eye is on the teleprompter.\u201d Just how much of a crutch the teleprompter has become for Obama was on sharp display during his latest commerce secretary announcement. The president spoke from a teleprompter in the ornate Indian Treaty Room for a few minutes. Then Gov. Gary Locke stepped to the podium and pulled out a piece of paper for reference. The president\u2019s teleprompter also elicited some uncomfortable laughter after he announced Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as his choice for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cKathy,\u201d Obama said, turning the podium over to Sebelius, who waited at the microphone for an awkward few seconds while the teleprompters were lowered to the floor and the television cameras rolled. Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it. Before Obama entered a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday to announce his crackdown on defense contracts, a CNN reporter asked an Obama aide if the teleprompter could be moved further away from the podium or lowered. The answer was an unequivocal \u2018no.\u2019 \u201cHe uses them to death,\u201d a television crewmember who also covered the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush said of the teleprompter. \u201cThe problem is, he never looks at you. He\u2019s looking left, right, left, right \u2014 not at the camera. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s not making eye contact with the American people.\u201d",

'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19663.html' The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president\u2019s prepared remarks follow him wherever he speaks. Resting on top of a tall, narrow pole, they flank his podium during speeches in the White House\u2019s stately parlors. They stood next to him on the floor of a manufacturing plant in Indiana as he pitched his economic stimulus plan. They traveled to the Department of Transportation this week and were in the Capitol Rotunda last month when he paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln in six-minute prepared remarks. Obama\u2019s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual \u2013 not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events large and small. After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no luck. His use of the teleprompter makes work tricky for the television crews and photographers trying to capture an image of the president announcing a new Cabinet secretary or housing plan without a pane of glass blocking his face. And it is a startling sight to see such sleek, modern technology set against the mahogany doors and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the East Room or the marble columns of Grand Foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s just something presidents haven\u2019t done,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential historian who has held court in the White House since December of 1975. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to the eye. In a way it stands in the middle between the audience and the president because his eye is on the teleprompter.\u201d Just how much of a crutch the teleprompter has become for Obama was on sharp display during his latest commerce secretary announcement. The president spoke from a teleprompter in the ornate Indian Treaty Room for a few minutes. Then Gov. Gary Locke stepped to the podium and pulled out a piece of paper for reference. The president\u2019s teleprompter also elicited some uncomfortable laughter after he announced Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as his choice for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cKathy,\u201d Obama said, turning the podium over to Sebelius, who waited at the microphone for an awkward few seconds while the teleprompters were lowered to the floor and the television cameras rolled. Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it. Before Obama entered a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday to announce his crackdown on defense contracts, a CNN reporter asked an Obama aide if the teleprompter could be moved further away from the podium or lowered.

Bush said of the teleprompter. \u201cThe problem is, he never looks at you. He\u2019s looking left, right, left, right \u2014 not at the camera. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s not making eye contact with the American people.\u201d",

        "content": "Who was that saying he didnt use a teleprompter in the pseudo State of th Union Address? President Barack Obama doesn\u2019t go anywhere without his TelePrompter. 'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19663.html' The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president\u2019s prepared remarks follow him wherever he speaks. Resting on top of a tall, narrow pole, they flank his podium during speeches in the White House\u2019s stately parlors. They stood next to him on the floor of a manufacturing plant in Indiana as he pitched his economic stimulus plan. They traveled to the Department of Transportation this week and were in the Capitol Rotunda last month when he paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln in six-minute prepared remarks. Obama\u2019s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual \u2013 not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events large and small. After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no luck. His use of the teleprompter makes work tricky for the television crews and photographers trying to capture an image of the president announcing a new Cabinet secretary or housing plan without a pane of glass blocking his face. And it is a startling sight to see such sleek, modern technology set against the mahogany doors and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the East Room or the marble columns of Grand Foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s just something presidents haven\u2019t done,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential historian who has held court in the White House since December of 1975. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to the eye. In a way it stands in the middle between the audience and the president because his eye is on the teleprompter.\u201d Just how much of a crutch the teleprompter has become for Obama was on sharp display during his latest commerce secretary announcement. The president spoke from a teleprompter in the ornate Indian Treaty Room for a few minutes. Then Gov. Gary Locke stepped to the podium and pulled out a piece of paper for reference. The president\u2019s teleprompter also elicited some uncomfortable laughter after he announced Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as his choice for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cKathy,\u201d Obama said, turning the podium over to Sebelius, who waited at the microphone for an awkward few seconds while the teleprompters were lowered to the floor and the television cameras rolled. Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it. Before Obama entered a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday to announce his crackdown on defense contracts, a CNN reporter asked an Obama aide if the teleprompter could be moved further away from the podium or lowered. The answer was an unequivocal \u2018no.\u2019 \u201cHe uses them to death,\u201d a television crewmember who also covered the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush said of the teleprompter. \u201cThe problem is, he never looks at you. He\u2019s looking left, right, left, right \u2014 not at the camera. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s not making eye contact with the American people.\u201d",

Obama\u2019s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual \u2013 not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events large and small. After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no luck. His use of the teleprompter makes work tricky for the television crews and photographers trying to capture an image of the president announcing a new Cabinet secretary or housing plan without a pane of glass blocking his face. And it is a startling sight to see such sleek, modern technology set against the mahogany doors and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the East Room or the marble columns of Grand Foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s just something presidents haven\u2019t done,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential historian who has held court in the White House since December of 1975. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to the eye. In a way it stands in the middle between the audience and the president because his eye is on the teleprompter.\u201d Just how much of a crutch the teleprompter has become for Obama was on sharp display during his latest commerce secretary announcement. The president spoke from a teleprompter in the ornate Indian Treaty Room for a few minutes. Then Gov. Gary Locke stepped to the podium and pulled out a piece of paper for reference. The president\u2019s teleprompter also elicited some uncomfortable laughter after he announced Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as his choice for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cKathy,\u201d Obama said, turning the podium over to Sebelius, who waited at the microphone for an awkward few seconds while the teleprompters were lowered to the floor and the television cameras rolled. Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it. Before Obama entered a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday to announce his crackdown on defense contracts, a CNN reporter asked an Obama aide if the teleprompter could be moved further away from the podium or lowered. The answer was an unequivocal \u2018no.\u2019 \u201cHe uses them to death,\u201d a television crewmember who also covered the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush said of the teleprompter. \u201cThe problem is, he never looks at you. He\u2019s looking left, right, left, right \u2014 not at the camera.

'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19663.html' The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president\u2019s prepared remarks follow him wherever he speaks. Resting on top of a tall, narrow pole, they flank his podium during speeches in the White House\u2019s stately parlors. They stood next to him on the floor of a manufacturing plant in Indiana as he pitched his economic stimulus plan. They traveled to the Department of Transportation this week and were in the Capitol Rotunda last month when he paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln in six-minute prepared remarks. Obama\u2019s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual \u2013 not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events large and small. After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no luck. His use of the teleprompter makes work tricky for the television crews and photographers trying to capture an image of the president announcing a new Cabinet secretary or housing plan without a pane of glass blocking his face. And it is a startling sight to see such sleek, modern technology set against the mahogany doors and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the East Room or the marble columns of Grand Foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s just something presidents haven\u2019t done,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential historian who has held court in the White House since December of 1975. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to the eye. In a way it stands in the middle between the audience and the president because his eye is on the teleprompter.\u201d Just how much of a crutch the teleprompter has become for Obama was on sharp display during his latest commerce secretary announcement. The president spoke from a teleprompter in the ornate Indian Treaty Room for a few minutes. Then Gov. Gary Locke stepped to the podium and pulled out a piece of paper for reference. The president\u2019s teleprompter also elicited some uncomfortable laughter after he announced Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as his choice for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cKathy,\u201d Obama said, turning the podium over to Sebelius, who waited at the microphone for an awkward few seconds while the teleprompters were lowered to the floor and the television cameras rolled. Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it. Before Obama entered a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday to announce his crackdown on defense contracts, a CNN reporter asked an Obama aide if the teleprompter could be moved further away from the podium or lowered. The answer was an unequivocal \u2018no.\u2019 \u201cHe uses them to death,\u201d a television crewmember who also covered the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W.

'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19663.html' The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president\u2019s prepared remarks follow him wherever he speaks. Resting on top of a tall, narrow pole, they flank his podium during speeches in the White House\u2019s stately parlors. They stood next to him on the floor of a manufacturing plant in Indiana as he pitched his economic stimulus plan. They traveled to the Department of Transportation this week and were in the Capitol Rotunda last month when he paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln in six-minute prepared remarks. Obama\u2019s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual \u2013 not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events large and small. After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no luck. His use of the teleprompter makes work tricky for the television crews and photographers trying to capture an image of the president announcing a new Cabinet secretary or housing plan without a pane of glass blocking his face. And it is a startling sight to see such sleek, modern technology set against the mahogany doors and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the East Room or the marble columns of Grand Foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s just something presidents haven\u2019t done,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential historian who has held court in the White House since December of 1975. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to the eye. In a way it stands in the middle between the audience and the president because his eye is on the teleprompter.\u201d Just how much of a crutch the teleprompter has become for Obama was on sharp display during his latest commerce secretary announcement. The president spoke from a teleprompter in the ornate Indian Treaty Room for a few minutes. Then Gov. Gary Locke stepped to the podium and pulled out a piece of paper for reference. The president\u2019s teleprompter also elicited some uncomfortable laughter after he announced Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as his choice for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cKathy,\u201d Obama said, turning the podium over to Sebelius, who waited at the microphone for an awkward few seconds while the teleprompters were lowered to the floor and the television cameras rolled. Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it. Before Obama entered a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday to announce his crackdown on defense contracts, a CNN reporter asked an Obama aide if the teleprompter could be moved further away from the podium or lowered. The answer was an unequivocal \u2018no.\u2019 \u201cHe uses them to death,\u201d a television crewmember who also covered the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush said of the teleprompter. \u201cThe problem is, he never looks at you. He\u2019s looking left, right, left, right \u2014 not at the camera.

Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it.

'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19663.html' The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president\u2019s prepared remarks follow him wherever he speaks. Resting on top of a tall, narrow pole, they flank his podium during speeches in the White House\u2019s stately parlors. They stood next to him on the floor of a manufacturing plant in Indiana as he pitched his economic stimulus plan. They traveled to the Department of Transportation this week and were in the Capitol Rotunda last month when he paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln in six-minute prepared remarks. Obama\u2019s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual \u2013 not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events large and small. After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no luck. His use of the teleprompter makes work tricky for the television crews and photographers trying to capture an image of the president announcing a new Cabinet secretary or housing plan without a pane of glass blocking his face. And it is a startling sight to see such sleek, modern technology set against the mahogany doors and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the East Room or the marble columns of Grand Foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s just something presidents haven\u2019t done,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential historian who has held court in the White House since December of 1975. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to the eye. In a way it stands in the middle between the audience and the president because his eye is on the teleprompter.\u201d Just how much of a crutch the teleprompter has become for Obama was on sharp display during his latest commerce secretary announcement. The president spoke from a teleprompter in the ornate Indian Treaty Room for a few minutes. Then Gov. Gary Locke stepped to the podium and pulled out a piece of paper for reference. The president\u2019s teleprompter also elicited some uncomfortable laughter after he announced Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as his choice for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cKathy,\u201d Obama said, turning the podium over to Sebelius, who waited at the microphone for an awkward few seconds while the teleprompters were lowered to the floor and the television cameras rolled. Obama has relied on a teleprompter through even the shortest announcements and when repeating the same lines on his economic stimulus plan that he's been saying for months \u2013 whereas past presidents have mostly worked off of notes on the podium except during major speeches, such as the State of the Union. In a break from his routine, Obama did not use a teleprompter during his pre-Inauguration speech at a factory in Bedford Heights, Ohio \u2014 and his delivery seemed to suffer. He paused too long at parts. He accentuated the wrong words. And overall he sounded hesitant and halting as he spoke from the prepared remarks on the podium. As president, the stakes in what he says are higher. Governing is not campaigning, and, as a former first-term senator, Obama has not held a previous elected position where his words carried even close to this level of influence. \u201cIn this kind of environment, you don\u2019t want to make mistakes \u2014 on the economy you\u2019re talking about doing things that affect the markets,\u201d Kumar said. But be it extra precaution, style or a mental crutch, Obama has shown in the past that he needs the teleprompter. And while he still has his prepared remarks placed on the podium in a leather folder, the White House has shown no sign of trying to wean him off of it. Before Obama entered a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday to announce his crackdown on defense contracts, a CNN reporter asked an Obama aide if the teleprompter could be moved further away from the podium or lowered. The answer was an unequivocal \u2018no.\u2019 \u201cHe uses them to death,\u201d a television crewmember who also covered the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush said of the teleprompter. \u201cThe problem is, he never looks at you. He\u2019s looking left, right, left, right \u2014 not at the camera. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s not making eye contact with the American people.\u201d",

BTW: Platform instructors (H identifier) always have their notes on the podeum... even to teach about a pen.... LOL",
