But I've been having doubts as to whether or not I should continue to serve. Here's the scenario as briefly as I can state it: I joined, like most of us, out of a love of our country and our Constitution. I take the whole \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America\" very seriously. One of the things I admire about our Constitution and the legal system that arises from it is the involuntary universality of its rights and restrictions. Boumediene v. Bush found that enemy combatants have the same rights to trial in the federal court system and habeas corpus as the President, and Hamdan v. Rumsfeld found that the President has no more power to circumvent the law as an enemy combatant. I treasure that equality and fairness granted by the Constitution. I am, however, starting to feel like I am in the vast, vast minority. Two consecutive Executive offices have tried to violate both of these rulings and no one seems to care that much. Is there a point to supporting and defending the Constitution if no one else is willing? Or is it moot because I'm just imagining that I'm the only one who is concerned? (just to cut off some ad hominem attacks: I'm actually a Republican, and if I ever agree with the ACLU it's only because they're accidentally right)",
