Need some refinement I guess on my part. \"http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2002/pdf/may.pdf\" I took it that you meant that a private run corp was not as efficient as producing energy as publically owned power companies. The cost to produce vs output volume been repeatedly proven to be more efficient when privately owned. Not ALWAYS but the majority of the time. I will agree that de-regulation half arsed will drive up costs to the consumer short term and if not completely deregulated then long term as well. So that is what I thought you meant by cheaper and more efficient. When it comes to distribution, the privately owned companies running power transmission lines are more efficient when fabrication or maintenance is concerned. When it comes to the size of need, generally the largest areas in megawatt consumption are better served by the private companies than the public when comparing costs per kilowatt due to the efficiency. If you meant what I pay per month de-regulation vs regulated I agree\u2026 It is cheaper when regulated although it has been argued (aside from allowing super conglomerates of power companies to be formed like AT &T of old) that complete de-regulation nation wide would allow Florida cities to pick and choose buying power from New Mexico or Vermont instead of much closer to home.

So that is what I thought you meant by cheaper and more efficient. When it comes to distribution, the privately owned companies running power transmission lines are more efficient when fabrication or maintenance is concerned. When it comes to the size of need, generally the largest areas in megawatt consumption are better served by the private companies than the public when comparing costs per kilowatt due to the efficiency. If you meant what I pay per month de-regulation vs regulated I agree\u2026 It is cheaper when regulated although it has been argued (aside from allowing super conglomerates of power companies to be formed like AT &T of old) that complete de-regulation nation wide would allow Florida cities to pick and choose buying power from New Mexico or Vermont instead of much closer to home. (Not talking peak power) The PDF you link to, includes such corrupt and backwards owners as the former Soviet Union, who couldn't even keep one of their plants from turning into a mass of slag. The ten cheapest sources of power in the United States are publicly owned. SOme of them run Nuclear power plants. But nuclear power only accounts for 12 percent of electricity. Now, if you want to compare a corrupt pulicly owned power plant with an honest privately owned plant - If those were your criterium, you could make your point. But here in the US corruption seems to be a monopoly of private interests - So while California endured rolling blackouts because of Enron, San Francisco enjoyed cheap and regular electricity from it's publicly owned power plants. Since you admit that deregulation poorly handled doesn't work out to well, I wont rub in the fact that here in New York, our rates have skyrocketed since deregulation, and recent reports have demonstrated that this is due to corruption.

Just because they're town or city government instead of state doesn't mean they're not gov't. Silly ;-) (And merging them likely will CUT costs and labor to run them more efficiently.... hard to argue that's big gov't)",

Could you elucidate on your objections? Care to challenge my statement? Dave Maybe I did not understand your comment as much as I thought I did. Need some refinement I guess on my part. \"http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2002/pdf/may.pdf\" I took it that you meant that a private run corp was not as efficient as producing energy as publically owned power companies. The cost to produce vs output volume been repeatedly proven to be more efficient when privately owned. Not ALWAYS but the majority of the time. I will agree that de-regulation half arsed will drive up costs to the consumer short term and if not completely deregulated then long term as well. So that is what I thought you meant by cheaper and more efficient. When it comes to distribution, the privately owned companies running power transmission lines are more efficient when fabrication or maintenance is concerned. When it comes to the size of need, generally the largest areas in megawatt consumption are better served by the private companies than the public when comparing costs per kilowatt due to the efficiency. If you meant what I pay per month de-regulation vs regulated I agree\u2026 It is cheaper when regulated although it has been argued (aside from allowing super conglomerates of power companies to be formed like AT &T of old) that complete de-regulation nation wide would allow Florida cities to pick and choose buying power from New Mexico or Vermont instead of much closer to home. (Not talking peak power) The PDF you link to, includes such corrupt and backwards owners as the former Soviet Union, who couldn't even keep one of their plants from turning into a mass of slag. The ten cheapest sources of power in the United States are publicly owned. SOme of them run Nuclear power plants. But nuclear power only accounts for 12 percent of electricity. Now, if you want to compare a corrupt pulicly owned power plant with an honest privately owned plant - If those were your criterium, you could make your point. But here in the US corruption seems to be a monopoly of private interests - So while California endured rolling blackouts because of Enron, San Francisco enjoyed cheap and regular electricity from it's publicly owned power plants. Since you admit that deregulation poorly handled doesn't work out to well, I wont rub in the fact that here in New York, our rates have skyrocketed since deregulation, and recent reports have demonstrated that this is due to corruption.
