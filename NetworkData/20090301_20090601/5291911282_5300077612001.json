The rumor, in various versions, claimed Clinton brought with her last month to Beijing a written agreement offering to extend to China the option to exercise eminent domain rights within the U.S. The rights purportedly were offered as collateral for China's continued willingness to purchase additional trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasury debt the Obama administration hopes to sell to finance projected federal budget deficits. \"There is no factual basis or substance to this report,\" Laura Tischler, a State Department press officer, e-mailed WND in response to an inquiry. the U.S. Treasury is planning to raise $2.5 trillion in debt in 2009 and an additional $4 trillion in 2010 to provide financing for the projected Obama administration deficits. The massive amount of U.S. Treasury debt financing is projected to increase the current $10 trillion national debt by 65 percent in just the first two years of the Obama administration. Underlying the Internet rumor was the fact that a major purpose of Clinton's February trip to China was to make sure the Chinese would continue to buy U.S. Treasury debt in the trillions of dollars the Obama administration will need to fund the massive budgetary deficits planned for economic bailouts and an unprecedented expansion of the welfare state. China and Japan are the two largest holders of U.S. Treasury debt, with China currently owning some $800 billion in Treasury debt securities. China wanted guarantees -- what DID they get?",

We ship all our money to China to buy up their slave-labor produced goods; and they in turn BUY NOTHING from us! That has given them huge leverage against this country. To get any of that money, we have to hand over the keys. Hope it is only homes, and not the keys to the White House!! This echoes back in the 70s and 80s when the Japanese started buying up everything across the country as Electronics dies in America and shifted to Japan via Sony etc.. Soon the Chinese will have all the property... Who's got all the jobs? You??? Wandering and Wondering",

China, will do just about anything she wants to, as we, the USA Electorate don't have a clue about foreign policy. Note the following: 1.Indeed it is happening again at both the north and south ends of the continent! Just last week when President Obama was visiting in Ottawa it was announced that Russian \u201cBear\u201d bombers were skirting the north edge of Canadian arctic airspace -as they did for 30 or so years on our east and west coasts during the \u201cCold War\u201d. They were, of course, met by Canadian F18s, as they would have been by American F15s had they been in or near Alaskan airspace. They are really no problem or immediate threat -except that they demonstrate that Russia is \u201cat it again.\u201d 2. Venezuala Chavez continues to cosy up to Iran's dictator, allowing the opportunity for his rants to be public in his country. 3. Chavez recently courted Putin's Naval fleet, allowed a visit of the Russian Long Range Bear fleet, and has on hand NOW, a small contintgent of Sukolov 30 Fighters. China, Cuba, Venezuala, South American socialist countries. Can anyone see a pattern? Very similar to the old Wars of Liberation prelims. Folks, we asked for this OBNA in November. If your' not concerned now, then forget the future. Regardless, the Cotton will get planted. Semper FI end",
