If you will recall, last month we had an intruder in our home. He did not cause any problems, the Sheriff was here in 5 minutes, they looked for him, but did not find him. A week ago Thursday, a woman sideswiped our car in the Wal Mart parking lot. Lora had got behind the steering a second or two before the woman hit our car. If she had been a second or two earlier...she would have seriously injured or killed Lora. State Patrol and city police were there in less than 10 minutes. The Fire Department, EMTs were there just behind the cops. The lady who struck our car had some medical emergency, EMTs assisted her. Keep smiling, everyone will wonder what you've been up to!",

Of course I'd go easy on any combat veterans I'd catch speeding. It doesn't work that way. Everyone's supposed to be equal under the law. One of the biggest problems here in Fayetteville/Cumberland County, NC is that almost everyone knows, \"someone.\" The cop writes the ticket and an hour later it's gone like a fart in the breeze. The cops lose their pride in their work and between that and the low pay, move on. The only people that they can find to work law enforcement are all too often those that wouldn't be hired elsewhere. Just last week a state representative was pulled over for speeding (110Mph.) and had alcohol on his breath. He was let off with a verbal warning. The only reason he was finally ticketed was that he was too stupid to keep his mouth shut and stay under the radar. He got to the state house still smelling of alcohol, Hugged and kissed a page, I think it was, and when chastised for his actions, told his colleges that if they didn't like it they could go to hell. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",

If you will recall, last month we had an intruder in our home. He did not cause any problems, the Sheriff was here in 5 minutes, they looked for him, but did not find him. A week ago Thursday, a woman sideswiped our car in the Wal Mart parking lot. Lora had got behind the steering a second or two before the woman hit our car. If she had been a second or two earlier...she would have seriously injured or killed Lora. State Patrol and city police were there in less than 10 minutes. The Fire Department, EMTs were there just behind the cops. The lady who struck our car had some medical emergency, EMTs assisted her. Keep smiling, everyone will wonder what you've been up to!",

One of the biggest problems here in Fayetteville/Cumberland County, NC is that almost everyone knows, \"someone.\" The cop writes the ticket and an hour later it's gone like a fart in the breeze.

Just last week a state representative was pulled over for speeding (110Mph.) and had alcohol on his breath. He was let off with a verbal warning. The only reason he was finally ticketed was that he was too stupid to keep his mouth shut and stay under the radar. He got to the state house still smelling of alcohol, Hugged and kissed a page, I think it was, and when chastised for his actions, told his colleges that if they didn't like it they could go to hell.
