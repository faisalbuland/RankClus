Without regard to the merits of a 5% pay cut for state employees earning over $100,000, I would simply point out that teacher salaries in Florida are established by individual schools and school districts so I question whether the cut would apply to them at all. If it does, in a lousy job market, it is unlikely that very many employees would quit, teachers or otherwise.

Without regard to the merits of a 5% pay cut for state employees earning over $100,000, I would simply point out that teacher salaries in Florida are established by individual schools and school districts so I question whether the cut would apply to them at all. If it does, in a lousy job market, it is unlikely that very many employees would quit, teachers or otherwise. Regardless, with the average teacher salary in Florida well below $50,000 (specifically $46,922 for the 07-08 school year), I doubt there would be a substantive impact in that arena anyway.

It does not have to stop at the 100k and over level either. Each and every job needs to be looked at. Good going Florida! Great example to set! The situation in Florida will have absolutely no impact on you, so before you go off leading the cheers, think about this. The article you cite mentions only the legal community specifically. It mentions that that the Judges that are over paid (and I agree) will then migrate to ambulance chaser's where they can earn more money. Then what happens? While I agree the legal system is screwed up, it's not just at the judge level--it's through out. However, you fail to mention further that the budget shortfall down here will have a greater impact and it's in teacher salary's and quite possibly jobs being cut or vacancies not being filled. Looking down the road, if education fails due to the lack of qualified teacher's, the next generation of voters will be educated how? We'll have another generation of voters that will align to another mesiah like they did last November? Good going Florida? What a great example to set? Would you like that to happen in Virginia too? Without regard to the merits of a 5% pay cut for state employees earning over $100,000, I would simply point out that teacher salaries in Florida are established by individual schools and school districts so I question whether the cut would apply to them at all. If it does, in a lousy job market, it is unlikely that very many employees would quit, teachers or otherwise. Regardless, with the average teacher salary in Florida well below $50,000 (specifically $46,922 for the 07-08 school year), I doubt there would be a substantive impact in that arena anyway. I never said teachers would quit. I aid they would be cut or vacancies not filled. Fair enough. I interpreted it to be an argument against the 5% cut ... my bad.",

This is what ALL governments at all levels need to be looking at. Cutting the over paid beurocrats checks. I hope the rest of the states follow.
