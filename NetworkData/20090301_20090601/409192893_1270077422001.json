According to an outline the company has been sharing privately with Washington legislators, the number of cars that GM sells in the United States and builds in Mexico, China and South Korea will roughly double.

One thing I am reminded of - when our Founding Fathers started this country, they put in place a set of tariffs that helped American business and industry grow (by helping make their goods comparably priced to imports) while still keeping imported goods readily available should they be wanted. They also limited the scope of Corporations - having seen from British society what harm they could do if left unrestricted.

MD - the factory I work at just shed over 375 jobs in the past 6 weeks over this mess - over 1/3rd of our workforce, and this is less than 6 months after our community gave them a $15 million dollar tax abatement (for the sole reason that they were the county's largest employer).

Until that ends, I don't see any American business succeeding in the near future. One thing I am reminded of - when our Founding Fathers started this country, they put in place a set of tariffs that helped American business and industry grow (by helping make their goods comparably priced to imports) while still keeping imported goods readily available should they be wanted. They also limited the scope of Corporations - having seen from British society what harm they could do if left unrestricted. One of the key ways this was done was by not giving them the same rights as a human being - because they knew that Corporations were formed to share the wealth but not the responsibility/accountability should the corporation break the law. This was changed with Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad - the landmark 1886 Supreme Court case that changed 100+ years of our Founding Father's intentions by giving the same rights to a corporation that you and I enjoy as human beings. The \"Free Trade\" movement is a farce pushed on our country by a small group of wealthy elites whose only motivation is greed - and it flies against everything that our Founding Fathers put in place when they were building our nation and democracy.",

According to an outline the company has been sharing privately with Washington legislators, the number of cars that GM sells in the United States and builds in Mexico, China and South Korea will roughly double. The proportion of GM cars sold domestically and manufactured in those low-wage countries will rise from 15 percent to 23 percent over the next five years, according to the figures contained in a 12-page presentation offered to lawmakers in response to their questions about overseas production. As a result, the long-simmering argument over U.S. manufacturers expanding production overseas -- normally arising between unions and private companies -- is about to engage the Obama administration Read the story at the link.

According to an outline the company has been sharing privately with Washington legislators, the number of cars that GM sells in the United States and builds in Mexico, China and South Korea will roughly double. The proportion of GM cars sold domestically and manufactured in those low-wage countries will rise from 15 percent to 23 percent over the next five years, according to the figures contained in a 12-page presentation offered to lawmakers in response to their questions about overseas production. As a result, the long-simmering argument over U.S. manufacturers expanding production overseas -- normally arising between unions and private companies -- is about to engage the Obama administration Read the story at the link.

Until we do away with the free trade agreements and restore the tariff system, this will keep happening as corporations are obligated to do whatever it takes to make more profit for the stockholders no matter what harm it causes to the country.",
