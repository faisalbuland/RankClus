They (those with the mission zeal) are deliberately putting their religion above the law and that is wrong, according to St. Paul and other Christian writers. So why defend it?

Amazing! Ixcatzin They have been doing it for 2,000 years (deceiving converts into 'getting saved') starting with the Jews at the time of Jesus, so what makes you think they'll quit now? And as usually, it will jeopardize the lives of those who do convert and they will then become targets of the Taliban and probably killed. But then, they are 'saved' aren't they, so no problem there! And they will compete with each other to do it to, get get the 'heathens' saved the \"right way\". Is the idea if they convert them over there, that they will take up arms and fight for us? It's the Crusades, a Christian 'holy war' of sorts. soscorpio, you lack appreciation for diplomatic rules the military has to follow. Does not your own book say to 'obey those who have rule over you' so how can you support this defiance against the authorized authority? I hope someone get's held in account for this blatant interference with the law/policy. It sets a bad example. RT, I know they will not stop. But it is important for them to understand that their defiance shows how little they follow their own doctrine, not to mention the law of the Country they represent. Sad! What surprises me is that they are so prepared to casually approach Muslims; I mean they even have their NT conveniently translated and all. Ixcatl",

        "quote": "Originally posted by 16951692: Every day I pray for the peace of Jerusalem and take seriously G-d's promise to bless those who bless Israel. I don't know exactly why G-d said this and do not defend the actions of G-d's people, whose souls I love as, with G-d's help, I do yours. We really are blessed...life, health, home, family etc...but realize G-d could take as He has given. Well, here's one last thought: G-d loves to bless and only asks we remember to say, \"Thank you.\" So, just in case my neighbors and friends forget to thank Him, I try to remember to say, \"Thank you!\" for my neighbor's blessings. Do I want to know what Ixcatl means?", 
        "reply": " 16951692, Ixcatl means cotton, it is a Nahuatl word. By adding the ending zin, the word becomes a proper name. Ixcatzin was the name I chose when I was learning Nahutal, since my name (Raquel) means ewe. Amerindians did not own any sheep, so I chose cotton. See ya after Shabbat. Raquel",
