        "content": "\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=7254270&page=1\" Homeowners watching the value of their houses slowly ebb are storming tax offices from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Atlanta, demanding that county officials reassess their homes and lower their property taxes. Boxes are tossed into a pile mimicking the Boston Tea Party revolt during an anti-tax rally organized by Property Owners for Predictable Tax Now on the steps of the Washington State Capitol building in Olympia, Wash., Monday, Jan. 14, 2008. (John Froschauer/AP Photo)It is a question of fairness, says Gene Burleson of Atlanta, who stood in line April 1 to appeal his assessment. His house has lost 25 percent of its value since it was last assessed, he adds: \"I'm just trying to insulate myself from coming tax increases.\" Property taxes have become a rallying point for disgruntled Americans because, unlike sales or income taxes, they can be challenged directly by individual citizens: Some 40 percent of assessment appeals are successful. Yet the movement threatens already stressed counties, putting the tax receipts that pays for schools and police at risk. This message has been edited.
