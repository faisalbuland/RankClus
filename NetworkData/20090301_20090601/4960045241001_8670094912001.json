The USS Ward fired on and SUNK a Japanese midget sub. It did not CAPTURE the sub. In addition the USS Ward did send a report back to Pearl Harbor and it was recieved. The mistake the skipper made was stating only that he attacked a submarine. He failed to mention that he had actually sunk one. Prior to the attack destoyers on patrol around Oahu had made all kinds of reports about attacking subs. What they actually did was kill a lot of fish. So the report got thrown in the pile. It was not until after the attack did they recognize the signifigance of the Ward report. Why don't you try reading At Dawn We Slept and throw away whatever books you have been reading about the subject. This message has been edited.

FDR pulled a Woodrow Wilson and claimed he didn't want to send \"our boys\" over there when running for re-election. Most wars can be traced to a set-up provocation like Hitler's attack on Poland and the Lusitania hauling armaments in its hull. I believe the OKC bombing was also a set-up because in previous months the FBI was frustratedn stemming the tide of the militia-movement.

In the movie Pearl Harbor it was realistic pretty much throughout especially the part about all those nurses showing up before the attack.

Our BN actually inherited the To&E of the NY unit which was deactivated in the vicinity of the WTC. Then after 9-11 the NY organization was prevented from fading away. I knew the CO of the very unit in charge of ground zero and he told me that on his way to work he was stuck in traffic on a bridge able to see the burning WTC and the second crash. He said there were people in the WTC calling the local radio station on their phones and hear could hear announcements over the PA in the WTC saying \"Do NOT evacuate this is an isolated incident\". This was needed to up the deathtoll so Americans would be more willing to go to war. Initially the deathtoll of the WTC was predicted at over 6,000 but ended up at less than half that amount.", 
        "reply": " Exactly as I see it and the counter info was the major part of the conspiracy since the plan was formulated years ago and vaulted away for fifty years. Operation Mongoose. The counter information was carefully considered for every possible scienerio and expanation to questions and accusations that would be asked. It only proves to me the control they have over the media and people. And its scary. We have signed our own death warrants by allowing it to fade away.",

The USS Ward fired on and SUNK a Japanese midget sub. It did not CAPTURE the sub. In addition the USS Ward did send a report back to Pearl Harbor and it was recieved. The mistake the skipper made was stating only that he attacked a submarine. He failed to mention that he had actually sunk one. Prior to the attack destoyers on patrol around Oahu had made all kinds of reports about attacking subs. What they actually did was kill a lot of fish. So the report got thrown in the pile. It was not until after the attack did they recognize the signifigance of the Ward report. Why don't you try reading At Dawn We Slept and throw away whatever books you have been reading about the subject. This message has been edited.

FDR pulled a Woodrow Wilson and claimed he didn't want to send \"our boys\" over there when running for re-election. Most wars can be traced to a set-up provocation like Hitler's attack on Poland and the Lusitania hauling armaments in its hull. I believe the OKC bombing was also a set-up because in previous months the FBI was frustratedn stemming the tide of the militia-movement.

In the movie Pearl Harbor it was realistic pretty much throughout especially the part about all those nurses showing up before the attack.

Liebs filmed interview and a photo of the Advertiser headline can be seen in the video \"Betrayal at Pearl Harbor\" which has been available at the PX. Nixon had less to do with the Watergate break-in than FDR had with the deaths of thousands. Yet Nixon resigned in disgrace while FDR is considered by many(not me) to have been one of our greatest presidents. You make all these statemnts but none are backed up by any facts. Supposedly Cordell Hull called a journalist and said Pearl Harbor was going to be attacked 12/7/41. Now why would he call a journalist of all people, freind or not. Or supposedly a freind. In a court of law you know what's this is called? Hearsay. Did you notice something about that headline JAPANESE MAY STRIKE OVER WEEKEND? It did not mention Pearl Harbor now did it? Don't you think that if MR. Lieb was given information that Pearl Harbor was going to be attacked they would have included that in the headline? You state its been proven that Churchill knew of the attack. Proven by WHO?",

        "quote": "Originally posted by StaffSgtGraham: Approx. 0930 Saturday 29Nov41 Sec'y-of-State Hull phoned his friend, journalist Joe Lieb, to meet ASAP. Hull then showed Lieb a transcript and stated emphatically \"The Japanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor on December seventh.\" Lieb immediately released this info to United Press International. The UP only put the word out on the foreign wire and it was printed in the Honolulu Advertiser with a bold headline at the very top of the front page \"JAPANESE MAY STRIKE OVER WEEKEND\". It was proven Churchill had prior knowledge of the PH attack so Cordell Hull must have gotten the word from British intel. The preponderance of the evidence shows FDR was culpable but there is still no smoking-gun. The fact FDR didn't live to see the end of HIS war is small consolation.

If you were trying to spare your carriers would you send the Enterprise to Wake Island which is west of Oahu and closer to Japanese held teritory. Or send the Lexington to Midway Island in the general direction of Kido Butai? Here's a historical fact that people like you seem to forget. The Enterprise was supposed to be inport that morning.

The Arizona was over a few decades old and Billy Mitchell had already proven it could be sunk by an airplane. FDR goaded Japan into attacking the US entirely so he could get the public to back going to war. The Japs attacked so we first went to war with Germany. Kinda' like when we went to Iraq instead of Afghanistan after 9/11. There has hardly been a war that hasn't been a set-up. In the words of FDR \"Nothing happens in politics by accident.\" Most of the US Navy, Army and Army Air Corps was obsolete in 1941. So it's not like the forces on Pearl Harbor were getting the rejects. The P-38 had just entered service and the P-47 and P-51 had yet to. On the Navy's side the Essex class carriers had just begun construction. The Navies two most modern battleships the North Carolina and Washington were just finsishing up their shakedown cruises when the attack happened. Billy Mitchell in the Navies eyes had proven that he could sink an old, staionary, undefended German battleship. The Navy added armor to the Arizona's deck to be able to withstand GP bombs of the day. Unfortanetly the USN did not anticipate the IJN modifying 16in armor piercing sheels to be droped from aircraft. Its a bad comparision the whole Japan/Germany and Afghanistan/Iraq thing. Technically we went to war with Japan first. It's not like the fighting with Japan became some sort of neglected backwater like Afghanistan. The fighting in the Pacific was just as brutal as in Europe. Also, Germany declared war on us. Iraq did not. Gemany and Japan were part of the Tripartite Pact. Iraq and Afghanistan had no such agreement.",
