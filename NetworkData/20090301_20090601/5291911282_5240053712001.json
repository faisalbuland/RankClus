But I won't lie, it's not easy if you're not in shape. I wasn't in great shape myself - I walked a lot before, but I didn't run. Fortunately, I had a natural aptitude for running. If you DON'T have that, Basic Training can be rather painful. So don't panic. But don't get complacent either. Start where you are. Walk laps at the local high school track. After a couple of days, try jogging one lap out of four. Work your way up to jogging four laps at a time. Then work on improving your time. (Only run every other day to start, and STOP for a while if you are injured.) Have someone teach you to do push-ups. Form is everything here - if you aren't doing them right, the Army at least won't count them at all. Do a lot of crunches. Do you play pick-up basketball or tennis or anything like that? Join a local volley ball team or something. Just get accustomed to being physically engaged most days. Work that nervousness out physically.",
