The show also talked about how important a \"one shot one kill\" idea was and that should the sniper miss, a mission could be blown, and the target would now be aware that he was a target and so on. It then occurred to me, instead of having a sniper with a rifle/scope and a spotter with a scope only, why not have both members of the team have rifles with scopes. The spotter could still play the part of a spotter but instead of the first sniper missing and the spotter saying \"damn you were low and to the left\". the second spotter could simply watch the first shot, know that the shot was low and to the left, and then take his shot a split second after the miss with the possible correction. At the very least, two shots fired from two trained experts a split second apart would certainly double your odds of a kill not to mention doubling your firepower and ammunition upon retreat.",

The show also talked about how important a \"one shot one kill\" idea was and that should the sniper miss, a mission could be blown, and the target would now be aware that he was a target and so on. It then occurred to me, instead of having a sniper with a rifle/scope and a spotter with a scope only, why not have both members of the team have rifles with scopes. The spotter could still play the part of a spotter but instead of the first sniper missing and the spotter saying \"damn you were low and to the left\". the second spotter could simply watch the first shot, know that the shot was low and to the left, and then take his shot a split second after the miss with the possible correction. At the very least, two shots fired from two trained experts a split second apart would certainly double your odds of a kill not to mention doubling your firepower and ammunition upon retreat. I am not a sniper, nor was my husband, but there are some flaws in your theory from what I can see... Two sniper set ups means twice the gear the carry while trying to get away (and besides, do you honestly think the spotter doesn't have a weapon? it's the friggin' military, everyone has a weapon); two shots would give away their position quicker (unless you're suggesting that they be in two different places meaning the spotter wouldn't be able to be the spotter for the sniper's position); snipers need to concentrate on the shot, the position of their weapon, the wind, their heartbeat and breathing... if he has to keep switching from one glass to another, his concentration would be non-existant on the target; oh and two shots fired for one kill are the same odds of one shot for no kills... it is better for the sniper to make the correction to his OWN shot than have someone else take another that could just as easily miss.
