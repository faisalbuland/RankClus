He decried partisan politics and in a speech last September said, \"We have real problems in this country right now and the American people are looking to us for answers, not distractions, no diversions, not manipulations.\" Yet, just weeks into his Administration the President's staff has been caught engaging in a coordinated and cynical political attack game - the very diversion and manipulation then-candidate Obama attacked the McCain campaign for last year. The apparent goal of this strategy was to distract public attention from the Democrats' massive spending proposals by depicting Rush Limbaugh as the new face of the Republican Party. Democrats needed the distraction -- over the course of only seven weeks of the current Congressional session, Senate Democrats have passed more spending than the previous Administration spent on Iraq, Afghanistan, and Katrina recovery combined. According to Politico newspaper yesterday, this coordinated strategy began with \"conversations and email exchanges\" taking place \"in and out of the White House\" between former Clinton political operative James Carville, the political team at the Democrat National Committee, and White House staff. The article goes on to note that \"a senior White House aide has been tasked with helping to guide the Limbaugh strategy.\" This is an outrage. It appears the Obama Administration has forgotten that the salaries of White House staff are paid for by you the taxpayer. To say nothing of the fact that this story reeks of hypocrisy coming from a President who campaigned against these very cynical political tactics last fall. President Obama owes the American people an explanation. His staff should apologize to the American people for supporting these tactics and diverting attention to the hard work that needs to be done to get America's economy back on track. Please join me in signing this petition and calling on the Obama White House to come clean on this matter.

HERSZENHORN Published: March 5, 2009 WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a $410 billion omnibus spending measure on Thursday night, forcing Congressional Democrats to prepare a stopgap budget resolution to keep the federal government from shutting down. The ability of the diminished minority to delay the bill signaled growing unease in Congress, among Democrats and Republicans, over the levels of government spending in recent months and the staggering increase in the federal deficit. The delay of the bill was an embarrassment for Democrats and a striking, if temporary, victory for critics of so-called earmark spending initiatives, who had criticized the bill as bloated with wasteful expenditures. Although Republicans were glad to needle the Democrats by delaying the bill, there are reasons not to scuttle it. Doing so would result in a $8.4 million budget cut for Senate Republican committees, forcing staff layoffs. Also, Republicans, like Democrats, would lose the home-state projects, or earmarks, totaling more than $7 billion in the bill. In all, the bill would provide about $19 billion more than if a stopgap measure were used through the end of the fiscal year.",

He decried partisan politics and in a speech last September said, \"We have real problems in this country right now and the American people are looking to us for answers, not distractions, no diversions, not manipulations.\" Yet, just weeks into his Administration the President's staff has been caught engaging in a coordinated and cynical political attack game - the very diversion and manipulation then-candidate Obama attacked the McCain campaign for last year. The apparent goal of this strategy was to distract public attention from the Democrats' massive spending proposals by depicting Rush Limbaugh as the new face of the Republican Party. Democrats needed the distraction -- over the course of only seven weeks of the current Congressional session, Senate Democrats have passed more spending than the previous Administration spent on Iraq, Afghanistan, and Katrina recovery combined. According to Politico newspaper yesterday, this coordinated strategy began with \"conversations and email exchanges\" taking place \"in and out of the White House\" between former Clinton political operative James Carville, the political team at the Democrat National Committee, and White House staff. The article goes on to note that \"a senior White House aide has been tasked with helping to guide the Limbaugh strategy.\" This is an outrage. It appears the Obama Administration has forgotten that the salaries of White House staff are paid for by you the taxpayer. To say nothing of the fact that this story reeks of hypocrisy coming from a President who campaigned against these very cynical political tactics last fall. President Obama owes the American people an explanation. His staff should apologize to the American people for supporting these tactics and diverting attention to the hard work that needs to be done to get America's economy back on track. Please join me in signing this petition and calling on the Obama White House to come clean on this matter. Join me in asking them to work with Republicans on the critical issues facing our country today. The American people deserve better than diversions and manipulations. Sincerely, Senator John Cornyn Chairman National Republican Senatorial Committee Have you noticed the same distraction here in the discussions. Notice the topics that continue to pop back to the top.",

HERSZENHORN Published: March 5, 2009 WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a $410 billion omnibus spending measure on Thursday night, forcing Congressional Democrats to prepare a stopgap budget resolution to keep the federal government from shutting down. The ability of the diminished minority to delay the bill signaled growing unease in Congress, among Democrats and Republicans, over the levels of government spending in recent months and the staggering increase in the federal deficit. The delay of the bill was an embarrassment for Democrats and a striking, if temporary, victory for critics of so-called earmark spending initiatives, who had criticized the bill as bloated with wasteful expenditures. Although Republicans were glad to needle the Democrats by delaying the bill, there are reasons not to scuttle it. Doing so would result in a $8.4 million budget cut for Senate Republican committees, forcing staff layoffs. Also, Republicans, like Democrats, would lose the home-state projects, or earmarks, totaling more than $7 billion in the bill. In all, the bill would provide about $19 billion more than if a stopgap measure were used through the end of the fiscal year.",

The apparent goal of this strategy was to distract public attention from the Democrats' massive spending proposals by depicting Rush Limbaugh as the new face of the Republican Party.

        "content": "In Senate, Republicans Block Spending Measure NY Times By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN Published: March 5, 2009 WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a $410 billion omnibus spending measure on Thursday night, forcing Congressional Democrats to prepare a stopgap budget resolution to keep the federal government from shutting down. The ability of the diminished minority to delay the bill signaled growing unease in Congress, among Democrats and Republicans, over the levels of government spending in recent months and the staggering increase in the federal deficit. The delay of the bill was an embarrassment for Democrats and a striking, if temporary, victory for critics of so-called earmark spending initiatives, who had criticized the bill as bloated with wasteful expenditures. Although Republicans were glad to needle the Democrats by delaying the bill, there are reasons not to scuttle it. Doing so would result in a $8.4 million budget cut for Senate Republican committees, forcing staff layoffs. Also, Republicans, like Democrats, would lose the home-state projects, or earmarks, totaling more than $7 billion in the bill. In all, the bill would provide about $19 billion more than if a stopgap measure were used through the end of the fiscal year.",

        "reply": "In Senate, Republicans Block Spending Measure NY Times By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN Published: March 5, 2009 WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a $410 billion omnibus spending measure on Thursday night, forcing Congressional Democrats to prepare a stopgap budget resolution to keep the federal government from shutting down. The ability of the diminished minority to delay the bill signaled growing unease in Congress, among Democrats and Republicans, over the levels of government spending in recent months and the staggering increase in the federal deficit. The delay of the bill was an embarrassment for Democrats and a striking, if temporary, victory for critics of so-called earmark spending initiatives, who had criticized the bill as bloated with wasteful expenditures. Although Republicans were glad to needle the Democrats by delaying the bill, there are reasons not to scuttle it. Doing so would result in a $8.4 million budget cut for Senate Republican committees, forcing staff layoffs. Also, Republicans, like Democrats, would lose the home-state projects, or earmarks, totaling more than $7 billion in the bill. In all, the bill would provide about $19 billion more than if a stopgap measure were used through the end of the fiscal year.",

The apparent goal of this strategy was to distract public attention from the Democrats' massive spending proposals by depicting Rush Limbaugh as the new face of the Republican Party. Democrats needed the distraction -- over the course of only seven weeks of the current Congressional session, Senate Democrats have passed more spending than the previous Administration spent on Iraq, Afghanistan, and Katrina recovery combined. According to Politico newspaper yesterday, this coordinated strategy began with \"conversations and email exchanges\" taking place \"in and out of the White House\" between former Clinton political operative James Carville, the political team at the Democrat National Committee, and White House staff. The article goes on to note that \"a senior White House aide has been tasked with helping to guide the Limbaugh strategy.\" This is an outrage. It appears the Obama Administration has forgotten that the salaries of White House staff are paid for by you the taxpayer. To say nothing of the fact that this story reeks of hypocrisy coming from a President who campaigned against these very cynical political tactics last fall. President Obama owes the American people an explanation. His staff should apologize to the American people for supporting these tactics and diverting attention to the hard work that needs to be done to get America's economy back on track. Please join me in signing this petition and calling on the Obama White House to come clean on this matter.
