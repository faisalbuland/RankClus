Palestinian villagers were surrounded by dozens of foreigners singing and waving flags. They turned and headed out to the olive-tree fields and up towards the broad path of Israel's West Bank barrier. There, behind a concrete hilltop bunker, the Israeli soldiers looked down on them. The crowd approached the barrier, still singing. One man flew a paper kite shaped as a plane. \"This land is a closed military zone,\" an Israeli soldier shouted in flawless Arabic over a loudspeaker. \"You are not allowed near the wall.\" Then the soldiers fired a barrage of teargas. It has been like this every Friday in the village of Bil'in for more than four years \u2013 the most persistent popular demonstration against Israel's vast steel and concrete barrier. It is a protest founded on non-violence that is spreading to other West Bank villages. But it has become increasingly dangerous. On April 17, on the hillside at Bil'in, a Palestinian named Basem Abu Rahmeh, 31, was shot with a high-velocity Israeli teargas canister that sliced a hole into his chest, caused massive internal bleeding and quickly killed him. Video footage shot by another demonstrator shows he was unarmed, many metres from the barrier and posing no threat to the soldiers. The Israeli military said it faced a \"violent and illegal riot\" and is investigating. On Friday the demonstrators at Bil'in wore Rameh's image on T-shirts and carried it on posters. Last month another demonstrator, an American named Tristan Anderson, 38, was hit in the head by an identical high-velocity teargas canister in a protest against the barrier at the nearby village of Na'alin.

Bladensburg-If you mean the vote of UN in favor of creating Israel, my answer will be Yes. The majority of the reasoning that counted in UN vote were the refugees and the testimonies from death camps. With these, Zionist leadership made propaganda, and the British acted like morons, sending refugees into the same camps/states they have run from. The terrorist activity by Irgun, Lehi etc, was largely irrelevant to the issue. The only thing that they have achieved was to hurry the process a bit. The Jewish terror was not worth it in my opinion. Israel could have been created half a year or even a year later and noting especially awful would have happened.

If you think that Blowing buses is redeemed by peaceful demonstrations, you are wrong. It doesn't seem to make any difference to some Israelis that people on the west bank, coming near a wall that didn't exist until a year ago, to protest that the wall has cut them off from their livlihood and AlFatah terrorists blowing up buses and firing rockets, may not be the same. It appears that there is some 'slow learning' involved in developing the notion that there are people who will fight you to keep their land as hard as you fight them to take it. If they had the panalopy of arms that Israel has been enabled to amass, they might use them, as Israel does, in their own 'defence'. As it is, often they have only a stone, or even just a voice, to fight with. The world knows the sensitivity, and the hard hand, of the Israel-ite to 'offence' - real, or imagined. Once before Judeans called out for someone's blood - \"on our heads and our children\".It worked so well, that, to-day, it's attributed to Arabs - and they're punished accordingly.
