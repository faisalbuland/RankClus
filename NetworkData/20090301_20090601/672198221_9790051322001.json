Someone sent me an e-mail of a picture of one billion dollars in Hundred dollar bills stacked on pallets 2 high 6'X 16' X 200+' And it was mind staggering to imagine 12,000 times that size. But then thats chump change the way they toss money around today. I remember as a kid they had a call in Radio show the 25,000 dollar jackpot. People would tune in and fantasize what the would do with 25,000 dollars. Retire was always the first thing then buy a lavish house, and a new car, cruise the world, and take care of all thier relatives. that I believe was in the late forties. today that dont even buy a luxury used car.

Someone sent me an e-mail of a picture of one billion dollars in Hundred dollar bills stacked on pallets 2 high 6'X 16' X 200+' And it was mind staggering to imagine 12,000 times that size. But then thats chump change the way they toss money around today. I remember as a kid they had a call in Radio show the 25,000 dollar jackpot. People would tune in and fantasize what the would do with 25,000 dollars. Retire was always the first thing then buy a lavish house, and a new car, cruise the world, and take care of all thier relatives. that I believe was in the late forties. today that dont even buy a luxury used car.
