Bennies (pay, travel, college (small potatoes, but a thought anyway), 30 day/year leave, chance to work on guided missile stuff... wow. 3 - Nobody in my family had served (except an older 1st cousin in the AF), thought I might one-up them. 4. For someplace to go when I left home and mama. 5. Impress the girls (it even worked now and then). 6. Uniform. 7. Oh, yeah, somewhere in my kid head, I thought it would be cool to do some patriotic thing. Best three years of my life, don't regret a thing, would do it all over, glad it's behind me This message has been edited. Last edited by: cheapthrills, Thu 21 May 2009 06:13 PM",

My entire family has been military: Dad was a career Marine (Korea and 'Nam),; mom was Navy ('Nam, one of the few WACS there), and all 4 grandparents were Air Force / Army Air Corps. Sadly, I could adorn a small house with folded American flags with the 21st shell enfolded in its final fold. I am the only one left, and my brother refused service. 8 decades of legacy die with me. But I also -- one day -- look(ed) around, and I saw God in everything. Yeah, He was in church. But also where I fished, where I hunted, in that silence and that morning sunrise. And I wanted everyone to know what I felt at that very moment. I knew that only free men had it. I knew that men like my dad secured freedoms for people who just would not appreciate that enough themselves to serve. And I made a vow that I would serve, and I would be 5 soldiers in one for the 4 that refused to serve. I did my best, and I gave my all, and I don't regret a single, solitary second of it. People were counting on me to just do more. I will die knowing that I did. And I did it for everyone. And I did it for this nation. And Jesus will tell me, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" I served because my fortitude demanded me to. To help that man next to me who was doing his \"I am five soldiers, not one\" thing. Because I like Mayberry townships. Because my mom and did would have been proud (and I'd like to think are). Because my brother didn't, and because you had a choice not to. One day, some 14-year old kid with a 16-gauge shotgun is going to recognize the morning desert beauty and just stop. And he's going to see what I saw painted there on that canvas: God, sacrifice, love, honor, and maybe even tradition. And maybe that young man will decide that he needs to be part of the solution instead of being part of the problem. Just as I did. And he'll make his mom cry when he tells her that he is leaving, but he'll also notice the pride in her eyes through the occlusion of those tears. And he'll leave, and somehow, somewhere, at sometime, the tradition will continue. I served for that. Because every man next to me was once that 14-year old kid. That works for me. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

Sadly, I could adorn a small house with folded American flags with the 21st shell enfolded in its final fold. I am the only one left, and my brother refused service. 8 decades of legacy die with me. But I also -- one day -- look(ed) around, and I saw God in everything. Yeah, He was in church. But also where I fished, where I hunted, in that silence and that morning sunrise. And I wanted everyone to know what I felt at that very moment. I knew that only free men had it. I knew that men like my dad secured freedoms for people who just would not appreciate that enough themselves to serve. And I made a vow that I would serve, and I would be 5 soldiers in one for the 4 that refused to serve. I did my best, and I gave my all, and I don't regret a single, solitary second of it. People were counting on me to just do more. I will die knowing that I did. And I did it for everyone. And I did it for this nation. And Jesus will tell me, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" I served because my fortitude demanded me to. To help that man next to me who was doing his \"I am five soldiers, not one\" thing.

One day, some 14-year old kid with a 16-gauge shotgun is going to recognize the morning desert beauty and just stop. And he's going to see what I saw painted there on that canvas: God, sacrifice, love, honor, and maybe even tradition. And maybe that young man will decide that he needs to be part of the solution instead of being part of the problem. Just as I did. And he'll make his mom cry when he tells her that he is leaving, but he'll also notice the pride in her eyes through the occlusion of those tears. And he'll leave, and somehow, somewhere, at sometime, the tradition will continue. I served for that. Because every man next to me was once that 14-year old kid. That works for me. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

My entire family has been military: Dad was a career Marine (Korea and 'Nam),; mom was Navy ('Nam, one of the few WACS there), and all 4 grandparents were Air Force / Army Air Corps. Sadly, I could adorn a small house with folded American flags with the 21st shell enfolded in its final fold. I am the only one left, and my brother refused service. 8 decades of legacy die with me. But I also -- one day -- look(ed) around, and I saw God in everything. Yeah, He was in church. But also where I fished, where I hunted, in that silence and that morning sunrise. And I wanted everyone to know what I felt at that very moment. I knew that only free men had it. I knew that men like my dad secured freedoms for people who just would not appreciate that enough themselves to serve. And I made a vow that I would serve, and I would be 5 soldiers in one for the 4 that refused to serve. I did my best, and I gave my all, and I don't regret a single, solitary second of it. People were counting on me to just do more. I will die knowing that I did. And I did it for everyone. And I did it for this nation. And Jesus will tell me, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" I served because my fortitude demanded me to. To help that man next to me who was doing his \"I am five soldiers, not one\" thing. Because I like Mayberry townships. Because my mom and did would have been proud (and I'd like to think are). Because my brother didn't, and because you had a choice not to. One day, some 14-year old kid with a 16-gauge shotgun is going to recognize the morning desert beauty and just stop. And he's going to see what I saw painted there on that canvas: God, sacrifice, love, honor, and maybe even tradition. And maybe that young man will decide that he needs to be part of the solution instead of being part of the problem. Just as I did. And he'll make his mom cry when he tells her that he is leaving, but he'll also notice the pride in her eyes through the occlusion of those tears. And he'll leave, and somehow, somewhere, at sometime, the tradition will continue. I served for that. Because every man next to me was once that 14-year old kid. That works for me. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

My entire family has been military: Dad was a career Marine (Korea and 'Nam),; mom was Navy ('Nam, one of the few WACS there), and all 4 grandparents were Air Force / Army Air Corps. Sadly, I could adorn a small house with folded American flags with the 21st shell enfolded in its final fold. I am the only one left, and my brother refused service. 8 decades of legacy die with me. But I also -- one day -- look(ed) around, and I saw God in everything. Yeah, He was in church. But also where I fished, where I hunted, in that silence and that morning sunrise. And I wanted everyone to know what I felt at that very moment. I knew that only free men had it. I knew that men like my dad secured freedoms for people who just would not appreciate that enough themselves to serve. And I made a vow that I would serve, and I would be 5 soldiers in one for the 4 that refused to serve. I did my best, and I gave my all, and I don't regret a single, solitary second of it. People were counting on me to just do more. I will die knowing that I did. And I did it for everyone. And I did it for this nation. And Jesus will tell me, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" I served because my fortitude demanded me to. To help that man next to me who was doing his \"I am five soldiers, not one\" thing. Because I like Mayberry townships. Because my mom and did would have been proud (and I'd like to think are). Because my brother didn't, and because you had a choice not to. One day, some 14-year old kid with a 16-gauge shotgun is going to recognize the morning desert beauty and just stop. And he's going to see what I saw painted there on that canvas: God, sacrifice, love, honor, and maybe even tradition. And maybe that young man will decide that he needs to be part of the solution instead of being part of the problem. Just as I did. And he'll make his mom cry when he tells her that he is leaving, but he'll also notice the pride in her eyes through the occlusion of those tears. And he'll leave, and somehow, somewhere, at sometime, the tradition will continue. I served for that. Because every man next to me was once that 14-year old kid. That works for me. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
