Catholic Bishops Condemn Proposed Bill Bishops Claim Bill Would Strip Church Control Over Finances POSTED: 10:46 am EDT March 9, 2009 UPDATED: 3:48 pm EDT March 9, 2009 BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- Connecticut's Catholic bishops are condemning a bill that they claim would strip the church of control of its finances. The Religious Corporations Act introduced by the Legislature's Judiciary Committee would allow local parishioners to control their individual church's financial affairs. Bridgeport Bishop William Lori Sunday delivered a harsh rebuke to the proposal, saying it jeopardizes the religious liberty of the church. Lori and Hartford Bishop Henry Mansell are calling on Catholics to attend a Judiciary Committee public hearing Wednesday in Hartford to protest the bill. House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr. said his office has been \"swamped'' with calls and e-mail from constituents throughout the state who are outraged by the proposal. He said the proposal is pushed by Democratic lawmakers who have feuded with the church hierarchy on myriad issues in the past. \"To say that people are outraged over this proposal to bar the Catholic Church from overseeing its own finances is being charitable,\" he said. \"This bill has provoked a lot of people. The state of Connecticut is billions of dollars in debt and some Democratic lawmakers want to dictate to the Catholic Church how it manages its finances. That does not make sense to a lot of people.'' State Sen. Andrew McDonald, D-Stamford, said that any parish wishing to could leave its affairs under diocesan control. \"It has been incorrectly characterized that this legislation originated from the two of us as an attack on the church and freedom of religion,\" Statement of Judiciary Committee Co-Chairmen McDonald and Rep. Mike Lawlor, D-East Haven. \"That is not the truth, and the facts do not support such a claim. \"We ourselves are questioning certain aspects of their proposal and even the constitutionality of the current law,\" the statement reads. \"Despite what has been portrayed, we have not endorsed, nor are advocating for, this proposal.\" McDonald said a prime mover behind the bill is the financial mismanagement in which a priest was convicted of stealing up to $1.4 million from a Darien church.",

You are an individual and, as such, are free to exercise your franchise as you see fit; no problem! The Church (whichever) is not an individual; it is an (hopefully) apolitical entity which is granted a tax exemption for being apolitical! The Minister/Pastor/et.al. of said organization is the public face of that organization; the church, and therefore it's official representative, cannot influence the exercise of the political franchise of the individuals who make up its congregation without violating the terms of its tax-exempt status! The individuals are free to do as they will as individuals, but not as official representatives of their church! Simple! So a priest is not allowed to teach / speak to his congregation about the Catholic Church's doctrine on such issues as gay marriage, abortion, ect. for fear it could \"influence\" how I'll vote? Personally, I'd call that a \"grey area;\" The Church can not TELL you how to vote, but certainly it's free to explain it's internal doctrine to it's adherants, but it would come down to a Judgement call when they cross the line! It's a \"Gordian knot\" to be sure! I decide for myself without the influence of any sort of spiritual dogma! It's likely that you do too, but (rhetorical question here) how can you ever be absolutely certain that you vote a given way because you truly feel that way or because your spiritual leader tells you that is the way you must feel in order for you to gain the approval of your deity? Heady stuff, religion!",

Catholic Bishops Condemn Proposed Bill Bishops Claim Bill Would Strip Church Control Over Finances POSTED: 10:46 am EDT March 9, 2009 UPDATED: 3:48 pm EDT March 9, 2009 BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- Connecticut's Catholic bishops are condemning a bill that they claim would strip the church of control of its finances. The Religious Corporations Act introduced by the Legislature's Judiciary Committee would allow local parishioners to control their individual church's financial affairs. Bridgeport Bishop William Lori Sunday delivered a harsh rebuke to the proposal, saying it jeopardizes the religious liberty of the church. Lori and Hartford Bishop Henry Mansell are calling on Catholics to attend a Judiciary Committee public hearing Wednesday in Hartford to protest the bill. House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr. said his office has been \"swamped'' with calls and e-mail from constituents throughout the state who are outraged by the proposal. He said the proposal is pushed by Democratic lawmakers who have feuded with the church hierarchy on myriad issues in the past. \"To say that people are outraged over this proposal to bar the Catholic Church from overseeing its own finances is being charitable,\" he said. \"This bill has provoked a lot of people. The state of Connecticut is billions of dollars in debt and some Democratic lawmakers want to dictate to the Catholic Church how it manages its finances. That does not make sense to a lot of people.'' State Sen. Andrew McDonald, D-Stamford, said that any parish wishing to could leave its affairs under diocesan control. \"It has been incorrectly characterized that this legislation originated from the two of us as an attack on the church and freedom of religion,\" Statement of Judiciary Committee Co-Chairmen McDonald and Rep. Mike Lawlor, D-East Haven. \"That is not the truth, and the facts do not support such a claim. \"We ourselves are questioning certain aspects of their proposal and even the constitutionality of the current law,\" the statement reads. \"Despite what has been portrayed, we have not endorsed, nor are advocating for, this proposal.\" McDonald said a prime mover behind the bill is the financial mismanagement in which a priest was convicted of stealing up to $1.4 million from a Darien church.",

Catholic Bishops Condemn Proposed Bill Bishops Claim Bill Would Strip Church Control Over Finances POSTED: 10:46 am EDT March 9, 2009 UPDATED: 3:48 pm EDT March 9, 2009 BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- Connecticut's Catholic bishops are condemning a bill that they claim would strip the church of control of its finances. The Religious Corporations Act introduced by the Legislature's Judiciary Committee would allow local parishioners to control their individual church's financial affairs. Bridgeport Bishop William Lori Sunday delivered a harsh rebuke to the proposal, saying it jeopardizes the religious liberty of the church. Lori and Hartford Bishop Henry Mansell are calling on Catholics to attend a Judiciary Committee public hearing Wednesday in Hartford to protest the bill. House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr. said his office has been \"swamped'' with calls and e-mail from constituents throughout the state who are outraged by the proposal. He said the proposal is pushed by Democratic lawmakers who have feuded with the church hierarchy on myriad issues in the past. \"To say that people are outraged over this proposal to bar the Catholic Church from overseeing its own finances is being charitable,\" he said. \"This bill has provoked a lot of people. The state of Connecticut is billions of dollars in debt and some Democratic lawmakers want to dictate to the Catholic Church how it manages its finances. That does not make sense to a lot of people.'' State Sen. Andrew McDonald, D-Stamford, said that any parish wishing to could leave its affairs under diocesan control. \"It has been incorrectly characterized that this legislation originated from the two of us as an attack on the church and freedom of religion,\" Statement of Judiciary Committee Co-Chairmen McDonald and Rep. Mike Lawlor, D-East Haven. \"That is not the truth, and the facts do not support such a claim. \"We ourselves are questioning certain aspects of their proposal and even the constitutionality of the current law,\" the statement reads. \"Despite what has been portrayed, we have not endorsed, nor are advocating for, this proposal.\" McDonald said a prime mover behind the bill is the financial mismanagement in which a priest was convicted of stealing up to $1.4 million from a Darien church.",
