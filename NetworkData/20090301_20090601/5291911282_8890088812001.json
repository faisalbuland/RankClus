What he failed to mention is that Weber was a Child Molestor. Weber was a central pivot in Mayor Bloomburg's ABC broadcast. Now, it seems, Bloomburg was working/socializing with a Child Molestor. Media doesn't know what to think. No one is calling Weber out for being a predatory Sex Offender. It has become a side story today on NY Post website. It was front page news this morning... The 16 year old was a sicko. But he won't get life or anything because he was a vicitim. I don't see Weber getting any news accolades.",
