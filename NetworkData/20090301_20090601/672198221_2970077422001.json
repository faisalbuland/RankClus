It was flying at 35,000 feet (10,670 meters) and traveling at 522 mph (840 kph). About a half-hour later, the plane \"crossed through a thunderous zone with strong turbulence.\" It sent an automatic message fourteen minutes later at 0214 GMT (10:14 p.m. EDT Sunday) reporting electrical failure and a loss of cabin pressure. Obviously something either blew the plane from the outside in, or the inside out... Weather experts say that tropical storms rise up to 50,000 ft, and this plane would have flown right into the most electrified part of the storm, the top. Its strange, these planes are actually tested to withstand lightning strikes so wtf?",

About a half-hour later, the plane \"crossed through a thunderous zone with strong turbulence.\" It sent an automatic message fourteen minutes later at 0214 GMT (10:14 p.m. EDT Sunday) reporting electrical failure and a loss of cabin pressure. Obviously something either blew the plane from the outside in, or the inside out... Weather experts say that tropical storms rise up to 50,000 ft, and this plane would have flown right into the most electrified part of the storm, the top.
