But watching the show, it really did seem like it was a pretty good evening for the guest, the host and Tonight itself. To be sure, there were moments that required some adjustment.

        "quote": "You've certainly never seen one quite like it before: President Barack Obama's appearance on NBC's Tonight Show With Jay Leno Thursday night was the first such late-night guest spot by a sitting president. Not everyone was thrilled by the prospect; some found the idea unpresidential, and others simply think this particular president risks being overexposed. But watching the show, it really did seem like it was a pretty good evening for the guest, the host and Tonight itself. To be sure, there were moments that required some adjustment. We're not used to seeing presidents in such informal TV interview settings, and they're generally not used to having to follow jokes about Madonna's dating habits and St. Patrick's Day shot glasses. The show is what it is, but for the most part at least, Tonight accommodated itself to Obama rather than the other way around. There was a monologue at the start and a one-song performance by Garth Brooks at the end, but otherwise the entire show was devoted to Leno's interview with Obama. And even Brooks' appearance was clearly presented by Leno as a way to make the show even more \"special.\" Wisely, Obama did not try to reshape his style or approach to fit the show; he may have kidded with Leno some, but he was there as president, not as entertainer-in-chief. Calm, witty and in control, he came to deliver a message \u2014 the economy is in trouble, but it will recover \u2014 and that's what he did, with very few diversions. And he did it, you'd have to think, without inflicting any damage on the integrity of the presidency. Whatever one thinks of his policies, no one can accuse Obama of lacking gravity or dignity. He doesn't need any particularly setting to bestow those qualities on him; he carries them with him. (.....)",
