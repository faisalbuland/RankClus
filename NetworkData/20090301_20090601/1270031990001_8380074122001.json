If you take a glimpse into the mirror or better yet back at all your clamorring posts of discontent toward religion while dominating these threads you will see paranoia. And then ask yourself why do you fear God while I celebrate Him. I am just establishing a foundation for a remedy. I am happy to see you speak of what I also believe the sensible conclusions the majority of Atheists should feel. You say that you agree that the country should be as religious as it wants to be but then your always here stifling their expression and prayer with insults to their intelligence. It is if you are on a mission to dominate them into submission into believing that God should not be a part of the government. But the people are the government. What they believe and their morality is inside all legislation. Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. - bill b right - not - bill of rights - just - wrong - no fear here. - LegionSon -",

What, exactly, are you afraid of that makes you clamor on and on about this stuff? No atheist wants this to be a country where religion is forbidden; far from it. We simply don't want a government dominated by religious people via the government. The country can be as religious as it wants to be; just not the government. And, you wouldn't want it either, if you could think it through for a moment. What kind of country do you suppose this would be if the dominant religions were allowed to hold sway... then, down the road, a different religion becomes the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre? Would you like Muslims deciding what to pray in school? Of course not. That's why the government can't favor one practice of conscience over another... plain and simple. It must always strive to be neutral. You want to get all flag-wavy and say what a wonderful thing our country is: this is the reason. We have a gov't that's strictly neutral in matters of conscience and does the bidding of the people... all of them.", 
        "reply": " Hello again billbright, My paranoia? my clamor? My fear? If you take a glimpse into the mirror or better yet back at all your clamorring posts of discontent toward religion while dominating these threads you will see paranoia. And then ask yourself why do you fear God while I celebrate Him. I am just establishing a foundation for a remedy. I am happy to see you speak of what I also believe the sensible conclusions the majority of Atheists should feel. You say that you agree that the country should be as religious as it wants to be but then your always here stifling their expression and prayer with insults to their intelligence. It is if you are on a mission to dominate them into submission into believing that God should not be a part of the government. But the people are the government. What they believe and their morality is inside all legislation. Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. - bill b right - not - bill of rights - just - wrong - no fear here. - LegionSon -",

What, exactly, are you afraid of that makes you clamor on and on about this stuff? No atheist wants this to be a country where religion is forbidden; far from it. We simply don't want a government dominated by religious people via the government. The country can be as religious as it wants to be; just not the government. And, you wouldn't want it either, if you could think it through for a moment. What kind of country do you suppose this would be if the dominant religions were allowed to hold sway... then, down the road, a different religion becomes the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre? Would you like Muslims deciding what to pray in school? Of course not. That's why the government can't favor one practice of conscience over another... plain and simple. It must always strive to be neutral. You want to get all flag-wavy and say what a wonderful thing our country is: this is the reason. We have a gov't that's strictly neutral in matters of conscience and does the bidding of the people... all of them. Hello again billbright, My paranoia? my clamor? My fear? If you take a glimpse into the mirror or better yet back at all your clamorring posts of discontent toward religion while dominating these threads you will see paranoia. And then ask yourself why do you fear God while I celebrate Him. I am just establishing a foundation for a remedy. I am happy to see you speak of what I also believe the sensible conclusions the majority of Atheists should feel. You say that you agree that the country should be as religious as it wants to be but then your always here stifling their expression and prayer with insults to their intelligence. It is if you are on a mission to dominate them into submission into believing that God should not be a part of the government. But the people are the government. What they believe and their morality is inside all legislation. Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. - bill b right - not - bill of rights - just - wrong - no fear here. - LegionSon - You have no idea what you're talking about, nor do you have any idea how many people you just ticked off. Those who prefer to be free from religion have precisely... precisely... the same amount of right to be in this country as those who prefer to delude themselves with various mythologies. As for the contributions from the deluded godly, the only thing they contributed to the process of making the Constitution were to slow and confuse the process. Transcriptional detail of the meetings during the construction of the Constitution pointed to a very Taliban-like insistence by the religious to include God in the tract. But... cooler heads prevailed, and we, intelligently, wound up with a neutral government. Yet here we are... two hundred thirty-three years later still listening to the irrational blatherings of preacher-wannabees trying to throw away that very valuable neutrality. And it's still paranoia that's doing it. Why do you people hate absolutely everybody? What, exactly, do you lose if atheists exist in your country? Contrary to what you have said bill it is in reality you who have a hard time comprehending the subject or the intent of this thread. Maybe we are just having a misunderstanding in terminology. We are a country with \"freedom of religion\" where you can choose to believe in God or not through various faith structures. So then in contrast a country with \"freedom from religion\" would be a country with no religion allowed. Maybe you expect me to fall victim to your same understanding and usage of the terms that you have become comfortable with. But at least now you can understand where I stand on the subject. I won't head to the seemingly subtle difference. The language of our laws and the Constitution are based on \"freedom of religion\" not \"freedom from religion\". I see no need to change it or accept new terms. So, we do agree then that those who don't believe in God are welcome. I never said anything to the contrary.

You keep mentioning your \"preconceptions or irrational suspicions\" such as in this statement of yours ---> \"Why do you people hate absolutely everybody? What, exactly, do you lose if atheists exist in your country?\" Nowhere have I or any of the others you refer to as \"you people\" stated such horrible ideas. And you call me paranoid...could you possibly have a brain tumor? You constantly try to incorporate this idea where it does not apply. And now I think you should talk to someone about all these \"hidden agendas\" you see. Oooooo it does sound scarey I admit. It's going to be okay billy...for over 2 hundred years now it has been okay. hehh, Get a life man...and stop trying to change the words to the Constitution to suit your beliefs. and remember ...Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. The founders chose the words carefully bill. We are a country with \"freedom of religion\" where you can choose to believe in God or not through various faith structures. So then in contrast a country with \"freedom from religion\" would be a country with no religion allowed. Maybe you expect me to fall victim to your same understanding and usage of the terms that you have become comfortable with. But at least now you can understand where I stand on the subject. I won't head to the seemingly subtle difference. The language of our laws and the Constitution are based on \"freedom of religion\" not \"freedom from religion\". I see no need to change it or accept new terms. - LegionSon -",

Hey KJ1110...you bring up a great perspective of the importance of the word \"their\"...one that I would agree with. The mere fact that \"all men were created equal\"... \"with certain unalienable rights\" does not destinguish any preference over their individual belief structure either. Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness is the rights to \"all men\". These were and I believe still are recognized as God given rights from \"their Creator\".

It is not 'us' believers in god who are 'the people'. It's 'we', regardless of what you think about any gods. More people came to this country to escape religion than practice it, LS. We have more Christians now than ever (yet only about 37% of the population are 'practicing' Christians.

What, exactly, are you afraid of that makes you clamor on and on about this stuff? No atheist wants this to be a country where religion is forbidden; far from it. We simply don't want a government dominated by religious people via the government. The country can be as religious as it wants to be; just not the government. And, you wouldn't want it either, if you could think it through for a moment. What kind of country do you suppose this would be if the dominant religions were allowed to hold sway... then, down the road, a different religion becomes the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre? Would you like Muslims deciding what to pray in school? Of course not. That's why the government can't favor one practice of conscience over another... plain and simple. It must always strive to be neutral. You want to get all flag-wavy and say what a wonderful thing our country is: this is the reason. We have a gov't that's strictly neutral in matters of conscience and does the bidding of the people... all of them. Hello again billbright, My paranoia? my clamor? My fear? If you take a glimpse into the mirror or better yet back at all your clamorring posts of discontent toward religion while dominating these threads you will see paranoia. And then ask yourself why do you fear God while I celebrate Him. I am just establishing a foundation for a remedy. I am happy to see you speak of what I also believe the sensible conclusions the majority of Atheists should feel. You say that you agree that the country should be as religious as it wants to be but then your always here stifling their expression and prayer with insults to their intelligence. It is if you are on a mission to dominate them into submission into believing that God should not be a part of the government. But the people are the government. What they believe and their morality is inside all legislation. Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. - bill b right - not - bill of rights - just - wrong - no fear here. - LegionSon - You have no idea what you're talking about, nor do you have any idea how many people you just ticked off.

Contrary to what you have said bill it is in reality you who have a hard time comprehending the subject or the intent of this thread. Maybe we are just having a misunderstanding in terminology. We are a country with \"freedom of religion\" where you can choose to believe in God or not through various faith structures. So then in contrast a country with \"freedom from religion\" would be a country with no religion allowed. Maybe you expect me to fall victim to your same understanding and usage of the terms that you have become comfortable with. But at least now you can understand where I stand on the subject. I won't head to the seemingly subtle difference. The language of our laws and the Constitution are based on \"freedom of religion\" not \"freedom from religion\". I see no need to change it or accept new terms. So, we do agree then that those who don't believe in God are welcome. I never said anything to the contrary. Also bill I don't know why you keep mentioning your preconceptions or irrational suspicions such as in this statement of yours ---> \"Why do you people hate absolutely everybody? What, exactly, do you lose if atheists exist in your country?\" Nowhere have I or any of the others you refer to as \"you people\" stated such horrible ideas.

We have a gov't that's strictly neutral in matters of conscience and does the bidding of the people... all of them. Hello again billbright, My paranoia? my clamor? My fear? If you take a glimpse into the mirror or better yet back at all your clamorring posts of discontent toward religion while dominating these threads you will see paranoia. And then ask yourself why do you fear God while I celebrate Him. I am just establishing a foundation for a remedy. I am happy to see you speak of what I also believe the sensible conclusions the majority of Atheists should feel. You say that you agree that the country should be as religious as it wants to be but then your always here stifling their expression and prayer with insults to their intelligence. It is if you are on a mission to dominate them into submission into believing that God should not be a part of the government. But the people are the government. What they believe and their morality is inside all legislation. Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. - bill b right - not - bill of rights - just - wrong - no fear here. - LegionSon - You have no idea what you're talking about, nor do you have any idea how many people you just ticked off. Those who prefer to be free from religion have precisely... precisely... the same amount of right to be in this country as those who prefer to delude themselves with various mythologies. As for the contributions from the deluded godly, the only thing they contributed to the process of making the Constitution were to slow and confuse the process. Transcriptional detail of the meetings during the construction of the Constitution pointed to a very Taliban-like insistence by the religious to include God in the tract. But... cooler heads prevailed, and we, intelligently, wound up with a neutral government. Yet here we are... two hundred thirty-three years later still listening to the irrational blatherings of preacher-wannabees trying to throw away that very valuable neutrality. And it's still paranoia that's doing it. Why do you people hate absolutely everybody? What, exactly, do you lose if atheists exist in your country?",

You say that you agree that the country should be as religious as it wants to be but then your always here stifling their expression and prayer with insults to their intelligence.

Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government.

Would you like Muslims deciding what to pray in school? Of course not. That's why the government can't favor one practice of conscience over another... plain and simple. It must always strive to be neutral. You want to get all flag-wavy and say what a wonderful thing our country is: this is the reason.

If you take a glimpse into the mirror or better yet back at all your clamorring posts of discontent toward religion while dominating these threads you will see paranoia. And then ask yourself why do you fear God while I celebrate Him. I am just establishing a foundation for a remedy. I am happy to see you speak of what I also believe the sensible conclusions the majority of Atheists should feel. You say that you agree that the country should be as religious as it wants to be but then your always here stifling their expression and prayer with insults to their intelligence. It is if you are on a mission to dominate them into submission into believing that God should not be a part of the government. But the people are the government. What they believe and their morality is inside all legislation. Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. - bill b right - not - bill of rights - just - wrong - no fear here. - LegionSon - You have no idea what you're talking about, nor do you have any idea how many people you just ticked off. Those who prefer to be free from religion have precisely... precisely... the same amount of right to be in this country as those who prefer to delude themselves with various mythologies. As for the contributions from the deluded godly, the only thing they contributed to the process of making the Constitution were to slow and confuse the process. Transcriptional detail of the meetings during the construction of the Constitution pointed to a very Taliban-like insistence by the religious to include God in the tract. But... cooler heads prevailed, and we, intelligently, wound up with a neutral government. Yet here we are... two hundred thirty-three years later still listening to the irrational blatherings of preacher-wannabees trying to throw away that very valuable neutrality. And it's still paranoia that's doing it. Why do you people hate absolutely everybody? What, exactly, do you lose if atheists exist in your country? Contrary to what you have said bill it is in reality you who have a hard time comprehending the subject or the intent of this thread. Maybe we are just having a misunderstanding in terminology. We are a country with \"freedom of religion\" where you can choose to believe in God or not through various faith structures. So then in contrast a country with \"freedom from religion\" would be a country with no religion allowed. Maybe you expect me to fall victim to your same understanding and usage of the terms that you have become comfortable with. But at least now you can understand where I stand on the subject.

Maybe you expect me to fall victim to your same understanding and usage of the terms that you have become comfortable with. But at least now you can understand where I stand on the subject. I won't head to the seemingly subtle difference. The language of our laws and the Constitution are based on \"freedom of religion\" not \"freedom from religion\". I see no need to change it or accept new terms. So, we do agree then that those who don't believe in God are welcome. I never said anything to the contrary. Also bill I don't know why you keep mentioning your preconceptions or irrational suspicions such as in this statement of yours ---> \"Why do you people hate absolutely everybody? What, exactly, do you lose if atheists exist in your country?\" Nowhere have I or any of the others you refer to as \"you people\" stated such horrible ideas. And you call me paranoid...could you possibly have a brain tumor? You constantly try to incorporate this idea where it does not apply. - geesh - - LegionSon - This thread has had a hidden agenda, which can be summarized by yourself quite eloquently. To wit: \"It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country.\" This is precisely the motivation for this thread; you want us out. Period. This inclination to prove that the churched have the upper hand, and therefore a greater say in who gets to be here and who doesn't is.. repeat.. IS paranoia. How could it be anything else? Why else would you care? I ask you why you hate everyone because that's how you come across. You hate atheists. You hate gays. You hate Muslims.... You're just to chicken to say it outright, so you point it out with your little innuendo about their non-right to a place in YOUR society. There IS a place in this country that is free FROM religion. That's the government, and it must always be. It's a place of the people, by the people, and for the people... no gods allowed.", 
        "reply": " Totally wrong again billy. My words say what I intended them to say. Anyone that rereads this thread will see that I have on several occasions reinforced my true intent and understanding toward all Americans. I am concerned that you continue to reveal your clinical signs of paranoia. You keep mentioning your \"preconceptions or irrational suspicions\" such as in this statement of yours ---> \"Why do you people hate absolutely everybody? What, exactly, do you lose if atheists exist in your country?\" Nowhere have I or any of the others you refer to as \"you people\" stated such horrible ideas. And you call me paranoid...could you possibly have a brain tumor? You constantly try to incorporate this idea where it does not apply. And now I think you should talk to someone about all these \"hidden agendas\" you see. Oooooo it does sound scarey I admit. It's going to be okay billy...for over 2 hundred years now it has been okay. hehh, Get a life man...and stop trying to change the words to the Constitution to suit your beliefs. and remember ...Let's take it one step at a time...The Declaration Of Independence Second section...\"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Tell me who is this \"Creator\" that created all men? Why did they Capitalize the \"C\" in \"Creator\" but not in the verb \"created\"? Answer: Because they recognized the importance of The Creator/God in considering the framework of this government. They also wanted to live by this same quote which included \"all men\" whether they believed in their Creator/God or not. They wanted to ensure a peaceful nation could survive itself from itself. And this thread is more focused specifically on God than any specific religion. It is about freedom of religion not freedom from religion. Anyone that wants freedom from religion is in the wrong country. The founders chose the words carefully bill. We are a country with \"freedom of religion\" where you can choose to believe in God or not through various faith structures. So then in contrast a country with \"freedom from religion\" would be a country with no religion allowed. Maybe you expect me to fall victim to your same understanding and usage of the terms that you have become comfortable with. But at least now you can understand where I stand on the subject.

Hey KJ1110...you bring up a great perspective of the importance of the word \"their\"...one that I would agree with. The mere fact that \"all men were created equal\"... \"with certain unalienable rights\" does not destinguish any preference over their individual belief structure either. Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness is the rights to \"all men\". These were and I believe still are recognized as God given rights from \"their Creator\".
