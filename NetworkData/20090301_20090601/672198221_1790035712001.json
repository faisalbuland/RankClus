Although Bush didnt get the cooperation he expected at the beginning of his term he at least showed Putin he wouldnt back down from his ideas even though it cost him dearly in matters of terrorism assistance and cooperation on major fronts. I still believe Bush is a decent man who had bad folks around him and his stubborness when confronted by mistakes hurt his presidency immensely. To me he made countless mistakes constantly. Obama, OTOH, doesnt have a clue and will get outflanked by Medvedev and Putin over and over again. FF, you can't be serious. Saakashvilli is so Bush's baby, actually more like a pet project. They helped get this happy idiot in power, gave him a cute little army, blew his ego the size of big ballon, and told him he can't join Nato till he fixes his problem with breakaway problem. The man could have bought every Ossetian in South Ossetia, if the money went to that, vice dumping it in the military. What was that mentally unstable person, Georgians have to call a president, supposed to do? He started solving his internal problems the best he knew. American ears are seen like miles away in that little adventure, and it happened when Obama was not in the office. And don't worry about mr. Obama's being outflanked by Putin and Medvedev. They know what they are doing. It's time out time. Remember, most damage was done to Russia during Clinton's time. This time should be particular interesting, because we don't have Elcin on a watch, but rather paranoid pair, that know exactly what America's intentions are. And Americans know, that they know. It's going to be interesting to watch.",

Quite right, and one has to ask why Lincohn didn't stop and ask permission of England and France to put the Union back together. I'd be curious to know how Sakashvili atarted \"this?\" This started quite a while ago when Russia set up these \"Republics\" (sic) in the first place. There you go again not understanding history. S. Ossetia and Abkhazia both fought for and won independence after the breakup of the USSR.

And he did the right thing, even though Sakashvili was morally and legally right. Reality intrudes it's ugly head, and then and there was not the time to start a World War.
