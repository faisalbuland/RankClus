Baitullah Mehsud, who has a US$5 million bounty on his head from the United States, said Monday's attack on the outskirts of the eastern city of Lahore was retaliation for U.S. missile strikes against militants along the Afghan border. \"Soon we will launch an attack in Washington that will amaze everyone in the world,\" Mehsud told The Associated Press by phone.

Baitullah Mehsud, who has a US$5 million bounty on his head from the United States, said Monday's attack on the outskirts of the eastern city of Lahore was retaliation for U.S. missile strikes against militants along the Afghan border. \"Soon we will launch an attack in Washington that will amaze everyone in the world,\" Mehsud told The Associated Press by phone. He provided no details. In his latest comments, Mehsud identified the White House as one of the targets in an interview with local Dewa Radio, a copy of which was obtained by the AP. Mehsud has never been directly linked to any attacks outside Pakistan, but attacks blamed on his network of fighters have widened in scope and ambition in recent years. The threat comes days after U.S. President Barack Obama warned that al-Qaida is actively planning attacks on the United States from secret havens in Pakistan. Pakistan's former government and the CIA named Mehsud as the prime suspect behind the December 2007 killing of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Pakistani officials accuse him of harbouring foreign fighters, including Central Asians linked to al-Qaida, and of training suicide bombers. (...)

        "quote": "Pakistani Taliban threatens White House attack that will 'amaze everyone' Tue Mar 31, 2:53 PM By Ishtiaq Mahsud, The Associated Press DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan - The commander of the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility Tuesday for a deadly assault on a Pakistani police academy and said the group was planning a terrorist attack on the White House that would \"amaze\" the world. Baitullah Mehsud, who has a US$5 million bounty on his head from the United States, said Monday's attack on the outskirts of the eastern city of Lahore was retaliation for U.S. missile strikes against militants along the Afghan border. \"Soon we will launch an attack in Washington that will amaze everyone in the world,\" Mehsud told The Associated Press by phone. He provided no details. In his latest comments, Mehsud identified the White House as one of the targets in an interview with local Dewa Radio, a copy of which was obtained by the AP. Mehsud has never been directly linked to any attacks outside Pakistan, but attacks blamed on his network of fighters have widened in scope and ambition in recent years. The threat comes days after U.S. President Barack Obama warned that al-Qaida is actively planning attacks on the United States from secret havens in Pakistan. Pakistan's former government and the CIA named Mehsud as the prime suspect behind the December 2007 killing of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Pakistani officials accuse him of harbouring foreign fighters, including Central Asians linked to al-Qaida, and of training suicide bombers. (...)
