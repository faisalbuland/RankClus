Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., a member of the House Armed Services Committee, had been talking since the November presidential elections about working to fulfill President Barack Obama\u2019s goal of lifting the military\u2019s ban on open service by gays and repealing the so-called \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy that allows military service by gays and lesbians under narrow restrictions. Tauscher introduced her policy bill March 3 and has collected 134 cosponsors. That is a sizeable number in such a short time, but it falls well short of the 218 votes needed to get a bill approved by the House. The bill, called the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, would prohibit the Defense Department and Coast Guard from discriminating against any potential recruit or a current member on the basis of sexual orientation. It also would allow anyone separated for homosexuality, bisexuality or homosexual conduct to rejoin the military. In a letter to constituents, Tauscher said she has been offered and accepted the opportunity to serve at the State Department as undersecretary for arms control and international security. \u201cKeeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists, making sure other countries do not obtain them and, one day, I hope, ridding the world of these terrible weapons, has become my passion and, I hope, my life\u2019s work.\u201d She made the announcement before being formally nominated by President Obama. In her letter, she acknowledges the State Department job is no sure thing. \u201cThe confirmation process for senior posts in government in fraught with uncertainty and can take weeks, if not months,\u201d she said. If she leaves Congress, this would be the second time that the lawmaker positioned to lead the fight to change the military\u2019s ban on service by gays departed to take another job. Before Tauscher, Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., had been a long-time sponsor of legislation to allow gays to openly serve in the military. Meehan resigned his seat in the House of Representatives in July 2007 to become chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. If Tauscher leaves, others could become the chief sponsor and advocate for attempting to change the military\u2019s policy. One supporter of the legislation is Rep. Susan Davis, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on military personnel, which has primary jurisdiction over personnel policy issues. The Navy Times",
