Kennedy There are no constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect. Ronald Reagan Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. John F. Kennedy The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help. Ronald Reagan Hopefully the President will take heed in these word. Especially the following: Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future. John F. Kennedy I cannot swallow whole the view of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator. Barack Obama And who was the president responsible for ending slavery in America Mr. Obama? Lincoln was, by the way, much more elequent than our current president.
