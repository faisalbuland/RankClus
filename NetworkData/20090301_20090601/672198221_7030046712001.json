Muntazer al-Zaidi, 30, said: \u201cLong live Iraq\u201d as the guilty verdict was read out in a Baghdad courtroom before being led away. The punishment prompted an angry reaction from family and friends who described it as harsh and politically motivated. Al-Zaidi\u2019s defence team plans to launch an appeal. The journalist captured headlines across the world when he flung his shoes at the then-US President during a press conference in Baghdad last December. This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people, dog! This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq,\u201d the reporter, from Al-Baghdadiya television, shouted before being bundled to the ground. Al-Zaidi, who has been held in detention since December 14, denies any wrong-doing. Wearing a light-brown suit, brown sweatshirt and thin-framed glasses, he stood confidently inside a wooden pen at the Iraq Central Criminal Court after being brought in under a heavy police escort. Asked by Presiding Judge Abdul-Amir al-Rubaie whether he was innocent or guilty, the defendant said: \u201cI am innocent. What I did was a natural response to the occupation.\u201d Some 200 people, including family members, lawyers and journalists, packed the courtroom to listen to the second day of the trial, which had been adjourned since February 19 for the three judges to weigh a defence argument that the charge was inapplicable because Mr Bush had not been in Baghdad as an official guest. Judge Al-Rubaie, however, read a response from the Prime Minister's office today insisting that the trip had been official despite being unannounced. Most people were sent out of the courtroom while the verdict and sentence were delivered. The three-year prison term is lower than the 5-to-15 years carried by the assault charge because the judge took into consideration al-Zaidi\u2019s young age and the fact that it was a first offence. This did little to pacify his family. Upon hearing the outcome, one sister, Ruqaiya, burst into tears. \"Down with (Iraqi Prime Minister) Maliki, agent of the Americans,\" she said outside the courtroom. Several other family members shouted anti-American slogans and tried to surge back inside. They were pushed away by police. Dhiaa al-Saadi, the chief defence lawyer, said that his team would appeal. \u201cThis sentence is harsh and is not in harmony with the law, and eventually the defence team will contest this in the appeals court,\" he said.

Muntazer al-Zaidi, 30, said: \u201cLong live Iraq\u201d as the guilty verdict was read out in a Baghdad courtroom before being led away. The punishment prompted an angry reaction from family and friends who described it as harsh and politically motivated. Al-Zaidi\u2019s defence team plans to launch an appeal. The journalist captured headlines across the world when he flung his shoes at the then-US President during a press conference in Baghdad last December. This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people, dog! This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq,\u201d the reporter, from Al-Baghdadiya television, shouted before being bundled to the ground. Al-Zaidi, who has been held in detention since December 14, denies any wrong-doing. Wearing a light-brown suit, brown sweatshirt and thin-framed glasses, he stood confidently inside a wooden pen at the Iraq Central Criminal Court after being brought in under a heavy police escort. Asked by Presiding Judge Abdul-Amir al-Rubaie whether he was innocent or guilty, the defendant said: \u201cI am innocent. What I did was a natural response to the occupation.\u201d Some 200 people, including family members, lawyers and journalists, packed the courtroom to listen to the second day of the trial, which had been adjourned since February 19 for the three judges to weigh a defence argument that the charge was inapplicable because Mr Bush had not been in Baghdad as an official guest. Judge Al-Rubaie, however, read a response from the Prime Minister's office today insisting that the trip had been official despite being unannounced. Most people were sent out of the courtroom while the verdict and sentence were delivered. The three-year prison term is lower than the 5-to-15 years carried by the assault charge because the judge took into consideration al-Zaidi\u2019s young age and the fact that it was a first offence. This did little to pacify his family. Upon hearing the outcome, one sister, Ruqaiya, burst into tears. \"Down with (Iraqi Prime Minister) Maliki, agent of the Americans,\" she said outside the courtroom. Several other family members shouted anti-American slogans and tried to surge back inside. They were pushed away by police. Dhiaa al-Saadi, the chief defence lawyer, said that his team would appeal. \u201cThis sentence is harsh and is not in harmony with the law, and eventually the defence team will contest this in the appeals court,\" he said.
