New evidence, from US sources, suggested to the court that the hotel, a base for foreign journalists, may have appeared on a list of US Military targets and perhaps was deliberately targetted. Initial US army response to the incident included a claim of firing from the hotel, and a warning to 'non-embedded' journalists. An Army investigation cleared the tank crew of wrongdoing and a Spanish court had previously declared there wasn't enough evidence to proceed. That has changed. A conviction in the Spanish court could be enforcible in any European nation, or country adhering to the World Court declaration, such as Canada. This message has been edited.

Today, the United States and its allies will never face a lone enemy on the battlefield. There will always be a hostile third party in the fight, but one which we not only refrain from attacking but are hesitant to annoy: the media. While this brief essay cannot undertake to analyze the psychological dysfunctions that lead many among the most privileged Westerners to attack their own civilization and those who defend it, we can acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that, to most media practitioners, our troops are always guilty (even if proven innocent), while our barbaric enemies are innocent (even if proven guilty). The phenomenon of Western and world journalists championing the \u201crights\u201d and causes of blood-drenched butchers who, given the opportunity, would torture and slaughter them, disproves the notion\u2014were any additional proof required\u2014that human beings are rational creatures. Indeed, the passionate belief of so much of the intelligentsia that our civilization is evil and only the savage is noble looks rather like an anemic version of the self-delusions of the terrorists themselves. And, of course, there is a penalty for the intellectual\u2019s dismissal of religion: humans need to believe in something greater than themselves, even if they have a degree from Harvard. Rejecting the god of their fathers, the neo-pagans who dominate the media serve as lackeys at the terrorists\u2019 bloody altar. Of course, the media have shaped the outcome of conflicts for centuries, from the European wars of religion through Vietnam. More recently, though, the media have determined the outcomes of conflicts. While journalists and editors ultimately failed to defeat the U.S. government in Iraq, video cameras and biased reporting guaranteed that Hezbollah would survive the 2006 war with Israel and, as of this writing, they appear to have saved Hamas from destruction in Gaza. Pretending to be impartial, the self-segregating personalities drawn to media careers overwhelmingly take a side, and that side is rarely ours. Although it seems unthinkable now, future wars may require censorship, news blackouts and, ultimately, military attacks on the partisan media. Perceiving themselves as superior beings, journalists have positioned themselves as protected-species combatants. But freedom of the press stops when its abuse kills our soldiers and strengthens our enemies. Such a view arouses disdain today, but a media establishment that has forgotten any sense of sober patriotism may find that it has become tomorrow\u2019s conventional wisdom. The point of all this is simple: Win. In warfare, nothing else matters. If you cannot win clean, win dirty. But win. Our victories are ultimately in humanity\u2019s interests, while our failures nourish monsters.\" Excerpted from 'Wishful Thinking and Indecisive Wars' an opinion piece written for the Journal of International Security.",
