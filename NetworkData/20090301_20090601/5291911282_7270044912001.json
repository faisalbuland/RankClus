I'm among freinds & I know this won't go any further so here goes... A while back I was laying in bed & dosed off. I woke up feeling super groggy & disorientated. My arm had fallen asleep(hardly ever happens, but it's a creepy feeling). While still in between being asleep & awake I realised I couldn't move my arm. I rolled over onto my back(was sleeping on my right side) & with my left hand reached over & picked up my right arm. I let it go & the dead weight of my arm landed square on my face! I was wearing my glasses & this sent my glasses askew. I yelled out(not comprehending what had happened)!! I was still feeling super groggy & repeated the same action(I guess I wanted to see if it would happen again). Again the arm came down smacking me in the face. This time I snapped to realising what was happening. Basicly I woke up to the fact that I was beating the crap out of myself!! The worse part was my wife was watching TV next to me. She stopped watching the TV & just watched me(I guess I was much more entertaining). For the next week or two she would ocassionaly do a repeat performance of my stupidity & die laughing. I couldn't get mad at her, cause I would do the same. OK, what silly things have you folks done??? Remember, its OK, your amongst freinds!",
