India's a great source for 'intel'. And they do all sorts of programming for the US market. They wouldn't dream of slipping little somethings into the machine code? Not at all, they're pals. Wake up, even an 'ally' like Israel has been caught spying. Software 'bugs' are more prevalent, more problematic than the hardware variety and harder to do something about. You know Chinese stuff should be handled with care. So should any off-shore materials used in a vital area.",
