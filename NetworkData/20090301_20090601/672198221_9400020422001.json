Most former presidents and (vice presidents at the moment) don't 'go quietly'. No, they yap and carry on and get their beaks into all sorts of stuff. They hate that their power is over. But not GW. He seems genuinely happy to be a regular citizen again. So the question remains; did he ever truly, deep down, want the CINC job in the first place? It's a valid question. -",
