        "content": "BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 12 ? American officials said today that four men arrested in connection with the killing of two American civilians working for the American occupation authority were apparently members of the new 70,000-member American-trained Iraqi police force... ...A fifth man seized in the killings was a former member of the police force under Saddam Hussein, an American spokesman said, while the sixth man was described as a civilian. The killings occurred on a road near the Shiite holy city of Karbala on Tuesday, when gunmen pursued the Americans and their Iraqi interpreter and raked them with automatic rifle fire. The slayings have shocked the Americans here, who now face the possibility that the men to whom they turn for cooperation in fighting the insurgency may include insurgent infiltrators or those paid to do their work. When the killings were first reported, officials said the killers were rebels disguised as policemen, but they said Friday that four of the arrested men had current and valid documents identifying them as policemen. At a news conference in Baghdad, American officials identified one of the victims as Fern L. Holland, 33, of Tulsa, Okla., a Washington lawyer who was in Iraq to lead classes in democracy and women's rights. Her American companion was identified as Robert J. Zangis, 44, of Prince William County, Va., a computer software salesman and former Marine Corps helicopter pilot who fought in Iraq last year as a reservist, then returned here to work with Iraqi newspapers and broadcasting outlets on issues of press freedom. The two were the first civilians working for the Coalition Provisional Authority to be killed in the insurgency that has been fighting a 130,000-member American force for much of the last year.
