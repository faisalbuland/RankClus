To proof just that i uploaded a video on youtube HOT LINK REMOVED where I in the beginning show you a binural brainwave of my own so you know what to look for, then i give a couple of examples where the ZG binural brainwave signal is implemented. Hope this is of any use for those investigating. I want to remark that binural brainwaves are very efficient (upto 95% of people respond to it), this makes it a very powerfull weapon if used as they do in ZG. Good luck and Regards.
