Also, tortured confessions frequently generate massive amounts of false information, leading to endless and costly false leads, and in turn, to a round robin of further interrogations of those wrongly identified.

Also, tortured confessions frequently generate massive amounts of false information, leading to endless and costly false leads, and in turn, to a round robin of further interrogations of those wrongly identified. But it is wrong to engage in the discussion whether torture is effective policy. The absolute prohibition on torture is not based on a consensus that it never works. Rather, it is based on the sad realization that the impulse to torture is ever-present; that human beings who are frightened or zealous or full of rage -- as human beings invariably are -- will feel a powerful need to torture and a powerful justification for acting on that need. It is useful to recall the understandable fear and anger after September 11 not to justify or excuse torture, but to understand that it is precisely at the moment of most stress that the norm against torture must be powerfully affirmed.",

BUT, were it my child, I do not believe that I could just say that they are probably already dead, so it just doesn't matter. Were it to come out later that he was telling the truth, THAT would be hard to live with. And this is not about torture as a policy instrument.... this is about just how deeply do people hold their convictions.... and would their beliefs still ring true if it were their own child's life in the balance. \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",

Hopefully I did not just offend your delicate sensitivities. If so, What I would want is good, solid, legal interrogation and good, solid, legal investigation to find my child. That way, when it is discovered that this perp was like most crooks (i.e. stupid and leaves tracks that can be exploited by good police work) and my child is found because of criminal stupidity and good, solid, legal police work, .... and you will wait how many days? 1.... 2..... 3..... at this point, if the case has not been cracked, and your child is truly without food and water, the point is moot, because the child is most likely dead. I'll have to admit, the Constitutional rights of the perp were preserved. I personally would not take much comfort in that if it were later proven that my child did in fact die slowly waiting for me to come get them. I heard a speaker once who spoke on his daughter being abducted, and eventually raped and killed. Something he said then, probably 10+ years ago still rings in my head whenever I hear of any situation such as this. He said, \"One of the first images in my head each morning, and one of the last at night, is of my Daughter... terrified and in pain, crying wondering why her daddy doesn't come and take her away.\" He's a better man than I.... since I do not know if I could live with that in my head. I'll have my child and the perp will be going to jail because his Constitutional rights were not violated by torturing him, which would result in the whole case being thrown out, buh-bye, do not go to jail, go abduct rape and kill another child because it was so important for me to toss the Constitution in the garbage to get what I want, and to hell with society and the greater good because of my short sighted needs. To me, the welfare of my child would not be a short sighted need. If you are large enough that you could step back in a situation like this and take that viewpoint, I applaud you. I could not. So, no...no torture. ... and then you would live with your decision, as I would live with mine.... I do not really know what I would do in that situation, and I hope that I, nor anyone here ever has to go there. \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",
