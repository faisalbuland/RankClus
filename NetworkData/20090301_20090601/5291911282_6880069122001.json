Would there be an issue with me going to the hospital for semi regular STD checks? I went about 6months ago and I would like to get checked again. now... i know to use protection and I'm very good about doing so but I've always heard that you should get checked up whenever/if ever you switch partners. And it just seems like good, safe practice to do so. I'm just wondering if I could get in trouble with it being on my records so much. I don't want to give the impression that I'm careless with my health or anything. Any kind of information you could give me would be great. Thanks",

Frankly, who cares how many times it's in your medical records? Not every other person gets access to your records, you know, and though medical info gets leaked like rainwater in both military and civilian systems, it IS protected and private information.
