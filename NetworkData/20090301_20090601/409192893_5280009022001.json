        "content": "Wtkk.com: When the Washington Post's Howard Kurtz reported that the Boston Globe-Democrat hadn't run a single story on the national \"Boston Tea Party\" movement (key word: Boston), I'll admit I was surprised. Their blatant political bias is obvious, and every rational reader knows their \"news\" coverage is driven by their politics. But not one story? From a journalistic standpoint, it's utterly indefensible. So I shouldn't have been surprised when I picked up the BG-D this morning--the day after thousands of BOSTON-are citizens gathered at BOSTON Harbor for a BOSTON Tea Party to protest (in part) the taxpayer abuse by our BOSTON-based state government...and found a single local story in the BOSTON paper. Buried on page A16 there was a small AP story with the dateline \"Frankfort, KY.\" I guess the Boston Globe-Democrat staff just couldn't resist a \"KY\" reference... To add ignorance to incompetence, the AP story spreads the canard that our Tea Party was part of some national Republican effort. They link it to FreedomWorks and the GOP--neither of whom had anything to do whatsoever with our event...though I'd be happy to send them the invoice for our expenses. Here's the Boston Globe-Democrat's model for journalistic success: Ignore a national story inspired by local Boston history for as long as possible; Refuse to cover the story when it becomes local; Misreport the story with a wire report from Kentucky; Then wonder why you're losing $1 million a week.",
