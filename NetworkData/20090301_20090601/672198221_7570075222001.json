After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality.

The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture. I gave my fellow americans the benefit of the doubt, my bad.", 
        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

It could be heights for another...but only duty for a paratrooper... Same as above....only a prisoner may be led to believe he or she will be ejected without the benefit of a parachute. It could be...being brought close to death for many...but certainly not for terrorists... They deal in death, terror and perceived chaos... What has the above got to do with torture? We are not talking about what an enemy can, will and does do! We are talking about our standards, our moral code, our agreement and signature to international treaties on torture, our own laws enacted pertaining to torture...it's not about the other guy. This being said, it is up to this society to decide where the line WILL be drawn...given the circumstances prevailing in these times. These so called 'times' are no different than any other era throughout history. We held people accountable for atrocities commited during WW 2. We executed war criminals of WW 2 for waterboarding (among other forms of torture inflicted) our troops and others who were prisoners. Threat of drowning vs. beheading and/or certain death by gunshot...let the PEOPLE decide... There is nothing to decide as those decisions have already been made by others. Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents...", 
        "reply": " Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime.

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture.

        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around?

S/F Gordon \"Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture.\" I wish I was that smart...it seems relative to one's experiences... What a croc! What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual. Being a prisoner is an entirely different situation, as your every move is controlled. And true isolation can be a form of torture. Perhaps you should read the Israeli studies on the subject.

You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon \"Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture.\" I wish I was that smart...it seems relative to one's experiences... What a croc! What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual. Being a prisoner is an entirely different situation, as your every move is controlled. And true isolation can be a form of torture. Perhaps you should read the Israeli studies on the subject.

That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised.

You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture.

Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable.

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave",

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave",

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture. I gave my fellow americans the benefit of the doubt, my bad.", 
        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up.

        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual. Being a prisoner is an entirely different situation, as your every move is controlled. And true isolation can be a form of torture. Perhaps you should read the Israeli studies on the subject. Within seven to ten days of true isolation, humans begin to demonstrate signs of paranoia, delusions, delusional thoughts. Remove food and water and the time to reach such a point is reduced. It could be heights for another...but only duty for a paratrooper... Same as above....only a prisoner may be led to believe he or she will be ejected without the benefit of a parachute. It could be...being brought close to death for many...but certainly not for terrorists... They deal in death, terror and perceived chaos... What has the above got to do with torture? We are not talking about what an enemy can, will and does do! We are talking about our standards, our moral code, our agreement and signature to international treaties on torture, our own laws enacted pertaining to torture...it's not about the other guy. This being said, it is up to this society to decide where the line WILL be drawn...given the circumstances prevailing in these times. These so called 'times' are no different than any other era throughout history. We held people accountable for atrocities commited during WW 2. We executed war criminals of WW 2 for waterboarding (among other forms of torture inflicted) our troops and others who were prisoners. Threat of drowning vs. beheading and/or certain death by gunshot...let the PEOPLE decide... There is nothing to decide as those decisions have already been made by others. Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents... Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture. Bottom line, maybe we should discontinue issuing Geneva Convention cards to our troops? After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon \"Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture.\" I wish I was that smart...it seems relative to one's experiences... What a croc! What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual. Being a prisoner is an entirely different situation, as your every move is controlled. And true isolation can be a form of torture. Perhaps you should read the Israeli studies on the subject. Within seven to ten days of true isolation, humans begin to demonstrate signs of paranoia, delusions, delusional thoughts. Remove food and water and the time to reach such a point is reduced. It could be heights for another...but only duty for a paratrooper... Same as above....only a prisoner may be led to believe he or she will be ejected without the benefit of a parachute. It could be...being brought close to death for many...but certainly not for terrorists... They deal in death, terror and perceived chaos... What has the above got to do with torture? We are not talking about what an enemy can, will and does do! We are talking about our standards, our moral code, our agreement and signature to international treaties on torture, our own laws enacted pertaining to torture...it's not about the other guy. This being said, it is up to this society to decide where the line WILL be drawn...given the circumstances prevailing in these times. These so called 'times' are no different than any other era throughout history. We held people accountable for atrocities commited during WW 2. We executed war criminals of WW 2 for waterboarding (among other forms of torture inflicted) our troops and others who were prisoners. Threat of drowning vs. beheading and/or certain death by gunshot...let the PEOPLE decide... There is nothing to decide as those decisions have already been made by others. Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents...", 
        "reply": " Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture.

What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual. Being a prisoner is an entirely different situation, as your every move is controlled. And true isolation can be a form of torture. Perhaps you should read the Israeli studies on the subject. Within seven to ten days of true isolation, humans begin to demonstrate signs of paranoia, delusions, delusional thoughts. Remove food and water and the time to reach such a point is reduced. It could be heights for another...but only duty for a paratrooper... Same as above....only a prisoner may be led to believe he or she will be ejected without the benefit of a parachute. It could be...being brought close to death for many...but certainly not for terrorists... They deal in death, terror and perceived chaos... What has the above got to do with torture? We are not talking about what an enemy can, will and does do! We are talking about our standards, our moral code, our agreement and signature to international treaties on torture, our own laws enacted pertaining to torture...it's not about the other guy. This being said, it is up to this society to decide where the line WILL be drawn...given the circumstances prevailing in these times. These so called 'times' are no different than any other era throughout history. We held people accountable for atrocities commited during WW 2. We executed war criminals of WW 2 for waterboarding (among other forms of torture inflicted) our troops and others who were prisoners. Threat of drowning vs. beheading and/or certain death by gunshot...let the PEOPLE decide... There is nothing to decide as those decisions have already been made by others. Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents... Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what?

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture.

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave",

After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave",

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture. I gave my fellow americans the benefit of the doubt, my bad.", 
        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual. Being a prisoner is an entirely different situation, as your every move is controlled. And true isolation can be a form of torture. Perhaps you should read the Israeli studies on the subject. Within seven to ten days of true isolation, humans begin to demonstrate signs of paranoia, delusions, delusional thoughts. Remove food and water and the time to reach such a point is reduced. It could be heights for another...but only duty for a paratrooper... Same as above....only a prisoner may be led to believe he or she will be ejected without the benefit of a parachute. It could be...being brought close to death for many...but certainly not for terrorists... They deal in death, terror and perceived chaos... What has the above got to do with torture? We are not talking about what an enemy can, will and does do! We are talking about our standards, our moral code, our agreement and signature to international treaties on torture, our own laws enacted pertaining to torture...it's not about the other guy. This being said, it is up to this society to decide where the line WILL be drawn...given the circumstances prevailing in these times. These so called 'times' are no different than any other era throughout history. We held people accountable for atrocities commited during WW 2. We executed war criminals of WW 2 for waterboarding (among other forms of torture inflicted) our troops and others who were prisoners. Threat of drowning vs. beheading and/or certain death by gunshot...let the PEOPLE decide... There is nothing to decide as those decisions have already been made by others. Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents... Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture.

After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon \"Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture.\" I wish I was that smart...it seems relative to one's experiences... What a croc! What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual. Being a prisoner is an entirely different situation, as your every move is controlled. And true isolation can be a form of torture. Perhaps you should read the Israeli studies on the subject. Within seven to ten days of true isolation, humans begin to demonstrate signs of paranoia, delusions, delusional thoughts. Remove food and water and the time to reach such a point is reduced. It could be heights for another...but only duty for a paratrooper... Same as above....only a prisoner may be led to believe he or she will be ejected without the benefit of a parachute. It could be...being brought close to death for many...but certainly not for terrorists... They deal in death, terror and perceived chaos... What has the above got to do with torture? We are not talking about what an enemy can, will and does do! We are talking about our standards, our moral code, our agreement and signature to international treaties on torture, our own laws enacted pertaining to torture...it's not about the other guy. This being said, it is up to this society to decide where the line WILL be drawn...given the circumstances prevailing in these times. These so called 'times' are no different than any other era throughout history. We held people accountable for atrocities commited during WW 2. We executed war criminals of WW 2 for waterboarding (among other forms of torture inflicted) our troops and others who were prisoners. Threat of drowning vs. beheading and/or certain death by gunshot...let the PEOPLE decide... There is nothing to decide as those decisions have already been made by others. Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents...",

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking.

In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up.

Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents... Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents... Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11.

The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave",

After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable.

The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs.

After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture. I gave my fellow americans the benefit of the doubt, my bad.", 
        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

It could be heights for another...but only duty for a paratrooper... Same as above....only a prisoner may be led to believe he or she will be ejected without the benefit of a parachute. It could be...being brought close to death for many...but certainly not for terrorists... They deal in death, terror and perceived chaos... What has the above got to do with torture? We are not talking about what an enemy can, will and does do! We are talking about our standards, our moral code, our agreement and signature to international treaties on torture, our own laws enacted pertaining to torture...it's not about the other guy. This being said, it is up to this society to decide where the line WILL be drawn...given the circumstances prevailing in these times. These so called 'times' are no different than any other era throughout history. We held people accountable for atrocities commited during WW 2. We executed war criminals of WW 2 for waterboarding (among other forms of torture inflicted) our troops and others who were prisoners. Threat of drowning vs. beheading and/or certain death by gunshot...let the PEOPLE decide... There is nothing to decide as those decisions have already been made by others. Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke? They are issued as they could be a form of protection but they are also issued to remind us, we have an obligation to defend and do no harm to prisoners under our control. Circumstances, nor the type of enemy have anything to do with our obligations. My personal two cents...", 
        "reply": " Well, that is about the value of your opinion based upon what was presented. You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime.

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture.

        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around?

S/F Gordon \"Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture.\" I wish I was that smart...it seems relative to one's experiences... What a croc! What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual.

Do you think the issuing of Geneva Convention cards to our members of the military are issued as a lark, a joke?

You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture. If you wish to look at America as a country that abandoned its moral compass because we are fighting an enemy without morality, more's the pity for us and our nation...its a step toward a failed society...study some world history...you will be surprised at what you learn.

S/F Gordon \"Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture.\" I wish I was that smart...it seems relative to one's experiences... What a croc! What do 'experience's' have to do with torture? If a person cannot tell right from wrong, they are deficient in the brain housing group. Only a psychopath or sociopath would not know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Torture could be isolation for one individual...but only duty for a submariner... What an absurd comparison! A submariner is a member of a crew, not isolated and there voluntarily. Isolation can be self-imposed, a choice by an individual.

You're welcome to ignore the relevant evidence and pertinent facts regarding America's domestic and international obligations that were formulated and agreed to regarding torture.

That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised.

That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible.

Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating.

Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable.

If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture.

S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top. The pedophiles who murder, the serial killer, the person caught in a crime where they tortured others. But no American leader ever embraced this kind of thinking. If the subject came up, it was not debated, no politician would ever dare to debate such a question. In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave",

That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised.

We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence.

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture. I gave my fellow americans the benefit of the doubt, my bad.", 
        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",

If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law!

In wars such as those with the Indians, who tortured people, or the modern wars of WWII, the question never came up. No political leader would dare to raise such questions. Instead when we compared ourselves to our enemies, it was always a point of honor to state that American does not torture, does not consider torture - That even the most heinous crime or the most barbaric enemy was treated by our standards of justice and morality. That America, neither to it's home made criminals, or international criminals, would ever sink to their level. In 2001 ourt leaders told us to be terrorised. They pointed to the \"mushroom cloud,\" the horror of 9/11. They told us that these were desperate times, that our countries very existance was in mortal danger in a way that had never before occured. And they implied that they would not be bound by these silly little moral lessons that our country placed such value on. To my mind we are debating the undebatable. We are using orwellian rhetoric in which torture is transformed into \"enhanced interogation.\" That this really isn't that bad, because there are worse things that can be dreamed up. And finally, we are being told that the Communist methods of torture, designed to get people to confess to war crimes, crimes that they could not and did not commit, are somehow in some magical way, are going to give us reliable actionable intelligence. Well, I would be lying if I claimed that these methods Never work. But their use, by their very nature, make the normal, reliable, time tested and proven, methods of interogation impossible. We are litterally cutting off our nose to spite our face. Provinding our enemies with all the propaganda they could possibly want; blurring the difference between us and them. And for what? Five percent success at the expense of eliminating the 95 percent success rate of normal methods? It's a bad SNL skit that we are debating. Dave I am pretty sure your intelligent rant is going to be lost on most here. We are the minority because we simply do not believe in torture.

Not only under US law but under international treaties the US has signed. One of the initial tasks the new United Nations undertook was the issue of torture. After witnessing the abuses by Germany and Japan, it was determined that no form of torture would be tolerated or condoned. The UN outlined (with the help of lawyers and legal beagals from the US, and some of whom participated in the post WW 2 war crimes trials) write and adopt the definition of torture. One merely had to go to those first documents from the UN...it is all outlined there. So this spliting of hairs regarding the definition on what constitutes torture is a smoke screen in an attempt to protect those who allowed, condoned, ordered and participated in torture. Even without guidelines, anyone with limited intelligence can recognize and define torture. Bottom line, maybe we should discontinue issuing Geneva Convention cards to our troops? After all, of what value are they now the US has condoned torture? S/F Gordon Through my entire life of 61 years, I've always encountered people who want us to torture those criminals whose acts are so horrendous as to be over the top.

        "reply": "Well, the line in the sand has been drawn and crossed. If no one is punished for their trangressions, the future for America will be one of some future president thinking...they crossed the line before with no ramifications. I know I can go at least as far as they did, and perhaps even further in the forms of torture utilized. The genie is out of the bottle and only an investigation, prosecution and punishment will deter future leaders from thinking they are above the law. I'm fairly confident, if you, me or anyone else on this board subjected someone to waterboarding feeling they had a good excuse to do so, the law would not care...we would be prosecuted. It is also my understanding, 30 to 40 internee's have died while in our custody? One has to wonder, how did they die? Amazing how video of torture sessions were destroyed...that in itself is a violation of federal law. Will anyone ever answer for this particular crime. Apparently they had something to hide and my guess is, we would probably witness people being tortured to death...and who want's that kind of evidence lying around? If the Obama administration does not appoint an independent investigator (hell, they spent millions investigating a BJ) he will be a failure as a president just on this point alone. For someone who is a Constitutional lawyer, claims to be a constitutionalist...he is demonstrating he will allow a certain class of people to actually be above the law! Shame on him if he is indeed just another politician lying to America...it is the last thing America needs. S/F Gordon _____________________________________________ ",
