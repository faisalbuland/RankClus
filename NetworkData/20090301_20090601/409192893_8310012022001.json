Since 2001, a majority of Americans has favored stricter gun laws. Though support has been trending slightly down. Eight years ago, 54 percent of Americans wanted stricter gun laws compared to 50 percent in 2007, according to a Gallup poll. And now? A sharp, sudden drop. Only 39 percent of Americans now favor stricter gun laws. Gun control should still be enforced, however, we need to expand concealed weapons rights, thats the key. Let qualified people carry weapons if they choose too. In california the Police Unions have ruined everyones right to carry weapons. They keep on crying about how they volunteered for a dangerous job",

I won't argue that some cops are real *******s - I know some of the cops where I grew up, and they could all point to the guys on the force who got into the business so they could beat up on people \"legally\".

Nothing about power in it - they just don't want to get shot.

They never know if that person is looking to take a shot at them. Make them nervous. One of the guys I knew (family friend, my old cubmaster from when I was a kid) was nearly killed by a homeowner - he was responding to a home invasion report, guy decided that the burgler had come back (apparently missing the flashing lights) and decided to shoot first and skip the questions.

If they commit a robbery with a gun then that should be treated in a manner in which that person does not see the light of day for a very long time.

It is to maintain a superior position vis-a-vis the rest of the population. It isn't about \"officer safety\", it's about control. Personally, I think any chief LEO that campaigns against gun rights should be stripped of his position on the spot. Unfortunately, in too many states, the citizens are more than willing to accept an oppressive police state in a misguided sense of safety. I won't argue that some cops are real *******s - I know some of the cops where I grew up, and they could all point to the guys on the force who got into the business so they could beat up on people \"legally\". Most of those guys gravitate to the night shift - more action, and drunks are less likely to fight back or press charges. But most of the rest don't like armed civilians either. Nothing about power in it - they just don't want to get shot. They never know if the guy with the 9mm is a drug dealer, a cult member, someone looking for \"suicide by cop\", or someone just trying to protect themself. They never know if that person is looking to take a shot at them. Make them nervous. One of the guys I knew (family friend, my old cubmaster from when I was a kid) was nearly killed by a homeowner - he was responding to a home invasion report, guy decided that the burgler had come back (apparently missing the flashing lights) and decided to shoot first and skip the questions. Luckily he was a bad shot. ______________________________________________- Unfortunate, but it isn't enough to violate a constitutional right because unfortunate things happen. The cops I know, when questioned about what they'd do, if they were ordered to confiscate citizen's firearms, answeres ranged from \"quit\" to saying they'd be too busy hiding their own guns to do anything. Too many cops have a real \"feel sorry for me cause I have a dangerous job\" attitude. Not the majority, but too many. When I'm working on a 500,000 volt line, not one cop has ever ask to trade professions when he saw that looooong electrical arc.",

I think your kidding on this, but the outlaws never turned them in anyway. All it boils down to is holding people accountable. If they commit a robbery with a gun then that should be treated in a manner in which that person does not see the light of day for a very long time. Not to mention cleaning up the joke of prison system we have, make it punishment like it should be.",
