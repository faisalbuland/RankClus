These same Soldiers by regulation if they have more than %70 in more than one area are not supposed to be transferred into a SELRES unit from the IRR. So why can't they discharge these fine Soldiers with honor, is it a numbers game for the Army to keep them on the books? Lets take care of our Finest who have served and not just use them for a numbers game. Give them the medical review prior to release. These Troops have given there all and have physical issues that would prevent many from deploying. Anyone out there that falls into this area? Kyle Premiumboxes",

They are generally kept on Active until they are given their rating, and then discharged, and tranferred to VA medical. I do know that IRR folks are not covered by military medical - no more than someone would be who was discharged completely if they had finished their Military Service Obligation at separation.
