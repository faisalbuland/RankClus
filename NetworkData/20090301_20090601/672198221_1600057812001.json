        "content": "The shortness of February notwithstanding, President Obama has now been in office for two months. During the election season, President Obama's popularity was based in large part upon a belief that his personal charisma, intelligence, and overall excellence would improve America's allegedly tarnished standing in the world. After eight years of the Bush Administration, the American electorate decided that it was time for America's domestic, economic, and foreign policies to shift in a new direction. Thus far, President Obama has made a great spectacle of reversing as many of President Bush's policies as possible, from a sleight of hand on the issue of stem cell research, to proposals for tax increases. With respect to foreign policy, what kind of progress has America made since Barack Obama was sworn in? Even the diplomatic front has proven difficult for the Obama Administration. First came a family-wide gaffe with the British Prime Minister and his wife, in which the First Lady presented gifts to Sarah Brown for the Brown boys that had almost certainly been purchased by a staffer at the White House gift shop, and President Obama presented Prime Minister Gordon Brown with a set of American movies on DVD that were not only a lackluster gift to the leader of America's closest ally, but that weren't even playable on a European DVD player. Alluding to another Obama Administration gaffe, independent journalist Michael Totten pointed out that maybe America needs a reset button for the United Kingdom. This referred, of course, to Secretary of State Clinton presenting a \"Reset\" button to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov \u2013 only, instead of reading \"Reset\" in Russian (which would have been coy), the translator had instead supplied the Russian translation for \"Overloaded\" or \"Overcharged\" (which was awkward). Although Lavrov was gracious about the mistake, and Sen. Clinton can not be personally blamed for the gaffe, this is yet another misstep by the Obama Administration when working on important foreign policy matters. And let's not even get into the teleprompter incident with Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowen. In point of fact, one would be hard pressed to conjure a single memory in the two month duration of the Obama Administration's diplomatic record that hasn't resulted in a noteworthy gaffe or misstep. The purpose of this article is not necessarily to lambaste President Obama, the First Lady, Secretary of State Clinton, or even Attorney General Holder. Its purpose is to point out that while President Obama is picking basketball brackets on ESPN, hanging out with Jay Leno, or going on vacation in Chicago, things are happening around the world that have a profound impact on the security and economic interests of the United States, America's current allies, and America's potential allies.
