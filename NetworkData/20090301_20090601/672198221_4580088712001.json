In the case of wall street it is really how they get paid. Most get paid little maybe less than 100 grand a year that gets taxed as \"ordinary income\" some get paid no \"salary\" and the rest however many 100's of grand or millions they call a \"bonus\" In a lot of ways it is a tax scam the roots of which lead back to the capitol gains rate being lowered to 15% I sort of works like this, you are a stock broker and you make a million bucks a year, now if that was all considered \"ordinary income\" you would pay income taxes on that at 30 whatever % 300 plus grand but first they call 900 grand or maybe the whole million a bonus and then as is most often the case pay it to you in the form of company stock. Basically in early Dec The compnay buys up how ever many million or billion worth of there own stock and gives it out to all these \"employees\" who promptly turn around and sell it, now here is where the scam comes in, the profit from the sale of that stock is considered by the IRS to be a \"captiol gain\" and since they lowered it capitol gains get taxed at 15% and it does not matter if that capitol gain is 1000 dollars, a million dollars or a billion dollars. Going back to to the example of the million dollar a year stock broker 15% vs soon to be 39% and the guy saves like 200 grand a year in taxes. up that to 10 or a 100 mil a year and you can see where this goes. If the capitol gains rate was the same as the rate for ordianry income and or was progressive like ordinary income tax you wouldn't see this. IMO this also has everything to do with this constant almost religious ferver the right and wall street types have about always wanting to \"lower the capitol gains rate\" a lot if they had there way would want to see it at 0% Wouldn't to be nice to be able to rig the system so you paid no or at least less tax? Well that is what they are trying to do. Back to the imediate point though, if they just said the were paying 100 million in salary which in effect they are doing and didn't label them, wrongly IMO as \"bonuses\" there would be no \"uproar\" about this.",

Basically in early Dec The compnay buys up how ever many million or billion worth of there own stock and gives it out to all these \"employees\" who promptly turn around and sell it, now here is where the scam comes in, the profit from the sale of that stock is considered by the IRS to be a \"captiol gain\" and since they lowered it capitol gains get taxed at 15% and it does not matter if that capitol gain is 1000 dollars, a million dollars or a billion dollars. Going back to to the example of the million dollar a year stock broker 15% vs soon to be 39% and the guy saves like 200 grand a year in taxes. up that to 10 or a 100 mil a year and you can see where this goes. If the capitol gains rate was the same as the rate for ordianry income and or was progressive like ordinary income tax you wouldn't see this. IMO this also has everything to do with this constant almost religious ferver the right and wall street types have about always wanting to \"lower the capitol gains rate\" a lot if they had there way would want to see it at 0% Wouldn't to be nice to be able to rig the system so you paid no or at least less tax? Well that is what they are trying to do. Back to the imediate point though, if they just said the were paying 100 million in salary which in effect they are doing and didn't label them, wrongly IMO as \"bonuses\" there would be no \"uproar\" about this.",

Back to the imediate point though, if they just said the were paying 100 million in salary which in effect they are doing and didn't label them, wrongly IMO as \"bonuses\" there would be no \"uproar\" about this.",

In the case of wall street it is really how they get paid. Most get paid little maybe less than 100 grand a year that gets taxed as \"ordinary income\" some get paid no \"salary\" and the rest however many 100's of grand or millions they call a \"bonus\" In a lot of ways it is a tax scam the roots of which lead back to the capitol gains rate being lowered to 15% I sort of works like this, you are a stock broker and you make a million bucks a year, now if that was all considered \"ordinary income\" you would pay income taxes on that at 30 whatever % 300 plus grand but first they call 900 grand or maybe the whole million a bonus and then as is most often the case pay it to you in the form of company stock. Basically in early Dec The compnay buys up how ever many million or billion worth of there own stock and gives it out to all these \"employees\" who promptly turn around and sell it, now here is where the scam comes in, the profit from the sale of that stock is considered by the IRS to be a \"captiol gain\" and since they lowered it capitol gains get taxed at 15% and it does not matter if that capitol gain is 1000 dollars, a million dollars or a billion dollars. Going back to to the example of the million dollar a year stock broker 15% vs soon to be 39% and the guy saves like 200 grand a year in taxes. up that to 10 or a 100 mil a year and you can see where this goes. If the capitol gains rate was the same as the rate for ordianry income and or was progressive like ordinary income tax you wouldn't see this. IMO this also has everything to do with this constant almost religious ferver the right and wall street types have about always wanting to \"lower the capitol gains rate\" a lot if they had there way would want to see it at 0% Wouldn't to be nice to be able to rig the system so you paid no or at least less tax? Well that is what they are trying to do. Back to the imediate point though, if they just said the were paying 100 million in salary which in effect they are doing and didn't label them, wrongly IMO as \"bonuses\" there would be no \"uproar\" about this.",

In the case of wall street it is really how they get paid. Most get paid little maybe less than 100 grand a year that gets taxed as \"ordinary income\" some get paid no \"salary\" and the rest however many 100's of grand or millions they call a \"bonus\" In a lot of ways it is a tax scam the roots of which lead back to the capitol gains rate being lowered to 15% I sort of works like this, you are a stock broker and you make a million bucks a year, now if that was all considered \"ordinary income\" you would pay income taxes on that at 30 whatever % 300 plus grand but first they call 900 grand or maybe the whole million a bonus and then as is most often the case pay it to you in the form of company stock. Basically in early Dec The compnay buys up how ever many million or billion worth of there own stock and gives it out to all these \"employees\" who promptly turn around and sell it, now here is where the scam comes in, the profit from the sale of that stock is considered by the IRS to be a \"captiol gain\" and since they lowered it capitol gains get taxed at 15% and it does not matter if that capitol gain is 1000 dollars, a million dollars or a billion dollars. Going back to to the example of the million dollar a year stock broker 15% vs soon to be 39% and the guy saves like 200 grand a year in taxes. up that to 10 or a 100 mil a year and you can see where this goes. If the capitol gains rate was the same as the rate for ordianry income and or was progressive like ordinary income tax you wouldn't see this. IMO this also has everything to do with this constant almost religious ferver the right and wall street types have about always wanting to \"lower the capitol gains rate\" a lot if they had there way would want to see it at 0% Wouldn't to be nice to be able to rig the system so you paid no or at least less tax? Well that is what they are trying to do.

In the case of wall street it is really how they get paid. Most get paid little maybe less than 100 grand a year that gets taxed as \"ordinary income\" some get paid no \"salary\" and the rest however many 100's of grand or millions they call a \"bonus\" In a lot of ways it is a tax scam the roots of which lead back to the capitol gains rate being lowered to 15% I sort of works like this, you are a stock broker and you make a million bucks a year, now if that was all considered \"ordinary income\" you would pay income taxes on that at 30 whatever % 300 plus grand but first they call 900 grand or maybe the whole million a bonus and then as is most often the case pay it to you in the form of company stock. Basically in early Dec The compnay buys up how ever many million or billion worth of there own stock and gives it out to all these \"employees\" who promptly turn around and sell it, now here is where the scam comes in, the profit from the sale of that stock is considered by the IRS to be a \"captiol gain\" and since they lowered it capitol gains get taxed at 15% and it does not matter if that capitol gain is 1000 dollars, a million dollars or a billion dollars. Going back to to the example of the million dollar a year stock broker 15% vs soon to be 39% and the guy saves like 200 grand a year in taxes. up that to 10 or a 100 mil a year and you can see where this goes. If the capitol gains rate was the same as the rate for ordianry income and or was progressive like ordinary income tax you wouldn't see this. IMO this also has everything to do with this constant almost religious ferver the right and wall street types have about always wanting to \"lower the capitol gains rate\" a lot if they had there way would want to see it at 0% Wouldn't to be nice to be able to rig the system so you paid no or at least less tax? Well that is what they are trying to do.
