Why would the Chinese Navy go to the expense of rehabilitating and sending to sea a carrier that was designed more than 40 years ago--and has never had her engines, controls, radars, and many other important features installed. The cost of producing and installing those compoients would probably be more than building a new carrier as those suppliers are mostly no longer in business (in Russia and the Ukraine), and if they are they no longer produce suitable systems for that particular design. Rather, the Chinese Navy has used the VARYAG as a schoolroom for naval architects interested in carrier design. As for the Chinese now building two 50-60,000 ton carriers--wrong again. Satellite photography (some of which is commercially available) of the two or three yards in China that could construct such ships show no activity that would indicate carrier programs are underway; similarly, the firms that could produce such items as aircraft elevators for carriers show no such projects on their order books.

But reports that they are now building them--and some \"unnamed sources\" tell of a 100,000-ton nuclear ship being constructed--are premature. With respect, Norman, A new shipyard capable of handling ships of this size, in excess of 50,000 tons displacement and 1,000 feet in length, looks to have been built on an island off Shanghai. Satellite imagery shows that there is much activity there but no keel has been laid although it seems preparations are being made to do just that. China has managed to keep a high level of secrecy building submarines and there is no reason to think that they cant pull off major component construction in a similar manner. We can agree that just being able to build an aircraft carrier in no way comes close to being able to effectively operate one well enough to be a credible threat to the USN but by the next decade they will be taking great pains to attempt to get into a combat capable mode. 2015 may be a bit premature but they will get it done. Also, I can confirm that nothing special is going on with the Varyag except with the possible name change but that doesnt mean anything either. What is interesting is that the J-11BS has been seen at CFTE last week which is the second domestically produced Flanker clone which is supposed to be a heavy, multi-role strike aircraft like the F-15E and supposedly the \"naval flanker\" variant J-11BJ is expected by 2010 so why would they be investing in Naval aircraft if they didnt plan on having an aircraft carrier by 2015 for the aircraft to be serial produced and ready by then? Additionally, if the stepped up production of the Yuan class sub is any indication(already 3rd boat nearing completion in less than 4 years)the Chinese may be able to pull off an ambitious carrier project in a similar speedy manner as well. I still wouldnt rule out using the Varyag as a testing/training ship.",

Again, China does want carriers and will undoubtedly build some in the future. But there are ample classified and open source indications that demonstrate conclusively that such a construction effort has not yet begun. Again, for a decade there have been reports that the VARYAG is \"being completed\" by China, yet absolutely no work on the ship has been observed (other than a decent paint job). For example, to install engines would require cutting upon the flight deck! The Chinese \"elevator companies\" that could build flight-deck lifts for future carriers are well known in the West, work with Western companies, and there would be indications if such work were being undertaken. Rather, expect to see Chinese observers aboard the new, Russian-buiult carrier when she becomes operational. Norman Norman",

        "reply": "All: Much, much easier to build submarines \"in secret\"--under cover, etc. Not possible to build a carrier \"indoors,\" not even in the giant covered building ways at Sverdovinsk and Komsomolsk, which Stalin had erected to build battleships side-by-side. Again, China does want carriers and will undoubtedly build some in the future. But there are ample classified and open source indications that demonstrate conclusively that such a construction effort has not yet begun. Again, for a decade there have been reports that the VARYAG is \"being completed\" by China, yet absolutely no work on the ship has been observed (other than a decent paint job). For example, to install engines would require cutting upon the flight deck! The Chinese \"elevator companies\" that could build flight-deck lifts for future carriers are well known in the West, work with Western companies, and there would be indications if such work were being undertaken. Rather, expect to see Chinese observers aboard the new, Russian-buiult carrier when she becomes operational. Norman Norman",

The Chinese Navy is a paper Tiger. I think both you and the article writer really underestimate the Chinese Navy, or the rest of the PLA for that matter. That same kind of complacency is what led the US military back then to underestimate the Japanese just before the Pacific War began, making them ill-prepared for a contingency like the Dec.7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbour. Here are a couple of earlier threads on both here and the US_China section of military.com to get you up to speed: \"Chinese Navy (PLAN) 60th Anniversary sees PRC showcase naval might\" thread of military.com \"PLAN Admiral vows to accelerate naval buildup\" thread of military.com \"Chinese Navy (PLAN) begins training carrier aviators\" thread of military.com \"China seriously considering carriers thread\" of military.com Furthermore, that formerly derelict ex-Soviet Russian carrier Varyag which was towed to Shanghai/Dalian to originally be a floating casino has since been put under government control and is now being refurbished to become a full operational carrier. The Varyag has been renamed Shi Lang/\u65bd\u7405, or the name of the Qing Dynasty general who helped conquer Taiwan from Ming rebels in the 1600s. How ironic, since the PRC/mainland China has vowed to one day retake Taiwan/the ROC, by force, if the Taipei government does not reunify with China peacefully. ++www.varyagworld.com And as started in one of the threads above, the PRC/China has also begun construction of two home-built carriers this year as well. quote: From the Asahi Shimbun newspaper of Japan: China to start construction of 1st aircraft carriers next year BY KENJI MINEMURA, THE ASAHI SHIMBUN BEIJING--China will begin construction of the country's first domestically produced aircraft carriers in Shanghai next year, with an eye to completing two mid-sized carriers by 2015, military and shipbuilding sources said. Beijing is also expected to complete work on a never-finished former Soviet aircraft carrier moored in the northeastern port of Dalian, to provide training for carrier-based pilots and crew. The two 50,000- to 60,000-ton carriers will rely on conventional propulsion systems, not nuclear power. They will be assigned to the People's Liberation Army Navy south sea fleet, tasked with patrolling the South China Sea, sources said...",

That same kind of complacency is what led the US military back then to underestimate the Japanese just before the Pacific War began, making them ill-prepared for a contingency like the Dec.7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbour. Here are a couple of earlier threads on both here and the US_China section of military.com to get you up to speed: \"Chinese Navy (PLAN) 60th Anniversary sees PRC showcase naval might\" thread of military.com \"PLAN Admiral vows to accelerate naval buildup\" thread of military.com \"Chinese Navy (PLAN) begins training carrier aviators\" thread of military.com \"China seriously considering carriers thread\" of military.com Furthermore, that formerly derelict ex-Soviet Russian carrier Varyag which was towed to Shanghai/Dalian to originally be a floating casino has since been put under government control and is now being refurbished to become a full operational carrier. The Varyag has been renamed Shi Lang/\u65bd\u7405, or the name of the Qing Dynasty general who helped conquer Taiwan from Ming rebels in the 1600s. How ironic, since the PRC/mainland China has vowed to one day retake Taiwan/the ROC, by force, if the Taipei government does not reunify with China peacefully. ++www.varyagworld.com And as started in one of the threads above, the PRC/China has also begun construction of two home-built carriers this year as well. quote: From the Asahi Shimbun newspaper of Japan: China to start construction of 1st aircraft carriers next year BY KENJI MINEMURA, THE ASAHI SHIMBUN BEIJING--China will begin construction of the country's first domestically produced aircraft carriers in Shanghai next year, with an eye to completing two mid-sized carriers by 2015, military and shipbuilding sources said. Beijing is also expected to complete work on a never-finished former Soviet aircraft carrier moored in the northeastern port of Dalian, to provide training for carrier-based pilots and crew. The two 50,000- to 60,000-ton carriers will rely on conventional propulsion systems, not nuclear power. They will be assigned to the People's Liberation Army Navy south sea fleet, tasked with patrolling the South China Sea, sources said...",

You are wrong again with respect to the Chinese Navy rehabilitating the unfinished Russian carrier VARYAG. She has been sitting at the same pier in Dalian for several years--she has been painted but no work has been done on her. The carrier is readily visible from a nearby commercial hotel. Why would the Chinese Navy go to the expense of rehabilitating and sending to sea a carrier that was designed more than 40 years ago--and has never had her engines, controls, radars, and many other important features installed. The cost of producing and installing those compoients would probably be more than building a new carrier as those suppliers are mostly no longer in business (in Russia and the Ukraine), and if they are they no longer produce suitable systems for that particular design. Rather, the Chinese Navy has used the VARYAG as a schoolroom for naval architects interested in carrier design. As for the Chinese now building two 50-60,000 ton carriers--wrong again. Satellite photography (some of which is commercially available) of the two or three yards in China that could construct such ships show no activity that would indicate carrier programs are underway; similarly, the firms that could produce such items as aircraft elevators for carriers show no such projects on their order books. It is difficult to build a carrier in secret. Could you share with us some of the \"sources\" that you quote? Yes, China will undoubtedly build aircraft carriers in the future.

But reports that they are now building them--and some \"unnamed sources\" tell of a 100,000-ton nuclear ship being constructed--are premature. With respect, Norman, A new shipyard capable of handling ships of this size, in excess of 50,000 tons displacement and 1,000 feet in length, looks to have been built on an island off Shanghai. Satellite imagery shows that there is much activity there but no keel has been laid although it seems preparations are being made to do just that. China has managed to keep a high level of secrecy building submarines and there is no reason to think that they cant pull off major component construction in a similar manner. We can agree that just being able to build an aircraft carrier in no way comes close to being able to effectively operate one well enough to be a credible threat to the USN but by the next decade they will be taking great pains to attempt to get into a combat capable mode. 2015 may be a bit premature but they will get it done. Also, I can confirm that nothing special is going on with the Varyag except with the possible name change but that doesnt mean anything either. What is interesting is that the J-11BS has been seen at CFTE last week which is the second domestically produced Flanker clone which is supposed to be a heavy, multi-role strike aircraft like the F-15E and supposedly the \"naval flanker\" variant J-11BJ is expected by 2010 so why would they be investing in Naval aircraft if they didnt plan on having an aircraft carrier by 2015 for the aircraft to be serial produced and ready by then? Additionally, if the stepped up production of the Yuan class sub is any indication(already 3rd boat nearing completion in less than 4 years)the Chinese may be able to pull off an ambitious carrier project in a similar speedy manner as well. I still wouldnt rule out using the Varyag as a testing/training ship.",

Does anyone have a lead on a story I barely heard about Turkey building parts for the F22 with Chinese parts that make the aircraft vulnerable? If true that is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard of...allowing the enemy to build parts of your weapons system. Let me know where I can read the lowdown on this so I will be actually informed. Tell me it ain't true!",

We have our fleet spread out all over the world. China does not. We have to transit choke points. China has to close them. We are far from the battlespace. China is close. The real crux of all of this is that we are vulnerable (as pertains to this conversation), and China is not. They do not want a world-spanning super-navy to challenge ours; rather, they want a world class regional navy that can stop ours from achieving our objectives in a small defined area. They are doing a damned good job of that - in fact, my guess is that the only thing preventing them from temporary parity/superiority is their training and doctrine. Refusal to see China as an emerging naval power that can threaten our regional superiority is wishful thinking. They have a Secret Weapon we have no control over, cannot reason with, or counter. O.B.A.M.A.. They are the lender, We are the borrower. They can raise the interest. They can raise the rent. They can cash in.",
