I've heard several women make statements such as they missed those month or two(or more) breaks from their husbands once they got out of the military. Of course that may sound like said person has a bad marriage to the ''outside'', but once you get accustomed to a certain lifestyle for a decade or two, it can take some getting used to. I personally think small breaks from each other helps keep the passion going, and adds a little excitement. Is the adjustment the same for the guys? \"It is the weak who are cruel.
