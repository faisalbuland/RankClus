Same thing that gets the fanatics in our country worked up. They (over there) could care less about \"our\" gods. They are not going to stop and think... \"Ooooooh, their god is more fanatical than ours.\" There are no 'innocent civilians' in their scheme of things, just more reasons to eradicate the infidels and terrorize their like into submission to their view of their fanatical god. Never-the-less, who speaks for god is a very ancient debate... which imaginary superhero is greater. Marvel Comics couldn't do it better. So, I guess the most \"real\" god will win? I'd like to sit this one out... but I am afraid they'll both go after me given a chance to do so. So, I'm surrounded, regardless of what god names they hurl into space.",
