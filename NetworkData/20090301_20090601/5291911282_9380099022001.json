Worst of all, the DHS report has even accused returning military veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as potential domestic terrorists because of their military training. As a military veteran myself, I am appalled by this. The DHS under the Obama administration and Janet Napolitano is overstepping its original purpose of monitoring foreign terrorist threats from abroad, and is now attacking and monitoring loyal Americans thru intimidation and monitoring domestic emails. This violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the US Constitution. Congressional hearings should be conducted on the Department of Homeland Security for it's recent activities. Janet Napolitano must be forced to resign or bipartisan pressue put on President Obama to fire her. Thank you.",

Worst of all, the DHS report has even accused returning military veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as potential domestic terrorists because of their military training. As a military veteran myself, I am appalled by this. The DHS under the Obama administration and Janet Napolitano is overstepping its original purpose of monitoring foreign terrorist threats from abroad, and is now attacking and monitoring loyal Americans thru intimidation and monitoring domestic emails. This violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the US Constitution. Congressional hearings should be conducted on the Department of Homeland Security for it's recent activities. Janet Napolitano must be forced to resign or bipartisan pressue put on President Obama to fire her. Thank you.",

If we are at the point where our Gorvernment has to worry about its own Military members turning on them, then what does this say to all of you. Its not like this report suggests just a few might turn. This report suggests that many may turn. So whats the next step after this. Do we now distrust our Military, then our FBI, our CIA our NSA, our Police and law enforcement. The people who defend our nation, our families and friends. Do we no longer hold them with the upmost respect and value their efforts. It is those who defend our nation on all fronts that will hold you accountable, you Socialists and Communists.",

Worst of all, the DHS report has even accused returning military veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as potential domestic terrorists because of their military training. As a military veteran myself, I am appalled by this. The DHS under the Obama administration and Janet Napolitano is overstepping its original purpose of monitoring foreign terrorist threats from abroad, and is now attacking and monitoring loyal Americans thru intimidation and monitoring domestic emails. This violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the US Constitution. Congressional hearings should be conducted on the Department of Homeland Security for it's recent activities. Janet Napolitano must be forced to resign or bipartisan pressue put on President Obama to fire her. Thank you.",

Do we no longer hold them with the upmost respect and value their efforts. It is those who defend our nation on all fronts that will hold you accountable, you Socialists and Communists.",
