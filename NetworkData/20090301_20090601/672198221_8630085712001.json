I wanted to believe in him but it didn't take long for that hope to crash and burn as I have watched him try and take control of every aspect of this country, including us Americans. Why is it that you want the government to control us and everything we do or don't do? Go ahead... you keep telling yourself that I am living in a world of delusions and Obama will actually keep at least 1 promise he has made. Convince yourself that the trillions of dollars he is trying to use to bail every loser out, isn't being made on a copy machine. I know it makes you feel all that much more superior to think we are all a bunch of idiots. But don't be suprised when reality slaps you in the face.",

No, candidates' children (especially young children and teenagers) are not fair game, regardless of their parents' politics. Recall that when the story about Bristol Palin first broke, Barak Obama was very emphatic, that politicians' families are off limits and their children are especially off-limits. Barack Obama and Sarah Palin are fair game. Their spouses MAY be fair game, particularly if they intentionally insert themselves into the political process. However, their children never asked to become part of the public process, and they deserve privacy and to be left alone.",
