I could be wrong but I don't think there is a way to create a bomb as we know the \"bomb\" that generates a magnetic pulse besides an atomic warhead. You might be able to create a EMP Generator to go off at a specific time and point it at a specific target but the worst you could do is cause all off the electronics to burn out. Bomb? No. It would be a great device for an attack but the setup would be difficult and the machine would be seriously bulky. Power to supply this device would be a serious consideration as well. A standard off the shelf \"atomic\" bomb would create an electromagnetic pulse that would perform the same function yet it would destroy all the structures and poison the well.
