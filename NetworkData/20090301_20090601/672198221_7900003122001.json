To put this \"issue\" in perspective, let's take a look at the question in the context of the other questions that were asked. First, the questioners were chosen by random lottery, with one of the judges not being allowed to ask a question at all. I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others?

        "reply": " Response from me on pcp: They probably had her profile and she most likely made the mistake of mentioning that she is a Christian, so she was going to get asked a stupid question. Really why ask a political question. Besides the audience was just pizzed to see a real woman. These people cry themselves to sleep every night wishing they were 10% as hot a woman as her.",

To put this \"issue\" in perspective, let's take a look at the question in the context of the other questions that were asked.

I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",
