Nato ordered the 11-week bombing on March 24 1999 after Slobodan Milosevic, the then Serbian president, refused to sign an internationally brokered peace plan for Kosovo. Nato's forces sought to force Serbia out of the province of Kosovo, where Serbs were being accused of persecuting the Albanian majority. Boris Tadic, Serbia's president, in a speech on the eve of the anniversary before the UN Security Council in New York, described Nato's intervention as a \"tragic military campaign\". \"The lesson for Serbia is that it must not get into a situation in which its citizens are punished and killed ever again,\" he said. \"Some 2,500 civilians were killed, among them 89 children, while 12,500 were injured,\" said Tadic, whose governing Democratic Party opposes Kosovo's independence. Serbia estimates that the campaign cost $30bn from direct damage alone. At least 15,000 Nato-led peacekeepers remain in Kosovo, which 56 nations recognise after its ethnic Albanian-dominated parliament declared unilateral independence from Serbia in February 2008.
