Their answer is: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I cannot help you with \u201cDepartment of Veterans Affairs Policy\u201d. Here is my \u201cDilemma\u201d I am currently out of work. I have worked for the Federal Government for almost 15 (dedicated) years. I am a retired US Navy Veteran (25 years) of honorable service. After retirement, I went to work for the Department of Defense, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton. I started working as a GS-1173-4/5/7. This was an \u201cupward mobility\u201d position. It was a wonderful job. I worked there for almost 9 years. I worked my way up from a GS-1173-4 to a GS 1173-7 (step 10). Step ten was/is the highest step you can achieve as a GS employee. I worked hard to get to that step. I always wanted to work for the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2026and the only way I figured was to go back to school. I went to school and learned \u201cmedical terminology\u201d and \u201cmedical administration\u201d. Upon completing this course. I applied for a job with the Veterans Hospital in \u201cReno\u201d Nevada. I had been out of work for almost 20 months (going to school). I was hired as a GS-0303-5/6. When I started working, Human Resources told me \u201cbecause I worked in Civil Service before\u2026.\u201dtheir\u201d policy was to attempt to pay at the highest pay held at a previous job. Even though I was not working for the past 18 months\u2026they started me at a GS-0303-5 Step 10. Then\u2026.once I went through the probationary period, I was promoted to GS-0303-6 and was also given a step 10. After working at the Reno Nevada Veterans Hospital for almost 4 years\u2026.my wife and I decided to follow our Grand Children to Texas. We wanted to be close to them. There was a huge VA Hospital in Temple, Texas\u2026where I thought I could get a job. About two years went past\u2026.and I finally got a job in Big Spring, Texas. It was a GS-0525-6/7 job. They would not give me a step 10. They said because of me not having the required experience as an accounting technician, they would have to start me at a step 1. After talking with the Human Resources Chief, she finally decided to give me step 7. I tried to talk with the VA Hospital Director\u2026but he refused to see me or talk with me\u2026regarding this issue. Because I needed the job\u2026..I let it be at that. I spoke to the Director of Human Resources from Reno, NV and he told me \u201cits up to the \u201cLocal VA Hospital\u201d. There are times\u2026when I feel the Federal Government should not have their fingers in everything\u2026.but in this case\u2026.there should be a \u201cstandard\u201d policy for everyone to follow\u2026.not leave it up to the Human Resources Director. To make a longer story as short as possible\u2026.I was recently selected for a GS-0303-6 position in Portland, Oregon. I told the hiring person I was a GS-0303-6 step ten\u2026and faxed them proof of this position. The hiring person\u2026.said they have a budget and can only hire as a Step 1. I had to turn down the job. I have already sent correspondence to Congressmen and Senators regarding this. Their answer is: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I cannot help you with \u201cDepartment of Veterans Affairs Policy\u201d. I applied for another job, this one in New Hampshire. It\u2019s the same job as in Portland, Or., but this time I was hired and offered a \u201cstep 10\u201d. I just can\u2019t understand why/how one section of the agency can offer a step 10\u2026and the other only a step 1. Thank you Sir\u2026.for listening",

Their answer is: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I cannot help you with \u201cDepartment of Veterans Affairs Policy\u201d. Here is my \u201cDilemma\u201d I am currently out of work. I have worked for the Federal Government for almost 15 (dedicated) years. I am a retired US Navy Veteran (25 years) of honorable service. After retirement, I went to work for the Department of Defense, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton. I started working as a GS-1173-4/5/7. This was an \u201cupward mobility\u201d position. It was a wonderful job. I worked there for almost 9 years. I worked my way up from a GS-1173-4 to a GS 1173-7 (step 10). Step ten was/is the highest step you can achieve as a GS employee. I worked hard to get to that step. I always wanted to work for the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2026and the only way I figured was to go back to school. I went to school and learned \u201cmedical terminology\u201d and \u201cmedical administration\u201d. Upon completing this course. I applied for a job with the Veterans Hospital in \u201cReno\u201d Nevada. I had been out of work for almost 20 months (going to school). I was hired as a GS-0303-5/6. When I started working, Human Resources told me \u201cbecause I worked in Civil Service before\u2026.\u201dtheir\u201d policy was to attempt to pay at the highest pay held at a previous job. Even though I was not working for the past 18 months\u2026they started me at a GS-0303-5 Step 10. Then\u2026.once I went through the probationary period, I was promoted to GS-0303-6 and was also given a step 10. After working at the Reno Nevada Veterans Hospital for almost 4 years\u2026.my wife and I decided to follow our Grand Children to Texas. We wanted to be close to them. There was a huge VA Hospital in Temple, Texas\u2026where I thought I could get a job. About two years went past\u2026.and I finally got a job in Big Spring, Texas. It was a GS-0525-6/7 job. They would not give me a step 10. They said because of me not having the required experience as an accounting technician, they would have to start me at a step 1. After talking with the Human Resources Chief, she finally decided to give me step 7. I tried to talk with the VA Hospital Director\u2026but he refused to see me or talk with me\u2026regarding this issue. Because I needed the job\u2026..I let it be at that. I spoke to the Director of Human Resources from Reno, NV and he told me \u201cits up to the \u201cLocal VA Hospital\u201d. There are times\u2026when I feel the Federal Government should not have their fingers in everything\u2026.but in this case\u2026.there should be a \u201cstandard\u201d policy for everyone to follow\u2026.not leave it up to the Human Resources Director. To make a longer story as short as possible\u2026.I was recently selected for a GS-0303-6 position in Portland, Oregon. I told the hiring person I was a GS-0303-6 step ten\u2026and faxed them proof of this position. The hiring person\u2026.said they have a budget and can only hire as a Step 1. I had to turn down the job. I have already sent correspondence to Congressmen and Senators regarding this. Their answer is: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I cannot help you with \u201cDepartment of Veterans Affairs Policy\u201d. I applied for another job, this one in New Hampshire. It\u2019s the same job as in Portland, Or., but this time I was hired and offered a \u201cstep 10\u201d. I just can\u2019t understand why/how one section of the agency can offer a step 10\u2026and the other only a step 1. Thank you Sir\u2026.for listening",
