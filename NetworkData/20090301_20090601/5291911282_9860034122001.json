I am fixing their electric woes, and as payment they are creating a number of custom embroidery work shirts for me - 6 T-shirts, 6 long-sleeve T-shirts, and 6 collared denim long-sleeve shirts for bidding jobs and looking professional as I deal with customers. I have all the basic graphics, but I'd like to tweak most of them and present this client a graphic depiction of EXACTLY what I want on my shirts and where. The problem is that I absolutely suck at Photoshop, a likely prodigy of the fact that I don't even have the program installed. I'm wondering if one of you all proficient in graphics is willing to help me out. I'll send you the verbal ideas, and you create pictures of what I'd like so I can pass them along to my client. I cannot compensate you for your effort, so this would be only as a favor. I write professional resumes, so perhaps I can repay your generosity at some time. If you can help me out -- if you're willing -- please send me a private message with your email address and I'll send you what I have and what I need. There's no enormous rush, but I would really like to complete this post haste so that I can finalize this contract and move on. Anyone willing to lend a brother a hand? It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
