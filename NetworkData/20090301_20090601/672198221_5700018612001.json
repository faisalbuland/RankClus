As reported by Canada's CBC news: quote: Top Democrat says it will take 600,000 troops to win Afghan war Published: Tuesday, March 3, 2009 | 2:22 PM ET Canadian Press News WASHINGTON - U.S. Congressman John Murtha says the situation in Afghanistan is so challenging that he estimates it would take 600,000 troops to get the country under control. The Pennsylvania Democrat, who chairs the powerful subcommittee that funds the military, says his figure is based on the country's history of war and its size. He also says he's uncomfortable with President Barack Obama's decision to increase the number of troops in the country by 17,000 before a goal is clearly defined. But he says he anticipates a plan will be developed to train Afghans, and then the U.S. military will get out. Obama recently announced new troops would be sent to Afghanistan to augment the 38,000 there... COMMENT: It's always \"gratifying\" whenever any Congressman so generously offers his military expertise in \"assisting\" Joint Staff and warfighting command planners in devising operations and strategy. Mr. Murtha should focus on his expertise -- special earmarks for his Congressional district -- and leave the military planning to the specialists. This reminds me of the staffer from then-Sen. Connie Mack's office who approached me at a meeting in the Pentagon in 1990 to discuss the senator's bold and aggressive plan to place an Army brigade behind Iraqi lines on the tapline road to create mayhem a'la John Mosby (the Grey Ghost) while a coalition armor thrust further east would penetrate Iraqi forces in Kuwait. It was the most embarrassingly amateurish plan that clearly would have doomed this brigade. After listening to this presentation in detail for more than an hour, I asked the staffer why the senator would offer such a plan personally to which he replied, \"The senator wants to help in the war effort.\" I responded that the senator's best possible assistance was on the Senate floor, and that war planning should be left to the war planners. I then told him that the senator would be publicly embarrassed if his plan was ever revealed to the press; fortunately, we never heard from the senator's office again. And in similar fashion like Greyhound's motto, \"Leave the driving to us,\" Mr. Murtha should leave planning to the professionals who know what they're doing.",

As reported by Canada's CBC news: quote: Top Democrat says it will take 600,000 troops to win Afghan war Published: Tuesday, March 3, 2009 | 2:22 PM ET Canadian Press News WASHINGTON - U.S. Congressman John Murtha says the situation in Afghanistan is so challenging that he estimates it would take 600,000 troops to get the country under control. The Pennsylvania Democrat, who chairs the powerful subcommittee that funds the military, says his figure is based on the country's history of war and its size. He also says he's uncomfortable with President Barack Obama's decision to increase the number of troops in the country by 17,000 before a goal is clearly defined. But he says he anticipates a plan will be developed to train Afghans, and then the U.S. military will get out. Obama recently announced new troops would be sent to Afghanistan to augment the 38,000 there... COMMENT: It's always \"gratifying\" whenever any Congressman so generously offers his military expertise in \"assisting\" Joint Staff and warfighting command planners in devising operations and strategy. Mr. Murtha should focus on his expertise -- special earmarks for his Congressional district -- and leave the military planning to the specialists. This reminds me of the staffer from then-Sen. Connie Mack's office who approached me at a meeting in the Pentagon in 1990 to discuss the senator's bold and aggressive plan to place an Army brigade behind Iraqi lines on the tapline road to create mayhem a'la John Mosby (the Grey Ghost) while a coalition armor thrust further east would penetrate Iraqi forces in Kuwait. It was the most embarrassingly amateurish plan that clearly would have doomed this brigade. After listening to this presentation in detail for more than an hour, I asked the staffer why the senator would offer such a plan personally to which he replied, \"The senator wants to help in the war effort.\" I responded that the senator's best possible assistance was on the Senate floor, and that war planning should be left to the war planners. I then told him that the senator would be publicly embarrassed if his plan was ever revealed to the press; fortunately, we never heard from the senator's office again. And in similar fashion like Greyhound's motto, \"Leave the driving to us,\" Mr. Murtha should leave planning to the professionals who know what they're doing.",

He may actually be right, giving some room for hyperbole. The problem is that we are too quickly forgetting what terrible harm he has done to the Marine Corps and how he is trying to duck it all of a sudden. I think he's just getting on the pro-war bandwagon now that his party, which IS the traditional war party, has. He needs to be tried in court for what he has done. It is a matter of justice. His party talks about justice so often, but it is an abstract. When you deal in the abstract issues you can ignore them easily. Conservatives don't deal in the abstract. We stand for traditions, family, religion - things that are tangible and clearly defined. Add to that the rule of law. When our man, Duke Cunningham, was caught doing wrong, he paid the price. Duke is one of the greatest living heroes who went into politics. He was far greater than John McCain, to be sure. Still he faced the music and neither received nor asked for a pardon. Most nations would allow him to exit the stage gratefully. The enemy within howls for his blood to this day, even as they besmirch his honor and service while lauding the false service of others, like Kerry and Murtha. Murtha has committed far worse a crime: He lied about Marines in a time of war to the benefit of the enemy's propaganda machine, which is the enemy's greatest and most effective weapon. He must be tried, as proud (and boastful) of his very limited service as he may be. COMMENT: Here we go again; we \"fought\" this debate last spring. Bottom line -- if you genuinely think Mr. Murtha is legally guilty of slander, line up your facts, and good luck with your lawsuit. You can condemn his remarks \"forever,\" but you're not going to get any legal satisfaction, and his constituents re-elected him. I think your outrage expressed on this forum is about all of the satisfaction you'll realistically garner about Mr. Murtha.",
