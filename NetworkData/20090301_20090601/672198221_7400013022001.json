Sarah Palin (R) announced Thursday that she has sent a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates urging him not to go forward with plans to cut $1.4 billion out of missile defense. \"I would like to express my deep concern over your proposed budget cuts to the Missile Defense Agency,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"In these crucial times of rocket design and technology development by North Korea and Iran, I believe the global missile defense shield is more important now than ever.\" Read the full text of Palin's letter, which is dated April 8, by clicking here. The letter is one of the first times since the 2008 election that John McCain's former running mate has weighed in on an issue with national security implications. Up until now, Palin's criticism of the Obama administration has focused on economics (she rejected 55 percent of the stimulus money available to her state out of a concern that it would grow the size of state government once the federal dollars dry up) and on sensitivity (she slammed President Obama for joking on the \"Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" that his poor bowling skills resemble those found at the Special Olympics). While Palin has made an effort during her state's legislative session to appear solely focused on issues of concern to Alaska, missile defense provides her with an opportunity to play locally and nationally at the same time. On the Alaska front, she is able to advocate on behalf of missile defense implementation at Fort Greely and the development of future technology through the Kodiak Launch Complex. On the national front, the potential 2012 candidate for president is able to warn that the Obama administration's proposed cuts to missile defense will erode \"our security, our freedom, and our American way of life.\" \"I am deeply concerned with North Korea's development and testing program,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"It has the clear potential of impacting Alaska, Hawaii, and possibly the West Coast with a nuclear armed warhead.\" \"Alaska's strategic location and the system currently in place have proven invaluable in defending this great nation,\" Palin's letter continues. \"Any cuts to the sole missile defense system for the United States has the potential of sending the wrong message to our adversaries with the unintended consequences of placing our nation at increased risk of offensive missile threats in the future.\" Neither the Pentagon nor the White House immediately responded to a request for comment.",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 What's this say to you? A defense spending increase\u2014not a cut The defense budget proposed by Secretary Gates does not represent a defense cut. In fact, the budget proposal represents a defense spending increase, making it the 11th straight year the core defense budget has risen in real terms. * FY 2009 defense budget $513 billion * FY 2010 defense budget request $534 billion A $21 billion increase http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/pdf/defense_budget_fact_sheet.pdf Improving needed capabilities This proposal will increase funding for urgently needed U.S. defense capabilities. Secretary Gates\u2019 recommendations enhance the capabilities most needed by our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gates\u2019 proposal will actually increase spending for urgently needed manpower needs and some weapons platforms while canceling defense spending for programs that are over cost, behind schedule, useless for counterinsurgency operations, and unneeded for the foreseeable future. Increases -Grow the Force Initiative: Increasing the size of the Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces will relieve stress on these forces. -Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: UAVs are in high demand in both Iraq and Afghanistan. -Littoral Combat Ship: LCS is a key capability for presence, stability, and counterinsurgency operations in coastal regions. -F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: The F-35 is less costly than the F-22 and gives the United States the capability to maintain air superiority for the foreseeable future. Missile defense: Funding for proven theater missile defense technologies will increase while funding for systems with technical problems will be canceled. Reductions F-22 Raptor: This incredibly costly fighter is a plane without an enemy and has never been used in either Iraq or Afghanistan. The Air Force will still get 187 of these planes, four more than the number that the Bush administration approved in 2005. Future Combat Systems Vehicles: FCS vehicles would have no practical use in either Iraq or Afghanistan. And their design would make them highly vulnerable to attacks commonly used by insurgents in both theaters. Presidential helicopter: Also known as the \u201cpresidential limousine,\u201d the cost of this program has nearly doubled and is currently six years behind schedule. With the increased cost, each new helicopter would have cost more than Air Force One. Jobs This proposal will not significantly affect U.S. jobs in aerospace or shipbuilding. In fact, these proposals will provide a net increase in direct employment in the aerospace industry. * Currently, 24,000 workers are directly employed in producing the F-22 for Lockheed Martin. This number will be reduced to 11,000 by the end of 2011 when the economy is expected to be on more stable ground. However, these losses will be dramatically offset by jobs created by the increase in F-35 production. * The F-35 program, also administered by Lockheed Martin, currently employs 38,000 people. According to Secretary Gates, more than doubling F-35 production in FY2010 will mean adding 44,000 American jobs next year, to bring the total F-35 workforce in that year to 82,000. * While ending production of the F-22 will mean that some workers will have to change jobs, increased production of the F-35 should give current F-22 employees an opportunity to transition from one program to another. In some cases, workers on these planes already operate closely together. * Following the cancellation of the DDG-1000 destroyer, that project\u2019s workforce can transition to work on the restarted DDG-51 production line, as well as work on the Littoral Combat Ships which Gates plans to buy in large quantities. The Pentagon has agreed on a plan to distribute work on the DDG-51 between the contractors currently assigned to the DDG-1000. http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/fact_sheet_defense.html",

Sarah Palin (R) announced Thursday that she has sent a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates urging him not to go forward with plans to cut $1.4 billion out of missile defense. \"I would like to express my deep concern over your proposed budget cuts to the Missile Defense Agency,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"In these crucial times of rocket design and technology development by North Korea and Iran, I believe the global missile defense shield is more important now than ever.\" Read the full text of Palin's letter, which is dated April 8, by clicking here. The letter is one of the first times since the 2008 election that John McCain's former running mate has weighed in on an issue with national security implications. Up until now, Palin's criticism of the Obama administration has focused on economics (she rejected 55 percent of the stimulus money available to her state out of a concern that it would grow the size of state government once the federal dollars dry up) and on sensitivity (she slammed President Obama for joking on the \"Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" that his poor bowling skills resemble those found at the Special Olympics). While Palin has made an effort during her state's legislative session to appear solely focused on issues of concern to Alaska, missile defense provides her with an opportunity to play locally and nationally at the same time. On the Alaska front, she is able to advocate on behalf of missile defense implementation at Fort Greely and the development of future technology through the Kodiak Launch Complex. On the national front, the potential 2012 candidate for president is able to warn that the Obama administration's proposed cuts to missile defense will erode \"our security, our freedom, and our American way of life.\" \"I am deeply concerned with North Korea's development and testing program,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"It has the clear potential of impacting Alaska, Hawaii, and possibly the West Coast with a nuclear armed warhead.\" \"Alaska's strategic location and the system currently in place have proven invaluable in defending this great nation,\" Palin's letter continues. \"Any cuts to the sole missile defense system for the United States has the potential of sending the wrong message to our adversaries with the unintended consequences of placing our nation at increased risk of offensive missile threats in the future.\" Neither the Pentagon nor the White House immediately responded to a request for comment.",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 What's this say to you? A defense spending increase\u2014not a cut The defense budget proposed by Secretary Gates does not represent a defense cut. In fact, the budget proposal represents a defense spending increase, making it the 11th straight year the core defense budget has risen in real terms. * FY 2009 defense budget $513 billion * FY 2010 defense budget request $534 billion A $21 billion increase http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/pdf/defense_budget_fact_sheet.pdf Improving needed capabilities This proposal will increase funding for urgently needed U.S. defense capabilities. Secretary Gates\u2019 recommendations enhance the capabilities most needed by our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gates\u2019 proposal will actually increase spending for urgently needed manpower needs and some weapons platforms while canceling defense spending for programs that are over cost, behind schedule, useless for counterinsurgency operations, and unneeded for the foreseeable future. Increases -Grow the Force Initiative: Increasing the size of the Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces will relieve stress on these forces. -Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: UAVs are in high demand in both Iraq and Afghanistan. -Littoral Combat Ship: LCS is a key capability for presence, stability, and counterinsurgency operations in coastal regions. -F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: The F-35 is less costly than the F-22 and gives the United States the capability to maintain air superiority for the foreseeable future. Missile defense: Funding for proven theater missile defense technologies will increase while funding for systems with technical problems will be canceled. Reductions F-22 Raptor: This incredibly costly fighter is a plane without an enemy and has never been used in either Iraq or Afghanistan. The Air Force will still get 187 of these planes, four more than the number that the Bush administration approved in 2005. Future Combat Systems Vehicles: FCS vehicles would have no practical use in either Iraq or Afghanistan. And their design would make them highly vulnerable to attacks commonly used by insurgents in both theaters. Presidential helicopter: Also known as the \u201cpresidential limousine,\u201d the cost of this program has nearly doubled and is currently six years behind schedule. With the increased cost, each new helicopter would have cost more than Air Force One. Jobs This proposal will not significantly affect U.S. jobs in aerospace or shipbuilding. In fact, these proposals will provide a net increase in direct employment in the aerospace industry. * Currently, 24,000 workers are directly employed in producing the F-22 for Lockheed Martin. This number will be reduced to 11,000 by the end of 2011 when the economy is expected to be on more stable ground. However, these losses will be dramatically offset by jobs created by the increase in F-35 production. * The F-35 program, also administered by Lockheed Martin, currently employs 38,000 people. According to Secretary Gates, more than doubling F-35 production in FY2010 will mean adding 44,000 American jobs next year, to bring the total F-35 workforce in that year to 82,000. * While ending production of the F-22 will mean that some workers will have to change jobs, increased production of the F-35 should give current F-22 employees an opportunity to transition from one program to another. In some cases, workers on these planes already operate closely together. * Following the cancellation of the DDG-1000 destroyer, that project\u2019s workforce can transition to work on the restarted DDG-51 production line, as well as work on the Littoral Combat Ships which Gates plans to buy in large quantities. The Pentagon has agreed on a plan to distribute work on the DDG-51 between the contractors currently assigned to the DDG-1000. http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/fact_sheet_defense.html",

        "reply": " What's this say to you? A defense spending increase\u2014not a cut The defense budget proposed by Secretary Gates does not represent a defense cut. In fact, the budget proposal represents a defense spending increase, making it the 11th straight year the core defense budget has risen in real terms. * FY 2009 defense budget $513 billion * FY 2010 defense budget request $534 billion A $21 billion increase http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/pdf/defense_budget_fact_sheet.pdf Improving needed capabilities This proposal will increase funding for urgently needed U.S. defense capabilities. Secretary Gates\u2019 recommendations enhance the capabilities most needed by our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gates\u2019 proposal will actually increase spending for urgently needed manpower needs and some weapons platforms while canceling defense spending for programs that are over cost, behind schedule, useless for counterinsurgency operations, and unneeded for the foreseeable future. Increases -Grow the Force Initiative: Increasing the size of the Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces will relieve stress on these forces. -Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: UAVs are in high demand in both Iraq and Afghanistan. -Littoral Combat Ship: LCS is a key capability for presence, stability, and counterinsurgency operations in coastal regions. -F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: The F-35 is less costly than the F-22 and gives the United States the capability to maintain air superiority for the foreseeable future. Missile defense: Funding for proven theater missile defense technologies will increase while funding for systems with technical problems will be canceled. Reductions F-22 Raptor: This incredibly costly fighter is a plane without an enemy and has never been used in either Iraq or Afghanistan. The Air Force will still get 187 of these planes, four more than the number that the Bush administration approved in 2005. Future Combat Systems Vehicles: FCS vehicles would have no practical use in either Iraq or Afghanistan. And their design would make them highly vulnerable to attacks commonly used by insurgents in both theaters. Presidential helicopter: Also known as the \u201cpresidential limousine,\u201d the cost of this program has nearly doubled and is currently six years behind schedule. With the increased cost, each new helicopter would have cost more than Air Force One. Jobs This proposal will not significantly affect U.S. jobs in aerospace or shipbuilding. In fact, these proposals will provide a net increase in direct employment in the aerospace industry. * Currently, 24,000 workers are directly employed in producing the F-22 for Lockheed Martin. This number will be reduced to 11,000 by the end of 2011 when the economy is expected to be on more stable ground. However, these losses will be dramatically offset by jobs created by the increase in F-35 production. * The F-35 program, also administered by Lockheed Martin, currently employs 38,000 people. According to Secretary Gates, more than doubling F-35 production in FY2010 will mean adding 44,000 American jobs next year, to bring the total F-35 workforce in that year to 82,000. * While ending production of the F-22 will mean that some workers will have to change jobs, increased production of the F-35 should give current F-22 employees an opportunity to transition from one program to another. In some cases, workers on these planes already operate closely together. * Following the cancellation of the DDG-1000 destroyer, that project\u2019s workforce can transition to work on the restarted DDG-51 production line, as well as work on the Littoral Combat Ships which Gates plans to buy in large quantities. The Pentagon has agreed on a plan to distribute work on the DDG-51 between the contractors currently assigned to the DDG-1000. http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/fact_sheet_defense.html",

Sarah Palin (R) announced Thursday that she has sent a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates urging him not to go forward with plans to cut $1.4 billion out of missile defense. \"I would like to express my deep concern over your proposed budget cuts to the Missile Defense Agency,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"In these crucial times of rocket design and technology development by North Korea and Iran, I believe the global missile defense shield is more important now than ever.\" Read the full text of Palin's letter, which is dated April 8, by clicking here. The letter is one of the first times since the 2008 election that John McCain's former running mate has weighed in on an issue with national security implications. Up until now, Palin's criticism of the Obama administration has focused on economics (she rejected 55 percent of the stimulus money available to her state out of a concern that it would grow the size of state government once the federal dollars dry up) and on sensitivity (she slammed President Obama for joking on the \"Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" that his poor bowling skills resemble those found at the Special Olympics). While Palin has made an effort during her state's legislative session to appear solely focused on issues of concern to Alaska, missile defense provides her with an opportunity to play locally and nationally at the same time. On the Alaska front, she is able to advocate on behalf of missile defense implementation at Fort Greely and the development of future technology through the Kodiak Launch Complex. On the national front, the potential 2012 candidate for president is able to warn that the Obama administration's proposed cuts to missile defense will erode \"our security, our freedom, and our American way of life.\" \"I am deeply concerned with North Korea's development and testing program,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"It has the clear potential of impacting Alaska, Hawaii, and possibly the West Coast with a nuclear armed warhead.\" \"Alaska's strategic location and the system currently in place have proven invaluable in defending this great nation,\" Palin's letter continues. \"Any cuts to the sole missile defense system for the United States has the potential of sending the wrong message to our adversaries with the unintended consequences of placing our nation at increased risk of offensive missile threats in the future.\" Neither the Pentagon nor the White House immediately responded to a request for comment.",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 What's this say to you? A defense spending increase\u2014not a cut The defense budget proposed by Secretary Gates does not represent a defense cut. In fact, the budget proposal represents a defense spending increase, making it the 11th straight year the core defense budget has risen in real terms. * FY 2009 defense budget $513 billion * FY 2010 defense budget request $534 billion A $21 billion increase http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/pdf/defense_budget_fact_sheet.pdf Improving needed capabilities This proposal will increase funding for urgently needed U.S. defense capabilities. Secretary Gates\u2019 recommendations enhance the capabilities most needed by our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gates\u2019 proposal will actually increase spending for urgently needed manpower needs and some weapons platforms while canceling defense spending for programs that are over cost, behind schedule, useless for counterinsurgency operations, and unneeded for the foreseeable future. Increases -Grow the Force Initiative: Increasing the size of the Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces will relieve stress on these forces. -Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: UAVs are in high demand in both Iraq and Afghanistan. -Littoral Combat Ship: LCS is a key capability for presence, stability, and counterinsurgency operations in coastal regions. -F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: The F-35 is less costly than the F-22 and gives the United States the capability to maintain air superiority for the foreseeable future. Missile defense: Funding for proven theater missile defense technologies will increase while funding for systems with technical problems will be canceled. Reductions F-22 Raptor: This incredibly costly fighter is a plane without an enemy and has never been used in either Iraq or Afghanistan. The Air Force will still get 187 of these planes, four more than the number that the Bush administration approved in 2005. Future Combat Systems Vehicles: FCS vehicles would have no practical use in either Iraq or Afghanistan. And their design would make them highly vulnerable to attacks commonly used by insurgents in both theaters. Presidential helicopter: Also known as the \u201cpresidential limousine,\u201d the cost of this program has nearly doubled and is currently six years behind schedule. With the increased cost, each new helicopter would have cost more than Air Force One. Jobs This proposal will not significantly affect U.S. jobs in aerospace or shipbuilding. In fact, these proposals will provide a net increase in direct employment in the aerospace industry. * Currently, 24,000 workers are directly employed in producing the F-22 for Lockheed Martin. This number will be reduced to 11,000 by the end of 2011 when the economy is expected to be on more stable ground. However, these losses will be dramatically offset by jobs created by the increase in F-35 production. * The F-35 program, also administered by Lockheed Martin, currently employs 38,000 people. According to Secretary Gates, more than doubling F-35 production in FY2010 will mean adding 44,000 American jobs next year, to bring the total F-35 workforce in that year to 82,000. * While ending production of the F-22 will mean that some workers will have to change jobs, increased production of the F-35 should give current F-22 employees an opportunity to transition from one program to another. In some cases, workers on these planes already operate closely together. * Following the cancellation of the DDG-1000 destroyer, that project\u2019s workforce can transition to work on the restarted DDG-51 production line, as well as work on the Littoral Combat Ships which Gates plans to buy in large quantities. The Pentagon has agreed on a plan to distribute work on the DDG-51 between the contractors currently assigned to the DDG-1000. http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/fact_sheet_defense.html",

Sarah Palin (R) announced Thursday that she has sent a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates urging him not to go forward with plans to cut $1.4 billion out of missile defense. \"I would like to express my deep concern over your proposed budget cuts to the Missile Defense Agency,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"In these crucial times of rocket design and technology development by North Korea and Iran, I believe the global missile defense shield is more important now than ever.\" Read the full text of Palin's letter, which is dated April 8, by clicking here. The letter is one of the first times since the 2008 election that John McCain's former running mate has weighed in on an issue with national security implications. Up until now, Palin's criticism of the Obama administration has focused on economics (she rejected 55 percent of the stimulus money available to her state out of a concern that it would grow the size of state government once the federal dollars dry up) and on sensitivity (she slammed President Obama for joking on the \"Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" that his poor bowling skills resemble those found at the Special Olympics). While Palin has made an effort during her state's legislative session to appear solely focused on issues of concern to Alaska, missile defense provides her with an opportunity to play locally and nationally at the same time. On the Alaska front, she is able to advocate on behalf of missile defense implementation at Fort Greely and the development of future technology through the Kodiak Launch Complex. On the national front, the potential 2012 candidate for president is able to warn that the Obama administration's proposed cuts to missile defense will erode \"our security, our freedom, and our American way of life.\" \"I am deeply concerned with North Korea's development and testing program,\" writes Palin in her letter. \"It has the clear potential of impacting Alaska, Hawaii, and possibly the West Coast with a nuclear armed warhead.\" \"Alaska's strategic location and the system currently in place have proven invaluable in defending this great nation,\" Palin's letter continues. \"Any cuts to the sole missile defense system for the United States has the potential of sending the wrong message to our adversaries with the unintended consequences of placing our nation at increased risk of offensive missile threats in the future.\" Neither the Pentagon nor the White House immediately responded to a request for comment.",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 What's this say to you? A defense spending increase\u2014not a cut The defense budget proposed by Secretary Gates does not represent a defense cut. In fact, the budget proposal represents a defense spending increase, making it the 11th straight year the core defense budget has risen in real terms. * FY 2009 defense budget $513 billion * FY 2010 defense budget request $534 billion A $21 billion increase http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/pdf/defense_budget_fact_sheet.pdf Improving needed capabilities This proposal will increase funding for urgently needed U.S. defense capabilities. Secretary Gates\u2019 recommendations enhance the capabilities most needed by our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gates\u2019 proposal will actually increase spending for urgently needed manpower needs and some weapons platforms while canceling defense spending for programs that are over cost, behind schedule, useless for counterinsurgency operations, and unneeded for the foreseeable future. Increases -Grow the Force Initiative: Increasing the size of the Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces will relieve stress on these forces. -Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: UAVs are in high demand in both Iraq and Afghanistan. -Littoral Combat Ship: LCS is a key capability for presence, stability, and counterinsurgency operations in coastal regions. -F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: The F-35 is less costly than the F-22 and gives the United States the capability to maintain air superiority for the foreseeable future. Missile defense: Funding for proven theater missile defense technologies will increase while funding for systems with technical problems will be canceled. Reductions F-22 Raptor: This incredibly costly fighter is a plane without an enemy and has never been used in either Iraq or Afghanistan. The Air Force will still get 187 of these planes, four more than the number that the Bush administration approved in 2005. Future Combat Systems Vehicles: FCS vehicles would have no practical use in either Iraq or Afghanistan. And their design would make them highly vulnerable to attacks commonly used by insurgents in both theaters. Presidential helicopter: Also known as the \u201cpresidential limousine,\u201d the cost of this program has nearly doubled and is currently six years behind schedule. With the increased cost, each new helicopter would have cost more than Air Force One. Jobs This proposal will not significantly affect U.S. jobs in aerospace or shipbuilding. In fact, these proposals will provide a net increase in direct employment in the aerospace industry. * Currently, 24,000 workers are directly employed in producing the F-22 for Lockheed Martin. This number will be reduced to 11,000 by the end of 2011 when the economy is expected to be on more stable ground. However, these losses will be dramatically offset by jobs created by the increase in F-35 production. * The F-35 program, also administered by Lockheed Martin, currently employs 38,000 people. According to Secretary Gates, more than doubling F-35 production in FY2010 will mean adding 44,000 American jobs next year, to bring the total F-35 workforce in that year to 82,000. * While ending production of the F-22 will mean that some workers will have to change jobs, increased production of the F-35 should give current F-22 employees an opportunity to transition from one program to another. In some cases, workers on these planes already operate closely together. * Following the cancellation of the DDG-1000 destroyer, that project\u2019s workforce can transition to work on the restarted DDG-51 production line, as well as work on the Littoral Combat Ships which Gates plans to buy in large quantities. The Pentagon has agreed on a plan to distribute work on the DDG-51 between the contractors currently assigned to the DDG-1000. http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/fact_sheet_defense.html",
