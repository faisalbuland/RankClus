Well, that is a more mature comment. However, with all due respect...you don't get it. I do think Sarah can make mistakes. I have seen the mistakes she has made here in Alaska. I do believe that it was John McCain's mistake to nominate her. Her experience didn't include being able to perform the duties of the nation's VP. She is more of an honest person that most politians,so that alone would have done her in. She did make the mistake of accepting the nomination, but she has more than paid for that. What is the point of continuing to slam her now? She isn't the VP. Biden is. As far as Huckabee goes, I would have voted for him as CIC if he had stayed with it. It is a damn shame he did not. Also, I don't know how you can compare her to Dan Quail.",

It is all because our Governor was unfortunate enough to get put in the position of not only dealing with a completely bias media but a blind and hateful society as well. She was unprepared for the vile reaction of the dems in the lower 48, to her nomination. It started the minute that happened. No one even knew who she was at that time, but they hated her anyway. She was unprepared for the petty, vicious attacks from the masses. They even brought her children into the vicious attacks against her. She may have faltered a few times but if you really looked closely, you would see that she handled it all with grace. This, all in spite of the shock of being thrown to the wolves by the very person who put her there. The ones who hate her, do not care who she really is. There hatred is based on bias and fear. There is no use in even discussing it with them because the have made up their ignorant minds. I\u2019m just thankful that my hateful, ignorant, non-value having liberal kids that are raised in a non Christian home are not pregnant at the moment. My loving, intelligent, moral children that were raised in a very Christian home are not pregnant, either. What's the point? Don\u2019t claim to be from the party of family values if your own family is like an episode of Jerry Springer. That would be my point. So any family that has a teenage daughter get pregenant is like Jerry Springer? That any parents of such are responsible and have no moral values? If that is your opinion, then I take it you did not have premarital sex in high school or college or whatever?", 
        "reply": " Are all teen age daughters the children of conservative family value politicians? Have you seen the tabloids ant the check out lane recently? Are all pregnant teens featured as prominently? Do all pregnant teen daughters have such gems as the fathers of there children? And as a matter of fact, I did wait until marriage due to a very religious up bringing. Contrary to what you may think, I am quite conservative, just not a Republican. Or Democrat for that matter.",

Don't read the tabloids, but basing the \"Jerry Springer\" statement on them is somewhat silly. Do all teenage pregnancies have responsible people involved? No. Do all marriages have responsible parties involved? No. But that does not mean the entire family is disfunctional. To say that Govenor Palin is not who she seems because of the mistake her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend made is a bit of gulit by association. You can try to instill proper attitude and good judgement, but at the end of the day, teenagers make upo their own minds.",
