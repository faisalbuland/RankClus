The grounding affected all V-22s, including the Corps' aircraft and the 11 CV-22s the Air Force operates, said Mike Welding, spokesman for the V-22 program at Navy Air Systems Command. As of Tuesday morning, 76 of the 84 aircraft had been cleared to fly,* with problems discovered on four Ospreys operated out of Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, by Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 266 out of Marine Corps Air Station New River, N.C. (...) An inspection revealed that four loose bolts had separated from a stationary swashplate trunnion and a gimbal ring on the drive tube, causing \"minor damage\" to the engine's pitch links and spinner support, he said. The swashplate has a rotating and stationary plate, and translates a pilot's commands to the rotors in motion. (...) All 11 CV-22s stationed at Hurlburt Field, Fla., were inspected and cleared to fly on Tuesday and had almost no effect on training operations, said Don Arias, an Air Force Special Operations Command spokesman. The Air Force has yet to deploy its CV-22s to Iraq. No V-22s have been deployed to Afghanistan, though Marine Commandant Gen. James Conway said the aircraft is \"made for Afghanistan\" and could be sent there later this year. No problems had been discovered on MV-22s in the U.S., which are based out of New River. Two of the four Ospreys with issues in Iraq had been repaired and cleared to fly, he said. The incident is the latest for the V-22, which has been considered a success in Iraq... (...)",

The grounding affected all V-22s, including the Corps' aircraft and the 11 CV-22s the Air Force operates, said Mike Welding, spokesman for the V-22 program at Navy Air Systems Command. As of Tuesday morning, 76 of the 84 aircraft had been cleared to fly,* with problems discovered on four Ospreys operated out of Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, by Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 266 out of Marine Corps Air Station New River, N.C. (...) An inspection revealed that four loose bolts had separated from a stationary swashplate trunnion and a gimbal ring on the drive tube, causing \"minor damage\" to the engine's pitch links and spinner support, he said. The swashplate has a rotating and stationary plate, and translates a pilot's commands to the rotors in motion. (...) All 11 CV-22s stationed at Hurlburt Field, Fla., were inspected and cleared to fly on Tuesday and had almost no effect on training operations, said Don Arias, an Air Force Special Operations Command spokesman. The Air Force has yet to deploy its CV-22s to Iraq. No V-22s have been deployed to Afghanistan, though Marine Commandant Gen. James Conway said the aircraft is \"made for Afghanistan\" and could be sent there later this year. No problems had been discovered on MV-22s in the U.S., which are based out of New River. Two of the four Ospreys with issues in Iraq had been repaired and cleared to fly, he said. The incident is the latest for the V-22, which has been considered a success in Iraq... (...)",

The grounding affected all V-22s, including the Corps' aircraft and the 11 CV-22s the Air Force operates, said Mike Welding, spokesman for the V-22 program at Navy Air Systems Command. As of Tuesday morning, 76 of the 84 aircraft had been cleared to fly,* with problems discovered on four Ospreys operated out of Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, by Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 266 out of Marine Corps Air Station New River, N.C. (...) An inspection revealed that four loose bolts had separated from a stationary swashplate trunnion and a gimbal ring on the drive tube, causing \"minor damage\" to the engine's pitch links and spinner support, he said. The swashplate has a rotating and stationary plate, and translates a pilot's commands to the rotors in motion. (...) All 11 CV-22s stationed at Hurlburt Field, Fla., were inspected and cleared to fly on Tuesday and had almost no effect on training operations, said Don Arias, an Air Force Special Operations Command spokesman. The Air Force has yet to deploy its CV-22s to Iraq. No V-22s have been deployed to Afghanistan, though Marine Commandant Gen. James Conway said the aircraft is \"made for Afghanistan\" and could be sent there later this year. No problems had been discovered on MV-22s in the U.S., which are based out of New River.
