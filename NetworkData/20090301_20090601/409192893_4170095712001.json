Wall Street Journal President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner received failing grades for their efforts to revive the economy from participants in the latest Wall Street Journal forecasting survey. Their assessment stands in stark contrast with Obama's popularity with the public, with a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll giving him a 60 percent approval rating. But a majority of the 49 economists polled is dissatisfied with the administration's economic policies. On average, they gave the president a mark of 59 out of 100, and although there was a broad range of marks, 42 percent of respondents graded Obama below 60. Geithner fared even worse, with an average grade of 51. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke scored better, with an average 71. \"The Obama team has blown it,\" said David Resler of Nomura Securities. Some economists were underwhelmed by the $787 billion stimulus package, with 43 percent saying the U.S. will need another stimulus package on the order of nearly $500 billion. Others were skeptical of the need for stimulus. \"The package already passed was too much too late,\" said Dana Johnson of Comerica Bank. However, economists' main complaint centers on the administration's plan for the banking sector. \"The most important issue in the short run is the financial rescue,\" said Stephen Stanley of RBS Greenwich Capital. \"They overpromised and underdelivered. Secretary Geithner scheduled a big speech and came out with just a vague blueprint. The uncertainty is hanging over everyone's head.\" Geithner unveiled the Obama administration's plans Feb. 10, but he offered few details, and stocks sank on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down almost 20 percent since the announcement, as multiple issues have weighed on investors' confidence. In the ensuing weeks, the Treasury secretary has appeared before Congress and offered more specifics but has said action on key parts of the plan still is weeks away. ----------------------------------------------- The Obama administration is a train wreck!",

Well, in order for something to have been done earlier, that means... BUSH would have had to have done something productive before he left office! But Bush essentially spent the last couple of months of his administration sitting on his hands while the economy was already in a nose-dive. So, if the argument is that it's TOO LATE, then don't look at Obama. This mess started under Bush, whose $152 BILLION stimulus package was a complete flop. quote: However, economists' main complaint centers on the administration's plan for the banking sector. \"The most important issue in the short run is the financial rescue,\" said Stephen Stanley of RBS Greenwich Capital. \"They overpromised and underdelivered.\"... Over-promised and under-delivered, huh? Well, when the Republican hold-outs are demanding bi-partisanship and screaming that everything costs too much or has too much pork, and they want to save the Bush tax cuts, and they don't want socialism but they want to nationalize this or bail-out that, and they're trying to create grid-lock with the Democrats who can't get their act together... If Obama delivers a Type A solution, the Republicans will throw a hissy fit. If Obama delivers a Type B solution, the Democrats will cry that it's not doing enough to help. So Obama tries to encourage a solution somewhere between, and nobody is happy. Last time I checked, this economic problem is global, it started years ago, and no matter how well-planned the countermeasures, no matter how brilliant the leader, it won't be fixed overnight. Our country is so accustomed to instant gratification - fast food, instant service, overnight delivery - that when a REAL challenge hits, and there's no immediate solution, they need to point fingers. All Obama can do is sign a bill once it passes the House and Senate. Until then, the train-wreck is the head-to-head collision between our two political ideologies clashing in Congress. Obama is far from perfect - he's a politician - but this is a bad situation where there's no perfect answer... only answers that help to pick up the pieces of an economy already shattered by eight years of stupidity.",

Very few people understand that there is no real difference between the 2 main parties. To many partisans with hard heads. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?\" - Joseph Stalin",
