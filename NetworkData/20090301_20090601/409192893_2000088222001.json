I do not mean \"Party\", because the parties of the present age have ruined this country. What I am referring to is something called an \"Independent Voters of America\" that could garner enough support, membership and capital ($$$) to boot these worthless, entrenched \"party\" synchophants out of D.C. and statehouses, and put the governance of this Nation back in the hands of \"We The People\" rather than \"Us the Party\"? The present system of \"Us the Party\" has this Nation in a virtual lock-down, because both sides refuse to cross the aisle due to the huge barrier that their individual party's ideology has erected. Points (pretty much) in fact: The majority of U.S. Citizens want illegal immigration stopped at the borders and ports of entry. Our \"leadership\" balks at doing this because of the minority votes they might lose, something like 12% I last read. Come election time, that is a huge figure when fighting for a majority vote, true. But what about the wishes of the other 88% the rest of the time? Many people in this country would prefer to *not* \"Press 1 for English\", but rather have it as the Official Language. Why has this not happened? See the above paragraph. I have paid into the Social Security system since my first printed paycheck back when I was 16 years old. Now that I am nearing full retirement, there is plenty of noise going around that my 40 year investment has been wasted elsewhere. Ummmm...Way to go, Congress! Does anyone else think this needs to be fixed? Both my kid and I had to go to the ER this past year. Even with insurance, the cost to me was high. But when we were at those visits, there were others in the same waiting room that needed help with speaking English and filling out forms. They had no insurance. Who pays for these people? That's right.....you and I do. Solution? First paragraph again. Millions of dollars are wasted annually in this state's (CA) school system because it is next to impossible to keep a student back from advancment due to failing grades. Instead, they are allowed to continue through the system in \"alternative\" programs. There is no incentive given for effort or self improvment. Yet, this state will also take a month's time to prepare for and administer tests which only grade and rank the school. In my school days, the final class grade from individual performance on the cirriculum is what the school's grading was based upon. U.S. industry is closing down and jobs going overseas. Products built and crafted by union shops are of inferior quality to those of non-union shops. Why? Because the unions will not allow thier members to be held accountable! I suppose I could \"Rant On\"... But tell me, military.com members....would a strong confederation of organized Independent Voters be able to get this Nation back in the hands of the People, rather than the major selfish parties?

In 1972 I ran for the House of Delegates in West Virginia. I was nominated, but lost in the General Election because I publically refused to support George McGovern, thus lost party backing and I lost the election by about 85 votes. Since that time I moved to Ohio (in 1976) and have changed parties several times, including one year 1976 as an independent. That was a bad move because I could not vote for any candidates, only issues. If a 'group' were formed to offset extreme right/extreme left it would make sense. However that has been my dream since 1972. Thanks for a great topic. I will cast no stones. Proud member of the RD-DV!
