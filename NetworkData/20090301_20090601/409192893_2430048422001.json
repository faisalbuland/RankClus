I suspect that the right balance of justices on SCOTUS will eventually throw DOMA out as violating the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment, though not by more than 5-4. You are correct, with one exception. It is not 14th amendment grounds on which it should obviously fail, but, rather, full faith and credit clause. The federal government cannot make a law instructing the states to ignore the laws of other states with regard to interstate commerce. For those here who disingenuously grouse that gay people should be happy with civil unions that are equal, I might remind two things: Firstly, one of the two of you is also publicly against civil unions as well; and, secondly, the civil unions of which you speak are intentionally rendered unequal by the very same law I talked about earlier, the horribly mis-titled DOMA.",

Just got off the phone with my mother, who spent the evening with her French club back in New Hampshire. The club is mostly older Catholics (my mother is one of the youngest), and the issue of gay marriage in NH came up. One of the older ladies said she wasn't too sure about switching from Civil Unions to Gay Marriage in NH. (By \"older,\" we mean she was probably around 80.) Two of the \"younger\" ladies (just over 60) proceeded to explain to her exactly why gays should have the right to be married under the law. These are all devout Catholics, living in a moderate-to-conservative area of a moderate state. So the stuff Cheney said was on the discussion board, as was Obama's declaration. I just find it amusing that these statements from these two men coincided this way. Hang in there, Bleah. It's getting better. Nobody wants it more than I do, but we'll get there. I'm not giving Obama a free pass. One thing at a time. Speaking for myself, he's a definite improvement over the last guy who declared that Pagan service members shouldn't even be allowed to practice their religion on military bases, and who wouldn't even address the issue of DADT other than to say that it was good enough",

You are correct, with one exception. It is not 14th amendment grounds on which it should obviously fail, but, rather, full faith and credit clause. The federal government cannot make a law instructing the states to ignore the laws of other states with regard to interstate commerce. For those here who disingenuously grouse that gay people should be happy with civil unions that are equal, I might remind two things: Firstly, one of the two of you is also publicly against civil unions as well; and, secondly, the civil unions of which you speak are intentionally rendered unequal by the very same law I talked about earlier, the horribly mis-titled DOMA.",

Just got off the phone with my mother, who spent the evening with her French club back in New Hampshire.

One of the older ladies said she wasn't too sure about switching from Civil Unions to Gay Marriage in NH. (By \"older,\" we mean she was probably around 80.) Two of the \"younger\" ladies (just over 60) proceeded to explain to her exactly why gays should have the right to be married under the law. These are all devout Catholics, living in a moderate-to-conservative area of a moderate state. So the stuff Cheney said was on the discussion board, as was Obama's declaration.

I'm not giving Obama a free pass. One thing at a time.
