Much as I admire those guys, that's proof (if true) that even WWII vets can be wrong about that war. There is no way, even if Patton was theoretically right, that we would have turned on the Russians in the spring of 1945. Politically it would have been a near impossibility. FDR had pretty much given away half of Europe at Yalta, and Stalin took him squarely to his word. Truman was finally able to get us going in the right direction in 1948, but for years was vilified for that. His reputation today is not what it was in the 1950s. Militarily it could not have been done. Historically the American people have not supported long wars--during the Civil War most were pretty much fed up by 1864, and by 1945 most Americans just wanted the fighting to end. They were determined to see the Germans and Japanese defeated but had no stomach for a war with the Russians. Five years later they got that war in Korea, and it was anything but popular. It's also worth noting that in 1945 the Russians had a strategic momentum that matched our own. By agreement they stopped at the Elbe River, but they easily could have pushed past that point. We had troops in Czechoslovakia. All things considered, the Russians were on the end of a much shorter and simpler logistical pipeline, and did not need to worry about political fallout. They were not vulnerable in 1945, Patton's overconfidence to the contrary. That wouldn't happen until at least another generation. It's also worth noting that Patton, for as much as he's revered, was a mere general--an army commander. He was not nearly as highly ranked as MacArthur, who Truman rightly fired for overstepping his mark. We do not have a history of generals riding to our rescue as such--George Washington was the exception to that rule and pretty much canceled out any Napoleon wannabes by resigning as President. The generals who followed him into the White House, Grant and Eisenhower, were not among our greatest presidents. Others who have aspired to that role, most notably George McClellan and Wesley Clark, were decidedly unsuited for it and were rejected by the voting public. Patton's war with Soviet Russia was fortunately just some idle comments on his part and impotent fantasies on the parts of others. History has pretty much demonstrated that the Soviet Union was not viable and could not survive, but that it had to collapse on its own. This was very costly in terms of human lives, but a premature war might well have been even costlier. What's tragic is that, almost twenty years after the destruction of the Berlin Wall, the ideology that built that murderous barrier is still thriving. How many more dead will we need to count before that discredited utopian nightmare is finally laid in its rightful grave...?",
