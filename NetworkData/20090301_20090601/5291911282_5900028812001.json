        "content": "This was reported in the Cincinnati news today' U.S. Customs agents say they've stopped a massive shipment of weapons from entering the United States through the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport. Customs and Border Patrol agents made the seizure yesterday. The shipment, manifested as \"Toys\" was valued at $14,000 and shipped in 25 boxes from Istanbul, Turkey. Agents decided to search the boxes after it was determined the weapons had arrived without the proper permits. They found 60 pump action 12-gauge shotguns and 177 pistols. The shotguns were encased in Styrofoam molding and individually packaged in 12 large boxes. The pistols were shipped within hard plastic gun storage cases packed inside 13 large cardboard boxes. The guns were destined for a business located in Kentucky. Neither the shotguns nor pistols were found to have any serial numbers or markings. Agents say this is the largest seizure of weapons ever made by CBP in Cincinnati. I am all in favor of rights to own guns and own guns myself but it worrys me that guns are shipped into this country labeled as \"toys\" and without serial numbers.",
