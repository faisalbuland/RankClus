Well, has it occurred to anyone that he does not need to use the legislative process in order to restrict people from exercising their 2nd amendment right? There is a little thing called a treaty which can make this process much easier for Obama to reach these aims. All that is needed for a treaty to become law (and thus part of our Constitution) is it to pass the Senate. With the Senate very close to having 60 Democratic seats (enough to prevent a Republican filibuster), that probably will not be very hard to do. And, one high priority of the Obama admin is to pass CIFTA. The passing of CIFTA would essentially do what the Democrats have been wanting to do for years. So, if you support the 2nd amendment, I highly recommend that you start contacting your Senators now.",

The \"states\" in that proposed treaty are nations in the Western Hemisphere. What it proposes to do is to combat the transfer of illegal weapons between the countries which sign on.
