General Growth Properties, who operates 158 malls across the US, filed for Chapter 11 last Thursday. But, you wouldn't know it if you watch Fox, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC or CBS. You also wouldn't know this if you read much of the newspapers across the country. This is huge news! This marks the beginning of the commercial real-estate collapse that many have said will happen. This market represents a huge chunk of the real-estate assets that all of the banks hold. And, this is only the beginning. Oh yeah, let us not forget that NOD's (Notices of Default) are at their all time high levels, surpassing that of those seen in the first residential real estate crash. So, that means that the second wave of the residential real-estate crash is going to happen in about 4-6 months. Yet, none of this is in the news. The news media is trying to paint a snowing white picture when things could not be more dark than they are today.",

The news media is trying to paint a snowing white picture when things could not be more dark than they are today. I have heard this story from several sources and NPR did a detailed story INCLUDING interviews. This company was leveraged to the max from borrowing a LOT to grow and was having trouble BEFORE the recession. This may not be in the news, except maybe in the business section, because it is not a surprise when a buiness having trouble BEFORE the recession fails during the recession.

Most of the sources that I found it on were smaller news sites. I shouldn't have to dig and search for news this big, this could be the start of the Commercial Real-Estate crash. Also, like I said, NODs spiked to their highest levels ever over the past month due to the moratorium on foreclosures being lifted in March.",
