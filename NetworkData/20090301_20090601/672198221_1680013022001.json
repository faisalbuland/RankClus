        "content": "EX-FBI Director Louis J Freeh has told a broadcaster that $2bn paid by BAE Systems into US bank accounts controlled by former Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, was not a bribe. Instead, he said it was part of a bartering process which involved the exchange of Saudi oil for British fighter jets. And he says the oil-for-weapons deal allowed by the British and Saudi governments under a treaty signed in 1985 included an Airbus 340, which Prince Bandar used for private transport for several years. The United States Justice Department has been probing the transfer of funds to accounts at Riggs Bank in Washington DC, as part of an international corruption investigation involving BAE Systems. Mr Freeh, who is now a lawyer and consultant for Bandar, was appearing in a documentary for the US's Public Broadcasting Service. Prince Bandar, who was Saudi ambassador to America from 1983 to 2005, has denied any wrongdoing. He is now a national security advisor to Saudi's King Abdullah. Mr Freeh, FBI director from 1993 to 2001, said that under a treaty signed in 1985, Britain and Saudi Arabia agreed to the trade of oil for weapons. He said BAE signed an $86bn contract with the Saudis under the provisions of the treaty, and funds that flowed between Britain and bank accounts under Prince Bandar's control may have come from the sale of Saudi oil under the terms of the contract. As part of the deal, BAE also supplied an Airbus 340, which for years has been used by Prince Bandar, but is actually the property of the Saudi Air Force. US government officials said the investigation was being conducted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which has jurisdiction over business executives making bribes but not the government officials receiving them so Prince Bandar would not be the target of the Department's investigation. According to the Los Angeles Times, Freeh's consulting firm, Freeh Group International, dismissed the bribery allegations, saying that \"not only have both these reckless allegations not been proved in any court or fair factual forum, but neither has been the subject of any charge or official government accusation.\" A BAE statement read: \"BAE Systems' view is that the interests of the company as well as of all its stakeholders, including the general public, are best served by allowing these investigations to run their course. The company is working with regulators towards that end, with a view to achieving resolution of the ongoing investigations.\" Prince Bandar was a the centre of the BAE bribery probe by the English Serious Fraud Squad which was ordered to be dropped by the British government, after representations from the Saudi Royal family. It was believed the Saudi government threatened to withdraw its assistance in the global war on terror. \"\"\"http://www.nwemail.co.uk/home/ex__fbi_director_refutes_bae_bribe_claim_1_537479?referrerPath=home/models\"\"\" some list of how big these guys are BAE Systems Receives $35.3 Million Award for Outer Tactical Vest from Defense Logistics Agency BAE Systems has been awarded a $6.3 million Air Force contract to develop better mechanisms to warn and protect satellites against attack. BAE Systems has been preparing to transfer advanced technology to Saudi Arabia as part of the nearly $9 billion Eurofighter Typhoon project. BAE Systems admits to ethical failings as investigations into corruption continue BAE Systems, the arms giant accused of making corrupt payments worldwide to win lucrative contracts, has admitted it acted unethically in the past. The admissions were made by BAE executives to Lord Woolf, the former lord chief justice, who was hired by the company to review its conduct. BAE promised to improve its behaviour when seeking to win future contracts. Britain's biggest defence company had been forced to hire Woolf last summer after it suffered bad publicity over corruption allegations. There had been an outcry after Tony Blair's government halted a Serious Fraud Office investigation into allegations of huge bribes in a Saudi arms deal. That deal is being investigated by the US Department of Justice and is the subject of a House of Lords appeal. BAE is also being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over claims it paid bribes to secure contracts in a number of other countries, including Tanzania and the Czech Republic. Woolf published his report yesterday, in which he said the allegations had directly damaged BAE's reputation, and had \"cast a shadow of suspicion and doubt\" over the company. He added that BAE was \"overly secretive, defensive, unwilling to explain its actions and, at best, lukewarm to the challenge of dealing with the major reputational issues affecting the company and industry\". He said that during his review Mike Turner, BAE's outgoing chief executive, and Dick Olver, the company's chairman, had conceded BAE \"did not in the past pay sufficient attention to ethical standards and avoid activities that had the potential to give rise to reputational damage\". Woolf set out 23 recommendations, which he said formed a \"road-map\" for BAE to \"ensure higher standards of ethical business conduct\". In response, Turner said: \"We will carefully study the report's contents to understand the detail of its conclusions and remain committed to acting on all its recommendations\", while Olver said Woolf's report was \"an important step towards BAE's objective of achieving benchmark standards of governance in the conduct of its day-to-day business\". However, Woolf has been accused of producing a \"whitewash\" for a company desperate to improve its public image - a claim he rejected yesterday. When he agreed to do the job, he accepted BAE's terms that he would not investigate the details of allegedly corrupt deals of the past, nor BAE's system of making secret payments to middlemen through offshore accounts. Woolf said: \"If they were looking for somebody to go and look through these old allegations, I wasn't the person for the job. I'm not a policeman, I have not got the skills to fill that. And what I was interested in was helping BAE ... to set standards in global companies which meet the highest ethical standards, because that's important for the reputation of this company.\" He gave a clean bill of health to the \"Salam project\", BAE's latest multibillion-pound deal to sell Typhoon combat aircraft to the Saudis, as he deemed it to be current. Woolf said \"security obligations\" prevented access to some relevant documentation on the contract but, on the basis of the information given by BAE, the contract \"should not in itself create any risks of unethical conduct by the company\". BAE had told Woolf it had not employed any middlemen to land the contract. In all, BAE paid \u00a31.7m for the report, which included payments to Woolf and three committee members and various administration costs. Woolf's recommendations, which were criticised for being light on detail, include the creation of a more proactive ethics board, the nomination of an executive to champion ethics, and greater monitoring of gifts and hospitality. He suggested the appointment of middlemen - who are frequently used to funnel bribes to foreign politicians and officials - should be subjected to greater scrutiny, so that there are \"demonstrably no risks of actual or apparent corruption of any kind\". Woolf also urged ministers to bring into force much tougher legislation to outlaw bribery, as Britain has been repeatedly criticised for failing to prosecute any company for making corrupt payments overseas. \"\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/may/07 /bae.armstrade\"",
