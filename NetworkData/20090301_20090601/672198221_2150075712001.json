The \"Speak softly and carry a big kick\" ticket ;-) Chuck (and those foolish enough to follow him) have apparently forgotten how things turned out the last time a group of states decided to try and secede - they got their azzes handed to them, and lost a few cities due to them being burned to the ground by the victorious Union armies. If they were dumb enough to try it again, the beating they would get would be even more lopsided, and we'd spend years watching FLIR/night vision footage of them being hunted down like the Taliban just before a JDAM or Hellfire is dropped down on top of them. Not to mention that I doubt the Union would be anywhere near as kind to them a second time around come surrender time.

        "reply": " Chuck (and those foolish enough to follow him) have apparently forgotten how things turned out the last time a group of states decided to try and secede - they got their azzes handed to them, and lost a few cities due to them being burned to the ground by the victorious Union armies. If they were dumb enough to try it again, the beating they would get would be even more lopsided, and we'd spend years watching FLIR/night vision footage of them being hunted down like the Taliban just before a JDAM or Hellfire is dropped down on top of them. Not to mention that I doubt the Union would be anywhere near as kind to them a second time around come surrender time. Is getting your panties in a wad over an election that didn't go your way worth all that trouble and destruction?",

If they were dumb enough to try it again, the beating they would get would be even more lopsided, and we'd spend years watching FLIR/night vision footage of them being hunted down like the Taliban just before a JDAM or Hellfire is dropped down on top of them.
