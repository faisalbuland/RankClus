My lack of experience, my questionable ethics, my monstrous ego, and my association with evil doers are of no consequence. For I shall save you with Hope and Change. Go, therefore, and proclaim throughout the land that he who preceded me is evil, that he has defiled the nation, and that all he has built must be destroyed.\u201d And the people rejoiced. For even though they knew not what The One would do, He had promised that it was good; and they believed. And The One said \u201cWe live in the greatest country in the world.

Then a citizen asked, \u201cWith no foreign relations experience and having zero military experience or knowledge, how will you deal with radical terrorists?\u201d And The One said, \u201cSimple. I shall sit with them and talk with them and show them how nice we really are; and they will forget that they ever wanted to kill us all!\u201d And the people said, \u201cHallelujah!! We are safe at last, and we can beat our weapons into free cars for the people!\u201d Then The One said, \u201cI shall give 95% of you lower taxes.\u201d And one, lone voice said, \u201cBut 40% of us don\u2019t pay ANY taxes.\u201d So The One said, \u201cThen I shall give you some of the taxes the fat-cats pay!\u201d And the people said, \u201cHallelujah!! Show us the money!\u201d Then The One said, \u201cI shall tax your Capital Gains when you sell your homes!\u201d And the people yawned and the slumping housing market collapsed.
