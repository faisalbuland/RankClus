        "content": "this is a letter sent ot Obama et al this week: On March 26th, during an on line forum, I heard President Obama respond to a question regarding the government trying to return jobs to America by corporations who outsourced overseas. His response said, no he did not want to return the low paying jobs to America, but wanted to create new jobs. Unfortunately, the President neglected to address the high or mid-level paid technology jobs that disappeared to India and other countries over the past 10 years. Please consider that when Dell outsourced the call center tech jobs overseas, these jobs paid Americans around 90 to 100k per year, losing the earning power by those Americans who now had to take low paying jobs to replace these they lost. Other jobs, such as medical transcription paid a living wage to Americans, but were outsourced. Transcriptionists for the most part earn less than most other minimum wage jobs, yet require technical expertise in the medical fields. Technology manufacturing jobs, which were not considered low pay also, were outsourced. These were jobs supporting American families. Now the complete picture here is this: the jobs were outsourced, paying a much lower salary to overseas workers. Consequently, one would believe the American consumer would reap the benefit of lower cost production, but this is not always true. Outsourcing does not necessarily lower the overall cost of the products made to the American consumer, but instead increased the profit margins for these corporations. When corporations can post a profit of billions each quarter, someone is paying the price. Thus, the wealth does not trickle down to the American worker/consumer. The greed of the wealthy has created this warped imbalance in our economy, and as much as I hate to admit it, we need to balance it out by making it more difficult for the wealthy to hold on to as much profit as they have been able to do in the past 25 years. \u201cTrickle down\u201d only made it easier to hold on to immense wealth. Government de regulation and union busting also contributed, as there was little aid for the American worker to maintain a livable income. I personally, make less now than I did in 1995! In addition, with inflation, this means a tremendous loss of purchase power for a low-income person. President Obama cited all kinds of reasons for the budget being so big, and attributed most of it to aid for the poor and elderly. Wrong again, I say. The reasons for an imbalance are the greed and government bailing out the rich and powerful, and trying to create a slave class again by eliminating the working class. When the workers have no say in the work they do, when they must work for less than a living wage while the wealthy continue to take the profits off the workers toils, it is slavery, plain and simple. This is what I believe is the challenge for this government. Instead of bailing out the greedy mis-managed corporations, allow them to fail, send the money back into the working class. New business will arise from the ashes of the old and hopefully will have learned what not to do. I believe that Roosevelt had to do the same thing in creating a new deal for working class Americans in the 30\u2019s, or face a massive revolutionary working class uprising. It still could happen today. This is the argument missed in all these discussions. They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.

The reality is we are all to blame, at least, all of us who had a 401k, owned stock, or had a retirement plan based upon the market. When the sun was shining and the stocks were up, we didn't care about how the money was invested, or whether the fund was well run or not. The only thing that mattered to us was the general market increase and the value of our investments (a fleeting measure, but one that many set in their minds). Well, now the bluff has been called and your retirement fund, your house, land, and any other real property isn't worth what you THOUGHT it was. Note the emphasis on 'thought'- real worth is at the point of sale, not the estimated value. unless you are selling, your investments have no real value, only an 'estimation'. Did you ever attend a stockholders' meeting? Ever voice your concerns when the market was 'up'? Then don't complain when there is a downturn. If you didn't see it coming, why do you expect them to see it? Next time, watch your money when you invest it. If you don't know how it's being used, you're setting yourself up for another nasty surprise. The solution? Patience. The market will rebound. The other solution to future investment is wisdom. Get it or lose money. It's as simple as that. As for outsourcing, it is a fact of the market. There will ALWAYS be an effort to trim operational costs, whether that is going overseas or not. The reason for it is the relative value of the jobs being outsourced are falling rapidly. If this is your industry, you're in a losing game with a bad hand. Rather than rage against the change, it's time to change jobs. Oh, and if you're making less than you did in 1995, you're about 10 years late in finding a new job skill. Either evolve or die poor. I've had four different jobs in two distinct fields since 1995, and I'm making just about twice what I did in 1995. Sullivan013",

        "content": "this is a letter sent ot Obama et al this week: On March 26th, during an on line forum, I heard President Obama respond to a question regarding the government trying to return jobs to America by corporations who outsourced overseas. His response said, no he did not want to return the low paying jobs to America, but wanted to create new jobs. Unfortunately, the President neglected to address the high or mid-level paid technology jobs that disappeared to India and other countries over the past 10 years. Please consider that when Dell outsourced the call center tech jobs overseas, these jobs paid Americans around 90 to 100k per year, losing the earning power by those Americans who now had to take low paying jobs to replace these they lost. Other jobs, such as medical transcription paid a living wage to Americans, but were outsourced. Transcriptionists for the most part earn less than most other minimum wage jobs, yet require technical expertise in the medical fields. Technology manufacturing jobs, which were not considered low pay also, were outsourced. These were jobs supporting American families. Now the complete picture here is this: the jobs were outsourced, paying a much lower salary to overseas workers. Consequently, one would believe the American consumer would reap the benefit of lower cost production, but this is not always true. Outsourcing does not necessarily lower the overall cost of the products made to the American consumer, but instead increased the profit margins for these corporations. When corporations can post a profit of billions each quarter, someone is paying the price. Thus, the wealth does not trickle down to the American worker/consumer. The greed of the wealthy has created this warped imbalance in our economy, and as much as I hate to admit it, we need to balance it out by making it more difficult for the wealthy to hold on to as much profit as they have been able to do in the past 25 years. \u201cTrickle down\u201d only made it easier to hold on to immense wealth. Government de regulation and union busting also contributed, as there was little aid for the American worker to maintain a livable income. I personally, make less now than I did in 1995! In addition, with inflation, this means a tremendous loss of purchase power for a low-income person. President Obama cited all kinds of reasons for the budget being so big, and attributed most of it to aid for the poor and elderly. Wrong again, I say. The reasons for an imbalance are the greed and government bailing out the rich and powerful, and trying to create a slave class again by eliminating the working class. When the workers have no say in the work they do, when they must work for less than a living wage while the wealthy continue to take the profits off the workers toils, it is slavery, plain and simple. This is what I believe is the challenge for this government. Instead of bailing out the greedy mis-managed corporations, allow them to fail, send the money back into the working class. New business will arise from the ashes of the old and hopefully will have learned what not to do. I believe that Roosevelt had to do the same thing in creating a new deal for working class Americans in the 30\u2019s, or face a massive revolutionary working class uprising. It still could happen today. This is the argument missed in all these discussions. They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.

I believe that Roosevelt had to do the same thing in creating a new deal for working class Americans in the 30\u2019s, or face a massive revolutionary working class uprising. It still could happen today. This is the argument missed in all these discussions. They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.

        "content": "What gets me about this crisis is the 'witchunt' mentality trying to lay blame on some specific group of people who 'caused' our current problem. The reality is we are all to blame, at least, all of us who had a 401k, owned stock, or had a retirement plan based upon the market. When the sun was shining and the stocks were up, we didn't care about how the money was invested, or whether the fund was well run or not. The only thing that mattered to us was the general market increase and the value of our investments (a fleeting measure, but one that many set in their minds). Well, now the bluff has been called and your retirement fund, your house, land, and any other real property isn't worth what you THOUGHT it was. Note the emphasis on 'thought'- real worth is at the point of sale, not the estimated value. unless you are selling, your investments have no real value, only an 'estimation'. Did you ever attend a stockholders' meeting? Ever voice your concerns when the market was 'up'? Then don't complain when there is a downturn. If you didn't see it coming, why do you expect them to see it? Next time, watch your money when you invest it. If you don't know how it's being used, you're setting yourself up for another nasty surprise. The solution? Patience. The market will rebound. The other solution to future investment is wisdom. Get it or lose money. It's as simple as that. As for outsourcing, it is a fact of the market. There will ALWAYS be an effort to trim operational costs, whether that is going overseas or not. The reason for it is the relative value of the jobs being outsourced are falling rapidly. If this is your industry, you're in a losing game with a bad hand. Rather than rage against the change, it's time to change jobs. Oh, and if you're making less than you did in 1995, you're about 10 years late in finding a new job skill. Either evolve or die poor. I've had four different jobs in two distinct fields since 1995, and I'm making just about twice what I did in 1995. Sullivan013",
