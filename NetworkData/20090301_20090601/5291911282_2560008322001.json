Thank you for serving, and welcome to the family! \"Sapper\" can mean many things depending on the context, but it typically denotes one person (or group thereof, vis-a-vis \"sapperS\") that infiltrate something, eg: a building, a position, enemy lines, etc. In the military, a sapper is someone who infiltrates enemy lines. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

I did not know this - I knew that CE's were sometimes referred to as sappers, but I thought it was derogatory if used by another MOS. Still, never knew WHY, nor did I know that the British CE's. Very, very interesting. Thanks! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
