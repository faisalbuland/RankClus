The taxes would pay for only a fraction of the cost to expand health-insurance coverage to all Americans and would face strong opposition from the beverage industry. They also could spark a backlash from consumers who would have to pay several cents more for a soft drink. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee is set to hear proposals from about a dozen experts about how to pay for the comprehensive health-care overhaul that President Barack Obama wants to enact this year. Early estimates put the cost of the plan at around $1.2 trillion. The administration has so far only earmarked funds for about half of that amount. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based watchdog group that pressures food companies to make healthier products, plans to propose a federal excise tax on soda, certain fruit drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. It would not include most diet beverages. Excise taxes are levied on goods and manufacturers typically pass them on to consumers. Senior staff members for some Democratic senators at the center of the effort to craft health-care legislation are weighing the idea behind closed doors, Senate aides said. The more we \"ask\" the government to help us the more we allow them to take control over our lives. I would rather work two jobs to pay for my health care than allow the government to tell me what I can and can not do by taxing things to the point where they can no longer be enjoyed.",

I think people should have the right to smoke if they want, but I should have the right to not be around it. So, you wont like this , but I am happy that people can't smoke in public places. That is not to say I want all places non smoking. If a place allowed smoking, I just would know not to go to there. Or if a plane allowed smoking, I would know to pick the non smoking flight etc",

I run five days a week to allow me the opportunity to eat what I want, when I want. I am currently training for a marathon and I drink soda to keep weight on. Should I be penalized for drinking soda because I am exercising too much? Once we \"accept\" encroachment on our rights due to increased taxation it will continue to grow. First it was cigarettes and alcohol. Now sugary drinks are being proposed. Next it will be fast food and food with excessive amounts of sugar. Where will it end? The problem is that it probably won't end.",

Her idea of dessert is one oreo cookie. My wife and I taught her these habits, not some hack politician. When I became overweight, I dieted and exercised my way back into good health. I run five days a week to allow me the opportunity to eat what I want, when I want. I am currently training for a marathon and I drink soda to keep weight on. Should I be penalized for drinking soda because I am exercising too much? Once we \"accept\" encroachment on our rights due to increased taxation it will continue to grow. First it was cigarettes and alcohol. Now sugary drinks are being proposed. Next it will be fast food and food with excessive amounts of sugar. Where will it end? The problem is that it probably won't end.",

The taxes would pay for only a fraction of the cost to expand health-insurance coverage to all Americans and would face strong opposition from the beverage industry. They also could spark a backlash from consumers who would have to pay several cents more for a soft drink. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee is set to hear proposals from about a dozen experts about how to pay for the comprehensive health-care overhaul that President Barack Obama wants to enact this year. Early estimates put the cost of the plan at around $1.2 trillion. The administration has so far only earmarked funds for about half of that amount. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based watchdog group that pressures food companies to make healthier products, plans to propose a federal excise tax on soda, certain fruit drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. It would not include most diet beverages. Excise taxes are levied on goods and manufacturers typically pass them on to consumers. Senior staff members for some Democratic senators at the center of the effort to craft health-care legislation are weighing the idea behind closed doors, Senate aides said. The more we \"ask\" the government to help us the more we allow them to take control over our lives. I would rather work two jobs to pay for my health care than allow the government to tell me what I can and can not do by taxing things to the point where they can no longer be enjoyed.",

        "content": "Hi Ol Doc That is a good point you made about the smoking tax going to the area it offends. But wouldn't you have to open that up to include all types of smoke related issues? It is not only the addict that suffers from smoking issues, second hand smoking was a huge issue too. I think people should have the right to smoke if they want, but I should have the right to not be around it. So, you wont like this , but I am happy that people can't smoke in public places. That is not to say I want all places non smoking. If a place allowed smoking, I just would know not to go to there. Or if a plane allowed smoking, I would know to pick the non smoking flight etc",

We do have a problem with being over weight in this country that is for sure. It is the children I worry about. It is a shame that people have to eat the fast food and processed food because it is cheaper. I think everyone that has room should grow a garden as a family project and get back to basics. I am working on mine now. But if the government puts a tax on sugar drinks then they will have to go after the fast food industry. I don't want government running my life that is for sure. The question is, did making smoking so expensive help some people to stop? Will it stop people from drinking pop or eating fast food? In Europe they were trying to get people to stop using the plastic bags at the store, they could have just fined the store for not selling paper, but instead, they just made the cutomer pay more for the plastic to encourage people to start using the cloth shopping bags. That theory seems to work a little. I know lots of people that said they stopped smoking because it was just too expensive. And I saw most of the people shopping at the market in England using the cloth bags. Just a thought. Yes the cigarette tax is working, at least in Oregon. That doesn't mean I like it. It is a regressive tax targeted specifically at addicts, such as myself. If the money went specifically for lung cancer research and treatment there might be a justification but it doesn't. That being said, it seems to have had a significant impact on the number of smokers in this state. It's kind of like torture, is it ok if it works? That's part of my point Doc. Once folks such as myself quit smoking because of the tax increase, they will need to get their money elsewhere for their healthcare funding. WHen will it stop. Alcohol is next. Beer tax and liquor tax is the next agenda. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns.

What ever happened to making personal choices and sacrifices due to needs, wants, and personal responsibility? My six year old daughter does not drink soda. She does not eat candy. Her idea of dessert is one oreo cookie. My wife and I taught her these habits, not some hack politician. When I became overweight, I dieted and exercised my way back into good health. I run five days a week to allow me the opportunity to eat what I want, when I want. I am currently training for a marathon and I drink soda to keep weight on. Should I be penalized for drinking soda because I am exercising too much? Once we \"accept\" encroachment on our rights due to increased taxation it will continue to grow. First it was cigarettes and alcohol. Now sugary drinks are being proposed. Next it will be fast food and food with excessive amounts of sugar. Where will it end? The problem is that it probably won't end.",
