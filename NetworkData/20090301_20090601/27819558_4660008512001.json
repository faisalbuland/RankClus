It makes it a Federal offense to disclose your orientation if you happen to be gay. Get a grip on the law. The law discourages gays from joining or remaining in the service if it does anything at all, along with disrupting unit cohesion when one does get booted out for not being the military approved of sexual orientation. And you and = want to force gays to revel their sexual orientation once DA/DT is withdrawn as LAW in order to make sure it discourages homosexual orientated people from joining. What a crazy notion! You sneaky fundamentalist!",

I've been getting up at 10AM, have a cup or two of coffee and then walk the dogs. By the time I get home it's lunch time and after eating I take a nap, usually awaking around 4PM just in time to watch Judge Judy. At 5PM I try to do a little yard work and then get ready for dinner. The rest of the evening is spent on here so I'm really pressed for available reading time!!! I suppose I could give up Judge Judy but it will be difficult (BG). I'll find the time somewhere...",
