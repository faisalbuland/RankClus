Bring on the Nuancers 'http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/10/study-pelosi-repeated-requests-military-aircraft/' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly requested military aircraft to shuttle her and her colleagues and family around the country, according to a new report from a conservative watchdog group. Representatives for Judicial Watch, which obtained e-mails and other documents from a Freedom of Information request, said the correspondence shows Pelosi has abused the system in place to accommodate congressional leaders and treated the Air Force as her \"personal airline.\" The e-mails showed repeated attempts by Pelosi aides to request aircraft, sometimes aggressively, and by Department of Defense officials to accommodate them. \"I think that's above and beyond what other members of Congress are doing and what is expected of our elected officials,\" said Jenny Small, a researcher with the group. The group reported that Pelosi was notorious for making special demands for high-end aircraft, lodging last-minute cancellations, and racking up additional expenses for the military. In one e-mail, aide Kay King complained to the military that they had not made available any aircraft the House speaker wanted for Memorial Day recess. \"It is my understanding there are NO G5s available for the House during the Memorial Day recess. This is totally unacceptable ... The Speaker will want to know where the planes are,\" King wrote. In another, when told a certain type of aircraft would not be available, King wrote: \"This is not good news, and we will have some very disappointed folks, as well as a very upset Speaker.\" Pelosi's office has not yet responded to requests for comment.",

Representatives for Judicial Watch, which obtained e-mails and other documents from a Freedom of Information request, said the correspondence shows Pelosi has abused the system in place to accommodate congressional leaders and treated the Air Force as her \"personal airline.\" The e-mails showed repeated attempts by Pelosi aides to request aircraft, sometimes aggressively, and by Department of Defense officials to accommodate them. \"I think that's above and beyond what other members of Congress are doing and what is expected of our elected officials,\" said Jenny Small, a researcher with the group. The group reported that Pelosi was notorious for making special demands for high-end aircraft, lodging last-minute cancellations, and racking up additional expenses for the military. In one e-mail, aide Kay King complained to the military that they had not made available any aircraft the House speaker wanted for Memorial Day recess. \"It is my understanding there are NO G5s available for the House during the Memorial Day recess. This is totally unacceptable ... The Speaker will want to know where the planes are,\" King wrote.

Representatives for Judicial Watch, which obtained e-mails and other documents from a Freedom of Information request, said the correspondence shows Pelosi has abused the system in place to accommodate congressional leaders and treated the Air Force as her \"personal airline.\" The e-mails showed repeated attempts by Pelosi aides to request aircraft, sometimes aggressively, and by Department of Defense officials to accommodate them. \"I think that's above and beyond what other members of Congress are doing and what is expected of our elected officials,\" said Jenny Small, a researcher with the group. The group reported that Pelosi was notorious for making special demands for high-end aircraft, lodging last-minute cancellations, and racking up additional expenses for the military. In one e-mail, aide Kay King complained to the military that they had not made available any aircraft the House speaker wanted for Memorial Day recess. \"It is my understanding there are NO G5s available for the House during the Memorial Day recess. This is totally unacceptable ... The Speaker will want to know where the planes are,\" King wrote.

Hastert used a C-20, the military version of the Gulf Stream 3 business jet, a twin-engine turbo-fan aircraft that seats 12 passengers with a crew of five. I left that out, dont think so. You left this out. The sources, who include those in Congress and in the administration, said the Democrat is seeking regular military flights not only for herself and her staff, but also for relatives and for other members of the California delegation. A knowledgeable source called the request \"carte blanche for an aircraft any time.\" \"They are pressing the point of her succession and that the [Department of Defense] needs to play ball with the speaker's needs,\" one source said. The request originally went to the Pentagon, which then asked the White House to weigh in. Mrs. Pelosi's request is not new for a speaker, who is second-in-line in presidential succession. A defense source said the speaker's regular access to a military plane began after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Rep. J. Dennis Hastert, Illinois Republican, who was speaker at the time, started using U.S. Air Force planes for domestic travel to and from his district for security reasons. A former Hastert aide said the congressman did not use military planes for political trips or regularly transport his family. The defense source said Mr. Hastert requested a plane with good communications so he could conduct legislative business. The military flights increased to the point the speaker used a military plane for many, if not all, flights to his Illinois district, the former aide said. Sources said Mrs. Pelosi's request goes beyond what Mr. Hastert received. The speaker's legal counsel is spearheading the talks. 'http://archives.californiaaviation.org/legislative/msg09264.html' It started out with good intension and she has been abusing it. She started by requesting a larger ACFT. If you thinks its ok to abuse the AF by trying to get her planes on demand by intimidation then so be it. I think its a waste of taxpayer money no matter who it is. Besides arent dems always saying that we werent attacked because the terrorist dont want to, not because we are safer. So terrorist arent a threat anymore she can hop her azz on delta. She has 90k for misc expenses.",

It has nothing to do with party. The practice started with Hastert right after 9/11. He is a republican. Do you have a reference for this kind of abuse? Or is this just more of the same old \"I know you are but what am I?\" four year old response?",
