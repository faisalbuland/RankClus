As NSPreitler said, my understanding is that the reason AIG is in trouble is because it was the insurer of approximately $500 billion in credit default swaps (i.e., an insurer of risky mortgages). Throughout the last decade, most of AIG's business was as a typical, profitable insurance company (home and auto insurance, etc.), subject to regulation and required to maintain adequate capital reserves to pay any claims. The problem is that they also developed a completely unregulated side business insuring the high-risk mortgages of the last decades, writing contracts worth a half trillion dollars without hardly any reserves to cover claims. For several years, as property values rose, they had few if any claims. When the housing market collapsed, hundreds of billions of dollars in claims arose and AIG had no money set aside to cover them. The rest of AIG remained profitable, but this one business sank the company. Shutting down AIG completely would leave homeowners, drivers, injured auto accident victims, etc. without coverage. While state insurance guaranty associations offer some coverage in the event of failed insurance companies, the state plans often do not fully cover losses. However, rather than pumping endless funds into AIG, I wonder why the government cannot simply offer to fully or partially guaranty the policies issued under the regulated portion of AIG's business (auto insurance, home insurance, etc.). These policyholders (and their victims) are innocent victims of AIG's collapse: they did the right thing, buying insurance from a well-known, regulated insurance company. In contrast, I don't see any need for the federal government to guarantee policies issued under the unregulated part of AIG's business (credit default insurance). These policyholders were sophisticated banks and financial institutions who knew (or should have known) they were investing in high-risk mortgage instruments and purchasing totally unregulated insurance. It would be a lot less expensive for the federal government to insure the occasional serious auto accident or fire loss covered by an AIG policy than to plunge hundreds of billions of dollars into trying to protect a company and its financial customers from the consequences of their own recklessness. (There are innocent victims even at AIG. The people who sold and paid claims in AIG's traditional insurance lines ran a profitable business, and it is not their fault the company failed. Unfortunately, one division ran amok and brought down the entire enterprise.",
