I was walking north west past the above identified Duplex and Apartment. I was squarely in the middle of the sidewalk, just passing the south apartment when a young man opened the door and allowed a large black Doberman Pincer to exit the door without a leash. As soon as the dog hit the porch, it saw me and immediately charged all the way to me on the sidewalk barking and snarling fiercely. I immediately placed my walking stick between the dog and my legs and began yelling for the man to call his dog back to the porch. Over the noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway and the fierce growling and barking of the dog, I could not be certain whether he called for the dog or not. He made no effort to come and get the dog and pull it back at all. The dog lunged towards me twice, and both times, I kept the dog away from me with my walking stick. The man had not left the porch at that time. Suddenly the dog tried to lunge under my stick to my right leg. At that time, I gave the dog a solid rap on the right side of the snout, which sent it reeling and yelping, and it finally retreated away from me. At the time the man, a young male of about 30, about 5\"10\" 220 lbs stocky broad build short cropped hair with thin goatee and mustache, came charging off the porch after me. I raised my walking stick port arms with both hands and yelled for him to back off, which he did not do. He grabbed my walking stick with both hands and tried to jerk it away, but I refused to surrender it holding on with all my might. Several more times, he tried to twist it away or jerk it away . I told him several times to back off and let go of my stick. His words were, \"Let go of your stick!? I ought to kick you ass!!\" among other curses and threats. He then proceeded to drive me backwards from the sidewalk across the lawn into the center of the street, continually trying to wrench my stick from my hands. At this point, I was hanging on for fear if he got it away, he would strike me with it. I again told him to back off and let go of my stick. I am 59 in June and have numerous health problems for heart trouble and back surgery to recent shoulder and stomach surgery, so about the best I could do was stay solid on that stick and hope he wouldn't start trying to kick me. He neither stuck nor kicked me at any time. Oh yeh - it's been a fun day - ahey Wandering and Wondering",

I was walking north west past the above identified Duplex and Apartment. I was squarely in the middle of the sidewalk, just passing the south apartment when a young man opened the door and allowed a large black Doberman Pincer to exit the door without a leash. As soon as the dog hit the porch, it saw me and immediately charged all the way to me on the sidewalk barking and snarling fiercely. I immediately placed my walking stick between the dog and my legs and began yelling for the man to call his dog back to the porch. Over the noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway and the fierce growling and barking of the dog, I could not be certain whether he called for the dog or not. He made no effort to come and get the dog and pull it back at all. The dog lunged towards me twice, and both times, I kept the dog away from me with my walking stick. The man had not left the porch at that time. Suddenly the dog tried to lunge under my stick to my right leg. At that time, I gave the dog a solid rap on the right side of the snout, which sent it reeling and yelping, and it finally retreated away from me. At the time the man, a young male of about 30, about 5\"10\" 220 lbs stocky broad build short cropped hair with thin goatee and mustache, came charging off the porch after me. I raised my walking stick port arms with both hands and yelled for him to back off, which he did not do. He grabbed my walking stick with both hands and tried to jerk it away, but I refused to surrender it holding on with all my might. Several more times, he tried to twist it away or jerk it away . I told him several times to back off and let go of my stick. His words were, \"Let go of your stick!? I ought to kick you ass!!\" among other curses and threats. He then proceeded to drive me backwards from the sidewalk across the lawn into the center of the street, continually trying to wrench my stick from my hands. At this point, I was hanging on for fear if he got it away, he would strike me with it. I again told him to back off and let go of my stick. I am 59 in June and have numerous health problems for heart trouble and back surgery to recent shoulder and stomach surgery, so about the best I could do was stay solid on that stick and hope he wouldn't start trying to kick me. He neither stuck nor kicked me at any time. Oh yeh - it's been a fun day - ahey Wandering and Wondering",

I was walking north west past the above identified Duplex and Apartment. I was squarely in the middle of the sidewalk, just passing the south apartment when a young man opened the door and allowed a large black Doberman Pincer to exit the door without a leash. As soon as the dog hit the porch, it saw me and immediately charged all the way to me on the sidewalk barking and snarling fiercely. I immediately placed my walking stick between the dog and my legs and began yelling for the man to call his dog back to the porch. Over the noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway and the fierce growling and barking of the dog, I could not be certain whether he called for the dog or not. He made no effort to come and get the dog and pull it back at all. The dog lunged towards me twice, and both times, I kept the dog away from me with my walking stick. The man had not left the porch at that time. Suddenly the dog tried to lunge under my stick to my right leg. At that time, I gave the dog a solid rap on the right side of the snout, which sent it reeling and yelping, and it finally retreated away from me. At the time the man, a young male of about 30, about 5\"10\" 220 lbs stocky broad build short cropped hair with thin goatee and mustache, came charging off the porch after me. I raised my walking stick port arms with both hands and yelled for him to back off, which he did not do. He grabbed my walking stick with both hands and tried to jerk it away, but I refused to surrender it holding on with all my might. Several more times, he tried to twist it away or jerk it away . I told him several times to back off and let go of my stick. His words were, \"Let go of your stick!? I ought to kick you ass!!\" among other curses and threats. He then proceeded to drive me backwards from the sidewalk across the lawn into the center of the street, continually trying to wrench my stick from my hands. At this point, I was hanging on for fear if he got it away, he would strike me with it. I again told him to back off and let go of my stick. I am 59 in June and have numerous health problems for heart trouble and back surgery to recent shoulder and stomach surgery, so about the best I could do was stay solid on that stick and hope he wouldn't start trying to kick me. He neither stuck nor kicked me at any time. Oh yeh - it's been a fun day - ahey Day-um! Hope that punk and his dog got hauled off. I thought you always packed heat? A .45 is a GREAT equalizer....",

I was walking north west past the above identified Duplex and Apartment. I was squarely in the middle of the sidewalk, just passing the south apartment when a young man opened the door and allowed a large black Doberman Pincer to exit the door without a leash. As soon as the dog hit the porch, it saw me and immediately charged all the way to me on the sidewalk barking and snarling fiercely. I immediately placed my walking stick between the dog and my legs and began yelling for the man to call his dog back to the porch. Over the noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway and the fierce growling and barking of the dog, I could not be certain whether he called for the dog or not. He made no effort to come and get the dog and pull it back at all. The dog lunged towards me twice, and both times, I kept the dog away from me with my walking stick. The man had not left the porch at that time. Suddenly the dog tried to lunge under my stick to my right leg. At that time, I gave the dog a solid rap on the right side of the snout, which sent it reeling and yelping, and it finally retreated away from me. At the time the man, a young male of about 30, about 5\"10\" 220 lbs stocky broad build short cropped hair with thin goatee and mustache, came charging off the porch after me. I raised my walking stick port arms with both hands and yelled for him to back off, which he did not do. He grabbed my walking stick with both hands and tried to jerk it away, but I refused to surrender it holding on with all my might. Several more times, he tried to twist it away or jerk it away . I told him several times to back off and let go of my stick. His words were, \"Let go of your stick!? I ought to kick you ass!!\" among other curses and threats. He then proceeded to drive me backwards from the sidewalk across the lawn into the center of the street, continually trying to wrench my stick from my hands. At this point, I was hanging on for fear if he got it away, he would strike me with it. I again told him to back off and let go of my stick. I am 59 in June and have numerous health problems for heart trouble and back surgery to recent shoulder and stomach surgery, so about the best I could do was stay solid on that stick and hope he wouldn't start trying to kick me. He neither stuck nor kicked me at any time. Oh yeh - it's been a fun day - ahey Day-um! Hope that punk and his dog got hauled off. I thought you always packed heat? A .45 is a GREAT equalizer....",

He neither stuck nor kicked me at any time. Oh yeh - it's been a fun day - ahey Dammit man! I thought I was having a bad day! I hope you go back and wear his azz out with that walking stick! I don't suppose the cops arrested him, did they?",
