How can we allow these entrenched, overpaid and compensated, special-interest puppet, self-serving basturds continue to stick it to us like this. Nearly every week I send off an email to my DC critters expressing this very sentement, to which their zombies return a \"thanks for contacting\" so-and-so. I'm certain a cadre of interns does all that while the demi-gods snicker over caviar and wine. For the total compensation package they get, I'd think/hope they'd at least read proposed legislation before putting ink to it...a $trillion later, no such luck. One observation re: the OP - theoretically congress does not have more power than the presidency. We're supposed to have 3 equally powerful branches: Admin Executive (damnit), Judicial, congress and Legislature- balance of power and all that. But, agreed, El Presidente is supposed to only be able to request/suggest bills, then twist congressional arms till some lakey does his bidding. This message has been edited.

The powers-that-be con everyone into believing all the power lies with El Presidente. Well, it doesn't my friends. The Congress has more power than the executive branch and . . . THE CONGRESS HAS AUTHORIZED EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING The President has no Constitutional authority to do most of the things they claim they can do. They can only ask the Congress to do what they want. The Congress could have stopped everything that's happening; the wars, the Wall Street takeover, the TRILLION DOLLAR defense budget they just passed. Our so-called representatives have sold us out so many times it makes my head spin and what do we all do? We not only let them keep their jobs, but you watch, they will most likely give themselves a raise, like they always do, for the fine job of screwing us they've done over the last two years. The way we hold our representatives accountable is to let them keep their $174,000 a year jobs so they can stick it to us for another two years! In case you're wondering, that's $14,500 a month, which includes another $4,700.00 raise they just gave themselves. *http://www.kickthemallout.com/index.php?msg=48*",
