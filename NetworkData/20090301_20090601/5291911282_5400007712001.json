The one I got looked like it was on 6th grade level math and basic logic. Turns out, it was harder than the test itself. I'll be brutally honost, if you maintained a C average or better, and can recognize patterns, you should have no problems at all with the ASVAB. Also, when I finished my training, I went and did a week of RAP duty(Recruiter Assistance Program), and at the recruiting station we had a practice ASVAB on the computer, and we had every potential recruit take it. All but one of some 50 potential recruits did better on the actual test than the practice test. \"http://www.testprepreview.com/asvab_practice.htm\" has a number of \"self assessments\" that covers everything you can imagine, and it looks to be pretty comprehensive, so you may want to give it a try. Also the military.com test is a very good representation of the real thing, I highly recommend it. {edit} I see I type too slowly... \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake.
