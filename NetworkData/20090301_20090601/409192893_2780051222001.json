Let me ask you this: Is ratting someone out worth that 30 year career going down the tubes? I suspect many of your coworkers are veterans - and we don't like rats. Why should it matter if the rat in this case is a veteran or not? Should a veteran 'rat' be allowed to disrespect fellow veterans by not giving service to which they're sworn? It is an honor and a privilege to serve our fellow veterans and it disrespects them when we fail to do so. Veterans are sometimes not awarded what they're entitled to simply because a few VA employees fail to give due diligence.
