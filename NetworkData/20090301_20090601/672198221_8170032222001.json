Won't be long before all the great people of that Era will be gone - - My Clergyman went with us on a Scouting Excursion years ago, and it was while sitting around the campfire, talking to us boys, he revealed that he had been a ball turret gunner in a B-17 shot down over Dresden during the firestorm raid. The local people wanted to pitchfork him when they found him injured on the ground, but the soldiers actually saved his life. He said he wasn't treated too badly while in one of the prison camps, and that the activities inside were much as depicted in the movie \"Great Escape\", but that he didn't feel a great urge to get out, because of the way the soldiers had saved him -- Anyway, the whole experience made him decide to be more religious and kind towards everyone... Of course, after hearing all that, he went way up on all our charts as being a very cool person, as was our Scout Master, who had fought under PAtton all through Africa, Sicily, and Italy... Both are long since dead - - Wandering and Wondering",
