Agreed with your premise up to a point but Bush is far from the culprit that got us on the road to subprime and free wheeling stocks and hedge funds. The simplicity of attacking one division of government or one person over this scheme of layered fraud started before Bush or Enron, Fannie, Freddie or the 110th Congress. The more you read the history the more abusive the money changers are. Legislation in the 1990's and signed into law produced the lack of regulation. No finger pointing, just a complaint that no one is looking out for our interest, the little guy. SEC is a government agency, cannot make law, only Congress. I'm afraid to say deregulated standards place in effect in 1930's were overshadowed, allowed the Fannie, Freddie and Enron's to run wild . The control of money is held by the greedy. Not even controlled by our government. In fact it's not In God We Trust, or silver certificates of the United States, It's comparibly few money institutions outside the government that actually feed on our interest and supply our monetary system. Research the Constitution on who shall provide legal tender Section 8 and then enter the world of the Federal Reserve.",
