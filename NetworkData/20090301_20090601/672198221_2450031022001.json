PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) targeted Africa's most stricken countries. PEPFAR was launched by President Bush in 2003. Experts from the Stanford University, lead by Eran Bendavid, state in a report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine that the program reduced AIDS deaths by approximately 10.5% per year in the most stricken African countries. They added that PEPFAR did not prevent new infections or reduce overall prevalence of AIDS. PEPFAR focused mainly on treating people who have AIDS, and to a lesser extent on prevention programs, including sexual abstinence. It was the largest single American foreign aid program ever...\" The article mentions the \"ABC approach\". What is that? Abstain, Be faithful, Condomize. According to the international AIDS charity AVERT: \"PEPFAR follows an ABC strategy through \"population-specific interventions\" that emphasise: * A bstinence for youth, including the delay of sexual debut and abstinence until marriage * B eing tested for HIV and being faithful in marriage and monogamous relationships * C orrect and consistent use of condoms for those who practice high-risk behaviours. Those who practice high-risk behaviours include \"prostitutes, sexually active discordant couples [in which one partner is known to have HIV], substance abusers, and others\". The PEPFAR definition does not include the promotion of condoms to young people in general.1 However, PEPFAR does say that its funds may be used to support programmes that deliver age-appropriate \"ABC information\" for young people, provided they are informed about failure rates of condoms, and provided the programmes do not appear to present abstinence and condom use as equally viable, alternative choices.\" \"http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm\" ...what Medicare bill did President Bush veto, and Congress overrode?",
