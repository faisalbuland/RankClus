Wed Apr 8, 6:23 pm ET DENVER \u2013 One Colorado woman's love for tofu has been judged X-rated by state officials. Kelly Coffman-Lee wanted to tell the world about her fondness for bean curd by picking certain letters for her SUV's license plate. Her suggestion for the plate: \"ILVTOFU.\" But the Division of Motor Vehicles blocked her plan because they thought the combination of letters could be interpreted as profane. Says Department of Revenue spokesman Mark Couch: \"We don't allow 'FU' because some people could read that as street language for sex.\" Officials meet periodically to ensure state plates stay free of letters that abbreviate gang slang, drug terms or obscene phrases. The 38-year-old Coffman-Lee says tofu is a staple of her family's diet because they are vegan and that the DMV misinterpreted her message. \"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090408/ap_on_fe_st/odd_tofu_snafu\"",
