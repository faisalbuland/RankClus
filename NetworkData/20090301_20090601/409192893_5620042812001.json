The reason 10tenths is being \"classified\" is so they can start their labeling campaign so anyone even thinking of becoming an informed independent thinker, will be quickly labeled and tagged. As long as everyone is focused on the self-induced economic ploy \u2013 the socialists can slip whatever necessary legislation they need under the radar \u2013 and NOBODY is even watching\u2026 How is it possible for congress to sign the LARGEST freaking SPENDING in our nation\u2019s history and NOT EVEN READ it? The despicable hypocrisy of this congress is pathetically obtuse \u2013 WE BETTER ALL START THINKING OF MILITIAS SOON \u2013 or it won\u2019t matter who runs for office because it will be no different than Chavez\u2026 Congress is trying to control \u2013 our money via Banking \u2013 our health via their gov regulated healthcare program \u2013 our jobs via forcing our jobs to be held captive under the socialist union agenda by their unconstitutional join or else legislation \u2013 our retirement and savings \u2013 our housing via the artificial bailout scenario which was uniquely created and craft by OUR CONGRESS \u2013 and they will control the votes via their special funding of the census boards\u2026 I guess the democrats have concluded that they will never remain in power unless they coerce \u2013 punish \u2013 starve \u2013 and extort the American people\u2026 but hey, maybe it\u2019s me\u2026 Unemployment is steadily moving up\u2026 it\u2019s ironic that we haven\u2019t even begun to feel the impact from all those socialist re-organization\u2026 but then \u2013 we all know it was Bush\u2019s fault\u2026 I agree though \u2013 Koresh was a waste of human flesh\u2026 Sadly, one bullet \u2013 one shot \u2013 one kill \u2013 would have been much easier and saved the lives of the others\u2026 heck for that matter they should put his butt in jail with the other crazy lunatic \u2013 captain Helter-Skelter - crispy brain Charlie Manson\u2026 putting them both in a 6 x 10 cell would have done them both some good because it be like looking in the mirror to both of the idiots. As for the gov \u2013 they are reaching way too far \u2013 way too fast \u2013 and WAY BEYOND their constitutional play-ground\u2026 It\u2019s time TERM LIMITS on all their butts \u2013 throw the bums out. Take their retirement & benefits \u2013 remove their housing allowance and require them ALL to punch a clock. The average congress-person works THREE DAYS per week and only 4-hrs each of those 3 useless days! The rest of the time they are at LOBBYIST Luncheons taking bribes to remain in office\u2026 I wonder if Jefferson spend it 90-thouand dollars of COLD CASH yet\u2026 sorry to ramble...",

Information was out there that he did this on a regular basis. There have been similar situations where the feds didn't go in like gangbusters & resolved a potentially deadly situation peacefully. What the hell was Janet \"I'll save the kids to death\" Reno trying to prove??? The stupidity of the actions of the feds, under Janet Reno, only served to kill a bunch of Branch Dividians & ATF agents.",

Absolutlelly not.",

Of course they deserved it, they were in this country legally, taking resources meant for 'undocumented immegrants'.",
