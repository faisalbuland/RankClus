I think she was \"myth\" october 1967!! Bruce, I'm afraid I can't give you a passing grade on your limerick. Here's how your score breaks down: Line 1: (Minus 5 points) You could have used someplace familiar, such as St. Paul, instead of someplace obscure. Line 2: (Minus 5 points) A good limerick should contain something shocking or attention grabbing in the first two lines. EXAMPLE: 1. There once was a man named Dave; 2. Who kept a wh0re in a cave; See? That makes you WANT to hear the rest. Yours is just weak. Sorry. Lines 3 & 4: Should rhyme. Minus 20 points. Line 5: (Minus 5 points) Doesn't really say anything, doesn't end in a pun or a surprise, just doesn't leave you with anything. And finally, Minus 25 points for failing the ultimate test of a limerick: can you tell it to a preacher without blushing? If the answer is yes, you don't have a true limerick. Your total score: 40 out of a possible 100. Minimum passing score: 70. Thanks for playing, and we have some lovely parting gifts backstage. Give him a big hand for playing, folks!
