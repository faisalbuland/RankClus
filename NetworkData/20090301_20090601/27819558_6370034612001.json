LOL, I understand your point. It does appear that LOGO has been favoring the *****s over the homo of late but I chalk that up to perhaps there is more film/stores available for the ladies. Nevertheless, it is great to have a venue where gay themed programming is available and not have to rely on the token gay in some of the network programs. The first gay character I recall (I am sure there were others) was on the infamous \u201cSoap\u201d sitcom of decades past. Then later there was Stephen on Dynasty and a sprinkling of others. When Will and Grace came along I believe that was the first gay themed show on a network and was groundbreaking and very successful. I recall a gay coffee shop in Houston had \u201cWill and Grace Night\u201d and the place was packed to watch on the big screen television. It became a Tuesday night social event. When LOGO first came out it was not an option here on COX Cable, so I called and told them I wanted it and sure enough it appeared in a week.
