I have never heard of this before and the list of WWII survivors is incredible. Doolittle Raiders, USMC Island Campaigners, USS Indianapolis survivor on and on. Band of Brother members as well. It says there will be a bunch of flight demos of some bombers and fighters. If you can afford it you can go on a flight. My boss says it is usually around 100.00 bones. I am getting pumped to just be able to see these men and take my 5 year old son.",
