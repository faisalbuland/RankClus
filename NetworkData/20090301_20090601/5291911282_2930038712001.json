In the remarks section it states \"transferred to TDRL\". Most of you know that TDRL stands for \"temporary disabled retired list\". My question is... \"Am I still ON the TDRL? Am I still on TDRL, with a stipulation that I am returning to active duty someday? Since I don't have a DD214 that is properly filled out, does that mean my discharge is not in effect? Will I have to get another outgoing physical and DD214\"? Any help on this is greatly appreciated.",
