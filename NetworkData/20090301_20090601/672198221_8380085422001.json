        "content": "quote: A New York City police officer who had just gotten off duty was fatally shot late Thursday night in East Harlem by a fellow officer who mistook him for an armed criminal, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said. The slain officer, Omar J. Edwards, 25, who was assigned to patrol housing projects and was wearing plain clothes, was shot in the arm and chest after a team of three other plainclothes officers in a car saw him chasing a man on East 125th Street between First and Second Avenues with his gun drawn, Mr. Kelly said. Sources identified the officer who fired the shot as Andrew Dunton, a four-year veteran of the force from Long Island. Officer Dunton and the two other officers assigned to the anticrime unit in the 25th Precinct got out of their vehicle and confronted Officer Edwards. The department on Friday was investigating whether the officers had identified themselves or demanded that Officer Edwards drop his weapon before Officer Dunton opened fire. Mr. Kelly said two of six bullets fired from the officer\u2019s 9-millimeter Glock struck Officer Edwards. Officer Edwards, a recently married father of two from Brooklyn, was taken to Harlem Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead at 11:21 p.m. No one else was injured. \"While we don\u2019t know all of the details of what happened tonight, this is a tragedy,\u201d Mayor Bloomberg said during an early morning news conference at the hospital. \u201cRest assured we will find out exactly what happened here and see what we can learn from it so it can never happen again.\u201d The shooting is likely to raise questions again about departmental procedures involving communications among plainclothes officers \u2014 particularly those in different units \u2014 as well as issues of race. Officer Edwards is black, and Officer Dunton is white. While a source in a position to know said that he had come across nothing so far that raised questions about the conduct of Officer Dunton or his fellow officers, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he was \u201cconcerned of a growing pattern of black officers being killed with the assumption that they are the criminals.\u201d \u201cThis calls for federal investigation and intervention to sort out the facts and bring about a just resolve,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cCan police investigate themselves fairly and impartially? It would seem very difficult at best and unlikely in fact.\u201d Mayor Bloomberg said on his radio show on Friday that investigators were reviewing security tapes of the shooting, which he maintained was not deliberate, and interviewing witnesses. Investigators were also questioning the man Officer Edwards had been chasing. \"The only thing that can come out of this is to improve procedures so perhaps it doesn\u2019t happen again,\" the mayor said. \"We all know policing is a dangerous job and accidents happen when people have guns in their hands, even legal guns in this case which they are authorized and trained to use.\" The department\u2019s policy manual \u2014 the Patrol Guide \u2014 is specific in putting the responsibility on the off-duty officer in such situations. In one section, titled \"confrontation situations,\" it says that if an off-duty officer is trying to make a arrest and is confronted by an on-duty officer, that the off-duty officer must abandon the arrest effort and comply with the on-duty officer\u2019s orders. \"In such encounters, the actions of the members in the first few seconds are of vital importance,\" the guide states. \"It must be absolutely clear in the minds of all members of the service that in any confrontation, the burden of proving identity rests on the confronted officer, whether on or off duty. The challenging officer, however, also has a responsibility to use sound tactics and judgment in approaching the situation.\" For member of the Police Department, the tragedy was compounded because Officer Edwards\u2019s father-in-law is also a police officer stationed in the 67th Precinct in Brooklyn, officials said. Officer Edwards, who joined the force in July 2007, was working as part of an Impact Response Team, a roving team of officers that supplement the department\u2019s prime crime-suppression program: Operation Impact. That program teams new officers with seasoned supervisors to flood areas where crime is surging. So in places where a city experiencing historic crime declines is still facing stubborn pockets of lawlessness, Officer Edwards was in the thick of that fight, officials said. +http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/nyregion/30cop.html?hp \"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\" -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
