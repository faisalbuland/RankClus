GOP, RNC to rebrand Democrats as 'Socialists' A member of the Republican National Committee told me Tuesday that when the RNC meets in an extraordinary special session next week, it will approve a resolution rebranding Democrats as the \u201cDemocrat Socialist Party.\u201d When I asked if such a resolution would force RNC Chairman Michael Steele to use that label when talking about Democrats in all his speeches and press releases, the RNC member replied: \u201cWho cares?\u201d Which pretty much sums up the attitude some members of the RNC have toward their chairman these days. Steele wrote a memo last month opposing the resolution. Steele said that while he believes Democrats \u201care indeed marching America toward European-style socialism,\u201d he also said in a (rare) flash of insight that officially referring to them as the Democrat Socialist Party \u201cwill accomplish little than to give the media and our opponents the opportunity to mischaracterize Republicans.\u201d Read more: \"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/22445.html#ixzz0FXLnp9QH&B\" Next they will be working on the \"Nanny, nanny boo-boo\" resolution...

Having watched the last tea party events on television, it was Fox news that gave them the most on air coverage.

What I'm trying to say, is that symbols have powerful meanings. And, I can't think of any symbol/s more overtly negative than the Hammer and Sickle, and the Swastika. Furthermore, I can't think of anything more offensive to the viewing American public, than those two particular symbols. Despite the large turn out at these events, it is the viewing public (whether on tv, newsprint or internet) that constitutes the larger majority.

Having watched the last tea party events on television, it was Fox news that gave them the most on air coverage. Plus, you had several GOP personalities speaking publicly at these events, in conjunction with Fox news. This gives the impression, that the RNC/GOP is orchestrating these events. You certainly don't see anyone from the Democratic party, in an alliance with the GOP publicly speaking at these events. So, whether or not the GOP is directly or indirectly involved in these events is irrelevant. What is relevent, are the speakers at these events, and their affiliation with the GOP. Those are the personalities the television/internet audience is viewing. And the viewing audience, won't forget who those people are.

[/QUOTE] That's fine. This organization may say they are bipartisan, and anyone with any political savvy would expect them to admit this. After all, they are trying to appeal to \"all the people.\" However, when you have signs displaying President Obama as Adolf Hitler, and other signs and flags which are reminiscent of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany at these events, the American audience is taking all of this in. What I'm trying to say, is that symbols have powerful meanings. And, I can't think of any symbol/s more overtly negative than the Hammer and Sickle, and the Swastika. Furthermore, I can't think of anything more offensive to the viewing American public, than those two particular symbols. Despite the large turn out at these events, it is the viewing public (whether on tv, newsprint or internet) that constitutes the larger majority. And, we have a saying in this country; \"majority rules.\" No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

I am fully aware that many who are GOP, or Right Wing, listen to Fox news, and Fox only. Those who are Moderate to Liberal, lean more towards CNN, MSNBC, etc. This is just my opinion nothing more, but I personally enjoy watching CNN over all the rest. I believe they represent the news in the most factually \"moderate\" sense of reporting the news. Yes, I'm fully aware that CNN has been dubbed by the cons as the Commie News Network. But I disagree with that assessment.
