If an ape made such a decision, we'd probably say that it has half a brain, but apparently politicians are regarded as better for doing the same thing. So how do you get Jobs? Military Jobs come from Republicans mostly (except for Jobs that send you away to Nonstrategic locations where you'll be out of Democrats' hair). Civilian Jobs don't come from either Republicans or Democrats., both of whom give them away to other nations, illegal immigrants, etc. Both parties seem to also manipulate Economic figures before Elections so that when the richest get more money, this is interpreted as \"Economic Health\" regardless of what everybody else in getting. The Democrats overall ruin the Non-Job-Economy more than the Republicans, though, by Spend-Spend-Spend for Nonstrategic reasons (those who don't want to work, Criminals, abortion, foreign giveaways, plain old Crooks in their pet districts, etc., favorite Ethnic Groups in their pet districts, etc.). Seniors (I'm 70) get shafted by both parties, although older Presidents probably have a little more sympathy for them than younger ones (the 3 youngest Presidents since Teddy Roosevelt were - guess who - Obama, Clinton, and Kennedy). Seniors who believe in Self-Defense probably will get more heart attacks and strokes from Obama, while their Jobs won't improve. They're more or less officially dead insofar as hiring unless by some miracle they've managed to get and stay in some tenured position. Osher Doctorow",

I'm against the Stimulus. It isn't just that Clinton and Obama aren't \"real\" liberals, but that they're not really for Jobs, and they're definitely not for BOTH Jobs and Self-Defense. I remind Readers that Bush won in 2000 and 2004 on Self-Defense but not Jobs, while the Dumbocrats and then Obama won in 2006 and 2008 on Jobs but not Self-Defense. That is really Dumb! If an ape made such a decision, we'd probably say that it has half a brain, but apparently politicians are regarded as better for doing the same thing. So how do you get Jobs? Military Jobs come from Republicans mostly (except for Jobs that send you away to Nonstrategic locations where you'll be out of Democrats' hair). Civilian Jobs don't come from either Republicans or Democrats., both of whom give them away to other nations, illegal immigrants, etc. Both parties seem to also manipulate Economic figures before Elections so that when the richest get more money, this is interpreted as \"Economic Health\" regardless of what everybody else in getting. The Democrats overall ruin the Non-Job-Economy more than the Republicans, though, by Spend-Spend-Spend for Nonstrategic reasons (those who don't want to work, Criminals, abortion, foreign giveaways, plain old Crooks in their pet districts, etc., favorite Ethnic Groups in their pet districts, etc.). Seniors (I'm 70) get shafted by both parties, although older Presidents probably have a little more sympathy for them than younger ones (the 3 youngest Presidents since Teddy Roosevelt were - guess who - Obama, Clinton, and Kennedy). Seniors who believe in Self-Defense probably will get more heart attacks and strokes from Obama, while their Jobs won't improve. They're more or less officially dead insofar as hiring unless by some miracle they've managed to get and stay in some tenured position. Osher Doctorow",
