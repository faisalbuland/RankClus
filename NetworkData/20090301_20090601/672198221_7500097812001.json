I have never had any law enforcement officer mistreat me in any way what so ever!... The rule of thumb is, treat an officer of the law with the same respect as you would have him/her treat you... Now, as to what I said earlier, anyone who will go out and take a bullet for another person and that persons family and never even have met them, is pretty d@mned fine in my book!...

Not only my juror had a predisposition favorable to law enforcement, but there's some cop out there who treated the citizen right during the first DWI arrest. The motorist wasn't embarrassed, ridiculed, or mistreated. He also took the hit like a man. The defendant was convicted upon trial and served 4 years for the death. The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeals. Since then our State Legislature has strengthened DWI laws making these deaths more serious.
