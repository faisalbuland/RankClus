And God help us, the enemy is far more honest than our leaders. Let's give credit where credit is due: George W. Bush reacted correctly to the 9/11 attack by taking out the Taliban in Afghanistan. And he acted correctly by deposing Saddam Hussein and turning Iraq into a nascent democracy. He did not finish the job, but considering that he had only 8 years and strong political opposition that's no surprise. But Bush made some serious mistakes, and those mistakes continue to hamper and hurt us. IMO, his most serious mistake, in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack, was his failure to adequately name the enemy who murdered 3,000 Americans in a single morning. Those people were murdered by Islamic terrorists. The terrorists who murdered them made their demands perfectly clear; they were the demands Mohammed made in the 700s. Submit to us or die. For whatever reason Bush labeled Islam a \"religion of peace\" and thus dodged a critical concept of the 21st Century. As much as I hate to say it, Osama bin Laden got what Bush fudged. Bin Laden saw a conflict between civilizations--Islamic against Western. Up to a point he was correct, but he missed the essential dividing point in the real struggle. This is a necessay fight to the death, but it is not necessarily limited to a contest between Islam and the West. This is a fight not only for the survival but for the soul of humanity. We cannot afford to lose this fight and must win it at all costs, but at the same time we must consider those costs. Our enemies are Islam and the secular notion of collectivism. We will not defeat those enemies at a debate table, and right now we can't even defeat them on a battlefield. Why? Because we refuse to really do what is necessary to win the fight. What do we need to do? We need to swallow hard and realize that certain enemies need to be destroyed. There is no room for equivocation. This war will kill some of our best people. That is unavoidable. But make their lost lives count--decimate the enemy to the point that all he can do is cry for mercy. Then silence that cry by finishing him off. We're not ready to do that just yet. A few more thousands of Americans will need to die before we're ready. God help us....",

Bush, but never defeated) think that they are now winning and al Qaeda has safe haven in Packistan. President Obama seems to have a better grasp on the situation. \"David Kilcullen, a counterinsurgency expert who has advised Petraeus, says, \"I've had tribal leaders and Afghan government officials at the province and district level tell me that 90 percent of the people we call the Taliban are actually tribal fighters or Pashtun nationalists or people pursuing their own agendas. Less than 10 percent are ideologically aligned with the Quetta Shura [Mullah Omar's leadership group] or Al Qaeda.\" These people are, in his view, \"almost certainly reconcilable under some circumstances.\" Beyond Afghanistan, too, it is crucial that we adopt a more sophisticated strategy toward radical Islam. This should come naturally to President Obama, who spoke often on the campaign trail of the need for just such a differentiated approach toward Muslim countries. Even the Washington Institute, a think tank often associated with conservatives, appears onboard. It is issuing a report this week that recommends, among other points, that the United States use more \"nuanced, noncombative rhetoric\" that avoids sweeping declarations like \"war on terror,\" \"global insurgency,\" even \"the Muslim world.\" Anything that emphasizes the variety of groups, movements and motives within that world strengthens the case that this is not a battle between Islam and the West. Bin Laden constantly argues that all these different groups are part of the same global movement. We should not play into his hands, and emphasize instead that many of these forces are local, have specific grievances and don't have much in common. The veil is not the same as the suicide belt. We can better pursue our values if we recognize the local and cultural context, and appreciate that people want to find their own balance between freedom and order, liberty and license.

We are at war with people who quite openly state that they are at war with us. And God help us, the enemy is far more honest than our leaders. Let's give credit where credit is due: George W. Bush reacted correctly to the 9/11 attack by taking out the Taliban in Afghanistan. And he acted correctly by deposing Saddam Hussein and turning Iraq into a nascent democracy. He did not finish the job, but considering that he had only 8 years and strong political opposition that's no surprise. But Bush made some serious mistakes, and those mistakes continue to hamper and hurt us. IMO, his most serious mistake, in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack, was his failure to adequately name the enemy who murdered 3,000 Americans in a single morning. Those people were murdered by Islamic terrorists. The terrorists who murdered them made their demands perfectly clear; they were the demands Mohammed made in the 700s. Submit to us or die. For whatever reason Bush labeled Islam a \"religion of peace\" and thus dodged a critical concept of the 21st Century. As much as I hate to say it, Osama bin Laden got what Bush fudged. Bin Laden saw a conflict between civilizations--Islamic against Western. Up to a point he was correct, but he missed the essential dividing point in the real struggle. This is a necessay fight to the death, but it is not necessarily limited to a contest between Islam and the West. This is a fight not only for the survival but for the soul of humanity. We cannot afford to lose this fight and must win it at all costs, but at the same time we must consider those costs. Our enemies are Islam and the secular notion of collectivism. We will not defeat those enemies at a debate table, and right now we can't even defeat them on a battlefield. Why? Because we refuse to really do what is necessary to win the fight. What do we need to do? We need to swallow hard and realize that certain enemies need to be destroyed. There is no room for equivocation. This war will kill some of our best people. That is unavoidable. But make their lost lives count--decimate the enemy to the point that all he can do is cry for mercy. Then silence that cry by finishing him off. We're not ready to do that just yet. A few more thousands of Americans will need to die before we're ready. God help us.... Our enemy are the terrorists who have thrown down the gauntlet. We deal with them accordingly. There's no need to victimize a billion people over the actions of a few extremists. We should have hit bin Laden, his cronies, and whoever else got in the way - then left Afghanistan. What was the point in staying there? Whom did that serve? What was this business about trying to democratize a people who, because of their spiritual beliefs and tribal customs, can't even comprehend the concept? And I'm not getting your tack on \"collectivism\" being hostile to our existence. We can't be a nation without some sense of collectivism. If we don't see ourselves as a people with things in common, how will the United States survive? Are you confusing the term with some notion of Marxism? I know that seems to be popular among a lot of people these days. If we have enemies who are actively working to disrupt or destroy our way of life, they must be dealt with accordingly. But I don't see a need to commit genocide. The threat of terrorism isn't existential. They may think themselves \"holy warriors\", but we don't need to honor that delusion. We get those little ****ants, strike them down forcefully and unceremoniously, and move on. I have no respect for their abilities and think they hold no real power outside of that which was given them by a bunch of ignorant ideologues who either overinflated the threat to cover up their own incompetence or used it as a pretext to further a political agenda.
