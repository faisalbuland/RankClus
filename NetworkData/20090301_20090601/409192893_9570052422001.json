The report, which the Obama administration may soon declassify, was completed in May 2004 and implicated CIA interrogators in at least three detainee deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq and referred eight criminal cases of alleged homicide, abuse and misconduct to the Justice Department for further investigation, reporter Jane Mayer wrote in her book, \"The Dark Side,\" and in an investigative report published in The New Yorker in November 2005. \"In \"The Dark Side,\" Mayer described the report as being \"as thick as two Manhattan phone books\" and contained information, according to an unnamed source, \"that was simply sickening\".\" \" Mayer added that Cheney routinely \"summoned\" Inspector General Helgerson to meet with him privately about his investigation, launched in 2003, and soon thereafter the probe \"was stopped in its tracks.\" Mayer characterized Cheney's interaction with Helgerson as highly unusual. Cheney's \"reaction to this first, carefully documented in-house study concluding that the CIA's secret program was most likely criminal was to summon the Inspector General to his office for a private chat,\" Mayer wrote. \"The Inspector General is supposed to function as an independent overseer, free from political pressure, but Cheney summoned the CIA Inspector General more than once to his office.\" \"Cheney loomed over everything,\" the former CIA officer told Mayer. \"The whole IG's office was completely politicized. They were working hand in glove with the White House.\" \" News reports have suggested that when Helgerson's report is declassified it will seriously undercut claims made by Cheney in numerous interviews that the systematic torture of \"high-value\" detainees produced valuable intelligence, thwarted pending terrorist plots against the United States and saved \"hundreds of thousands of lives.\" In addition to showing the inconclusive nature of the value of intelligence gleaned through torture, the report will likely show that Helgerson warned top CIA officials that the interrogation techniques administered to detainees \"might violate some provisions of the International Convention Against Torture.\" I don't think Bush is an evil man. I don't think he was strong enough to stop Cheney, which casts speculation on who was the real power behind the throne. There's a lot more here: >http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0905/S00243.htm",

Here are some quotes from Democrats reagarding Saddam, the pizz-ant dictator, and WMDs: \"We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.\" -- From a letter signed by Joe Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara A. Milulski, Tom Daschle, & John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998 \"This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer- range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.\" -- From a December 6, 2001 letter signed by Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Harold Ford, & Tom Lantos among others \"Whereas Iraq has consistently breached its cease-fire agreement between Iraq and the United States, entered into on March 3, 1991, by failing to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction program, and refusing to permit monitoring and verification by United Nations inspections; Whereas Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological capabilities, and has made positive progress toward developing nuclear weapons capabilities\" -- From a joint resolution submitted by Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter(since he's a Democrat now) on July 18, 2002 \"Saddam's goal ... is to achieve the lifting of U.N. sanctions while retaining and enhancing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs.

We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability.

If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow.\" -- Bill Clinton in 1998 \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\" -- Hillary Clinton, October 10, 2002 \"I am absolutely convinced that there are weapons...I saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out.\" -- Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April of 2003 \"Iraq is not the only nation in the world to possess weapons of mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader who has used them against his own people.\" -- Tom Daschle in 1998 \"Saddam Hussein's regime represents a grave threat to America and our allies, including our vital ally, Israel. For more than two decades, Saddam Hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every available means. We know that he has chemical and biological weapons. He has already used them against his neighbors and his own people, and is trying to build more. We know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons, and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \"The debate over Iraq is not about politics. It is about national security. It should be clear that our national security requires Congress to send a clear message to Iraq and the world: America is united in its determination to eliminate forever the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \"I share the administration's goals in dealing with Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Dick Gephardt in September of 2002 \"Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction.

Kerry, Oct 2002 \"The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation.\" -- John Kerry, October 9, 2002 \"(W)e need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime. We all know the litany of his offenses. He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. ...And now he is miscalculating America\u2019s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. That is why the world, through the United Nations Security Council, has spoken with one voice, demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but it is not new. It has been with us since the end of the Persian Gulf War.\" -- John Kerry, Jan 23, 2003 \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region.

During 1991 - 1994, despite Iraq's denials, U.N. inspectors discovered and dismantled a large network of nuclear facilities that Iraq was using to develop nuclear weapons. Various reports indicate that Iraq is still actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability. There is no reason to think otherwise. Beyond nuclear weapons, Iraq has actively pursued biological and chemical weapons.U.N. inspectors have said that Iraq's claims about biological weapons is neither credible nor verifiable. In 1986, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran, and later, against its own Kurdish population. While weapons inspections have been successful in the past, there have been no inspections since the end of 1998. There can be no doubt that Iraq has continued to pursue its goal of obtaining weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Patty Murray, October 9, 2002 \"As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\" -- Nancy Pelosi, December 16, 1998 \"Even today, Iraq is not nearly disarmed. Based on highly credible intelligence, UNSCOM [the U.N. weapons inspectors] suspects that Iraq still has biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic missile warheads, as well as the means to continue manufacturing these deadly agents. Iraq probably retains several tons of the highly toxic VX substance, as well as sarin nerve gas and mustard gas. This agent is stored in artillery shells, bombs, and ballistic missile warheads. And Iraq retains significant dual-use industrial infrastructure that can be used to rapidly reconstitute large-scale chemical weapons production.\" -- Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter in 1998 (Just an extra) \"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years. And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources -- something that is not that difficult in the current world. We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002 \"Saddam\u2019s existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America, now. Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq\u2019s enemies and against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002 \"Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Administration\u2019s policy towards Iraq, I don\u2019t think there can be any question about Saddam\u2019s conduct. He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do. He lies and cheats; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the United Nations, the Security Council, the United States and our allies. Those are simply the facts.\" -- Henry Waxman, Oct 10, 2002 The idea that Saddam was producing WMDs preceeds the Bush administration, and as it appears from these quotes, just about everyone was onboard.",

There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs.

At the end of the Bush/Cheney watch: Al Qaeda has safe havens in Pakistan from which they are planning and training for the next attack on America. Al Qaeda in Iraq can still kill Americans and dozens of Iraqis at a time, but President Bush signed an agreement to leave Iraq, even though America\u2019s number one enemy still operates there. Al Qaeda threatens Pakistan and Somalia, which was not the case before CinC Bush took over. America was not attacked since 9/11 \u2013 that was seven and a half years. President Clinton\u2019s record was just as good. The Twin Towers were attacked in February 1993, and not again until September 2001 - without torturing anyone. Clinton's record, let's be fair: 1993 New York City: bomb exploded in basement garage of World Trade Center, killing 6 and injuring at least 1,040 others. In 1995, militant Islamist Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 9 others were convicted of conspiracy charges, and in 1998, Ramzi Yousef, believed to have been the mastermind, was convicted of the bombing. Al-Qaeda involvement is suspected. 1995 April 19, Oklahoma City: car bomb exploded outside federal office building, collapsing wall and floors. 168 people were killed, including 19 children and 1 person who died in rescue effort. Over 220 buildings sustained damage. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols later convicted in the antigovernment plot to avenge the Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Tex., exactly 2 years earlier. Nov. 13, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: car bomb exploded at U.S. military headquarters, killing 5 U.S. military servicemen. 1996 June 25, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia: truck bomb exploded outside Khobar Towers military complex, killing 19 American servicemen and injuring hundreds of others. 13 Saudis and a Lebanese, all alleged members of Islamic militant group Hezbollah, were indicted on charges relating to the attack in June 2001. 1998 Aug. 7, Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: truck bombs exploded almost simultaneously near 2 U.S. embassies, killing 224 (213 in Kenya and 11 in Tanzania) and injuring about 4,500. 4 men connected with al-Qaeda 2 of whom had received training at al-Qaeda camps inside Afghanistan, were convicted of the killings in May 2001 and later sentenced to life in prison. A federal grand jury had indicted 22 men in connection with the attacks, including Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who remained at large. 2000 Oct. 12, Aden, Yemen: U.S. Navy destroyer USS Cole heavily damaged when a small boat loaded with explosives blew up alongside it. 17 sailors killed. Linked to Osama bin Laden, or members of al-Qaeda terrorist network. No one said that President Clinton was \u201ccommittment to destroy terrorists and their allies by any means necessary\u201d - which is why I made my comment. And what ever President Clinton did or did not do, does not excuse the FACT that President Bush invaded two countries, had American at war for more than seven years, but failed to defeat American\u2019s number one enemy \u2013 al Qaeda. It was foreign attacks on American soil I was referring to, but by all means, let\u2019s be fair - terrorists have been very busy on President Bush\u2019s watch, even if you do not count all the Americans they have killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. 2002 June 14, Karachi, Pakistan: bomb exploded outside American consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, killing 12. Linked to al-Qaeda. 2003 May 12, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: suicide bombers killed 34, including 8 Americans, at housing compounds for Westerners. Al-Qaeda suspected. 2004 May 29\u201331, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: terrorists attack the offices of a Saudi oil company in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, take foreign oil workers hostage in a nearby residential compound, leaving 22 people dead including one American. June 11\u201319, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: terrorists kidnap and execute Paul Johnson Jr., an American, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 other Americans and BBC cameraman killed by gun attacks. Dec. 6, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: terrorists storm the U.S. consulate, killing 5 consulate employees. 4 terrorists were killed by Saudi security. 2005 January 30, BAGHDAD, Iraq \u2014 U.S. forces on Saturday captured seven suspected insurgents believed to be behind an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that killed two Americans and wounded six.(Happened in the war zone...) Nov. 9, Amman, Jordan: Suicide bombers hit 3 American hotels, Radisson, Grand Hyatt, and Days Inn, in Amman, Jordan, killing 57. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility. 2006 Feb. 19, 2006 JAKARTA, Indonesia - Hundreds of Muslims protesting caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad stormed the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Sept. 13, Damascus, Syria: Four gunman attack the American embassy. 2007 Jan. 12, Athens, Greece: the U.S. embassy was fired on by an anti-tank missile causing damage but no injuries. February 17, A JAPANESE extreme left-wing group has claimed responsibility for a small explosion near a US army base outside Tokyo ahead of US Vice President Dick Cheney's visit to Japan. Jan. 12, Athens, Greece: the U.S. embassy is fired on by an anti-tank missile causing damage but no injuries. 2008 Sept. 16, Yemen: a car bomb and a rocket strike the U.S. embassy in Yemen as staff arrived to work, killing 16 people, including 4 civilians. As far as I remember, we were at war after 9/11...I expect attacks to increase once the enemy is actively engaged. These attacks may have happened even if we didn't engage in Iraq and just stuck with Afghanistan. This message has been edited. Last edited by: psychoABN, Mon 25 May 2009 08:52 PM",

        "content": "We can get into an endless cycle of who said what. In 1998 Albright said Hussein was a threat. In 2001 Colin Powell said he was not. However, people who are not experts on torture, such as Cheney, are telling us how effective it was while people who are experts, such as a head interrogator for Mossad, says it is not. We have people who have never been waterboarded swearing it is not torture, while those who have experienced it say it is. We had to go into Iraq because Hussein was such a terrible man, doing such terrible things to his people, while we turned a blind eye to what was going on in Darfur. And Hussein had been doing those terrible things to his people for a long time, even while he was our \"friend\" (research the timeline for Halabja). We were trying to work a pipeline deal with Afghanistan and the Taliban as late as July 2001, without regard to the way the citizens of that nation were being treated. So let's not pretend we really give a hoot about the civil rights of people in other nations. One thing we know about the people we are dealing with; they are incredibly patient. It was 10 years between the first WTC attack and the second, so I don't know that we want to relax yet. Muslims in the Philippines still swear they will kill Americans because Americans killed their grandparents. Is America safer? How can we say that? We went into Afghanistan supposedly to get OBL. We didn't get him. Before that front was really well under way, President Bush tried to prove his cajones were bigger than his Daddy's by going after Saddham Hussein, who in 8 years couldn't even shoot down one of our aircraft patroling right over his head. Yet we are to believe he was such a tremendous threat to the security of our country? When did the U.S. start quaking at the threat of a tinhat dictator? And while President Bush was getting off on being a \"war president\" and a \"decider\", industry in our own country was going right down the tubes. The big oil companies were racking up higher profits every quarter while Americans were trying to make ends meet and save their homes. Companies like Blackwater, KBR, and Haliburton were making money hand over fist, while our soldiers were getting electrocuted in showers KBR built and drinking water unfit for human consumption. Had we concentrated on Afghanistan, women there might have some rights. The Taliban might be a bunch of old men, reliving their glory days in a local coffee shop. And the Iraqui people, seeing what was possible, might have taken care of Saddham on their own. I will consider our misadventures in this part of the world a success when Americans can walk the streets of Kabul or Baghdad in civilian clothes after duty hours and enjoy the open markets as they do in Germany, S. Korea, Japan, and so many other places in the world where we are still stationed. As long as they have to be in full body armor everytime they step outside a compound, I don't consider the job done. I'll consider we've been successful when women in those countries can go to school, and not live in fear that some minor infraction would result in public caning or execution. And while our people are still dying in Iraq and Afghanistan, Cheney is wandering around making money with his public appearances, not having to answer for any of his actions; Bush is relaxing at home, recalling his glory days on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln; and Rumsfeld? He's keeping a low profile, lest he be called to task for his impact on the military and his dismal performance as SECDEF. When will we be safer? When Americans can once again travel anywhere in the world in relative safety. When our industry is once again robust and leading the world in innovation. When our citizens don't go into a panic everytime a plane flies low over NYC, or an envelope is dropped in a parking lot. When once again, American is looked upon as the leader in world economics and industry. It's going to take a lot of money and a lot of effort from all of us to regain our position.",
