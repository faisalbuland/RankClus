I've never spent any time in the sand but I live about 10 minutes away from Dearborn, Michigan which is the Muslim capitol of America, meaning more Muslims live here than any other place outside the ME. I've worked with some of these folks on various projects and actually call some of them friends. I've had discussions with people who are as American as you are and voted for Bush. I've talked to people who support Hamas and hate Israel. Some of them are very religious, some not so much. So I don't know any Muslims in Arabia but I do know some Arab Muslims. Just said that to show you how you tend to jump to unwarranted conclusions and operate on false projections that inevitably force you into irrelevant and wrong end results. You once again fall victim to you ideological filter which forces you to exonerate the right wing when they're guilty as sin and forces you to blame everything on the left - which may also be guilty as sin. In other words, you either tell deliberate lies to score propaganda points, or you really are incapable of fair and honest observations. Your above post is fairly coherent until this paragraph: In this regard the forces of our far left and even those of soem moderate lefts have helped them.

That's so full of conjecture, half truths and outright lies that I hardly know where to begin. Thousands of illegals in the country just to build a voting block for Democrats? Do you really believe that crap? Is it really true that the right wing has absolutely no hand in this and has nothing to gain like for instance cheap labor that will never ask for a raise or unionize? Can illegals vote here? No. Can they work and undercut American wages and deprive Americans of jobs? Certainly. Maybe you'd care to define that one culture that built this nation. I think it was many cultures that define American culture as a whole. Your whole take on returning Soldiers has been thoroughly discredited and deserves no further comment. Pelosi? Well, that still has to play out. I think if she and others were sworn to secrecy (if true) makes the rest of your argument invalid. How you can just ignore 8 years of incompetency by the red team and blame all our ills on the heretofore powerless left wing is amusing at best and troubling at worst. Maybe it's just an inability to admit that your guys have objectively screwed the proverbial pooch on multiple occasions with vigor and enthusiasm. You want to take the blowback from their multitude of mistakes and blame it on the guys who have to clean it up. That's just dishonest. If you want to debate then at least approach with a bit of integrity. Basing your argument on distortions and lies means you build your castle by the water on a base of sand.
