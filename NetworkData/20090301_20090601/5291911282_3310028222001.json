More like millions. but the signs are translated into every MAJOR language on earth. not just Spanish. I hope they are in Airports and Bus stations, train stations. But not everywhere and at goverment cost. Based on the Ethnic Breakdown of this Nation, Spanish would be the most mnumerous. so that is the Language you notice the most. That would be fine if it were just in San Diego, Los Angeles, Houston, San Antonio or Phoenix. But should multi-lingual signs be required for Maine or Vermont? Ever take a drive though little Vietnam? or your city's Version of Chinatown? korea town? Of course an ethnic neighborhood would have signs in their language. I see signs in all languages, for businesses that advertise for the ethnic customer or aficionado as long as they don't expect the government to foot the bill for signs in every language for every dumb little thing. that is right... the signs are in those languages. INCLUDING THE ROAD SIGNS. When the local authority is either awash in a kumbahya drunk or succumbs to the school of thought that caters to the lazy. fact is, if we spent half as much money we spend on signs, and put the rest in EDUCATION, the whole signg business would me moot. I could do that if the curriculum didn't cause our children to want to do stupid things. but we deny funding for teachers, fill school board's pockets., build more schools, and refuse to buy books. we take the failures on in the system, and put them in prisons until they die, and feel good about ourselves. I don't condone that kind of administration.",
