I'm in ROTC right now and getting ready to go to LDAC (Camp); I don't want to fall in the category that I should put QM as first choice because I have some experience in that field. I just want something that I will enjoy. My GPA, leadership performance, etc. have all been great. Just have to work more on my PT (currently at 274 points). I not a hardcore person, but I don't want to doubt my potential either. I am a bit nervous to add combat arms as first choice because I don't want to be a lousy Infantry Officer. If you've been an Infantry Officer, or other Branch, how was your experience? Were the NCOs harsh on you. What was good/bad, regrets? My brother is an 11B NCO but I prefer insight from Officers since it's a different world. Right now it's between Infantry, MI, and QM as # 1 choice. Any thoughts, suggestions, advice? Thanks",
