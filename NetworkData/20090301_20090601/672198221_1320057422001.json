(...) The comments may revive debate about the looming absence of the queen, who served in uniform during World War II, from the commemoration ceremonies, following last week reports of an Anglo-France rift over the ceremony. France said last week that Queen Elizabeth would be welcome to attend the event, featuring Obama, French President Nicholas Sarkozy, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. But the queen did not specifically receive an invitation from the French government, even though she was present for the 60th anniversary event in 2004, amid claims in the British press that she was annoyed at being excluded. Paris said an invitation had been extended to the British government and it was up to Prime Minister Gordon Brown to decide who would attend. \"The Queen of England, as British head of state, is naturally welcome,\" said French government spokesman Luc Chatel. (...) Earlier on Monday, Brown said he would be happy to arrange for the queen to attend the commemorations. (...) A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman however made it clear Monday that the queen would not be attending the events in France marking D-Day, and stressed she was not upset about the situation. (...) \"We would like to reiterate that we have never expressed any sense of anger or frustration at all, and are content with all the arrangements that are planned.\" (...)",

        "quote": "White House working on D-Day invite for Queen 33 minutes ago WASHINGTON (AFP) - The White House said Monday it was working with organizers of next weekend's D-Day 65th anniversary commemorations to secure an invitation for Queen Elizabeth II. (...) The comments may revive debate about the looming absence of the queen, who served in uniform during World War II, from the commemoration ceremonies, following last week reports of an Anglo-France rift over the ceremony. France said last week that Queen Elizabeth would be welcome to attend the event, featuring Obama, French President Nicholas Sarkozy, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. But the queen did not specifically receive an invitation from the French government, even though she was present for the 60th anniversary event in 2004, amid claims in the British press that she was annoyed at being excluded. Paris said an invitation had been extended to the British government and it was up to Prime Minister Gordon Brown to decide who would attend. \"The Queen of England, as British head of state, is naturally welcome,\" said French government spokesman Luc Chatel. (...) Earlier on Monday, Brown said he would be happy to arrange for the queen to attend the commemorations. (...) A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman however made it clear Monday that the queen would not be attending the events in France marking D-Day, and stressed she was not upset about the situation. (...) \"We would like to reiterate that we have never expressed any sense of anger or frustration at all, and are content with all the arrangements that are planned.\" (...)",

This is an internal British issue and to my mind the only way it can be solved satisfactorily is for Brown to apologise to HM profusely and allow her to take his place or for HM to ask someone else to form a government and dissolve Parliament (which needs doing anyway after the expenses scandals) in preparation for a general election.

If anyone needs a special separate invitation it's the Prime Minister, who is technically merely a flunky. wtf? I'm having difficulty simplifying the concept further. For the purposes of this sort of thing the Queen is the United Kingdom. An invitation to the UK to attend something is an invitation to the Queen (because the whole bloody country can't very well go can it?) if the French president had wanted the Prime Minister alone to go he'd have sent the invitation to \"Her Majesty's Government\". In terms of non-political international events it's kings, queens, emperors and presidents who have the same status as Heads of State. The confusion here arises, I think, because some presidents (notably the French and the American) are also Heads of Government a separate job done by prime ministers and chancellors and the like in many countries.",

They understand - as apparently our own Prime Minister does not - that that means the Sovereign as the personification of the State. If you invite Germany or Ireland or Italy Or India or Israel to something you're effectively inviting the (non executive) president as the personification of that country. They may choose to send (or by internal national protocol automatically deputise) someone else but it's the Head of State who is invited.

This is an internal British issue and to my mind the only way it can be solved satisfactorily is for Brown to apologise to HM profusely and allow her to take his place or for HM to ask someone else to form a government and dissolve Parliament (which needs doing anyway after the expenses scandals) in preparation for a general election. Prime ministers cannot be allowed to get away with what is close to lese majeste like this or one day we'll find we can't get shot of one of the buggers.",
