        "content": "Alfie Patten was believed to be Britain's youngest father after his 15-year-old girlfriend, Chantelle Steadman, gave birth to baby girl Maisie. But then many other boys claimed they also slept with the mother, who had previously said that Alfie was the only boy she had slept with. As a result, Alfie took a DNA test, which indicated that he's not the father. His mum Nicole, 43, added at the time: \"It had not even crossed Alfie's mind whether Chantelle had not been faithful to him. He's absolutely devastated that these lads say they slept with her.\" Rest here: \"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfmoms/detail?&entry_id=37526\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

The Mirror, the initial source for the SFGATE story in the lead post, has taken down their article and a search of their website finds no reference to the results of the DNA test. One wonders if they took it down due to legal issues ... or because they had bad information. The results of the DNA test were, by judicial decree, not supposed to be made public.",
