T The point is...once again....that your rights don't come from MEN or GOVERNMENTS!! If they did, the constitution wouldn't be worth a tinker's damn!! The words of the Declaration of independance and the Constitution, are what created the dream in men's minds that YOU are now living!! That is all it is people, a dream!! That's how truly fragile it really is!! It is a chimera, a wil-o-the wisp, A phantasm, sprung directly from the hearts of dreamers from over two centuries ago, that they formed into a living presence and a dream that millions have lived. And, they did so, without truly knowing what it was or how it was attained, but living it none the less. A chimera, that some few among us all, even today, are willing to give their lives for, even though they couldn't really explain it to you either!! From time out of mind, from even before the dawn of civilization, men and women have felt it, lived for it, trained their children to covet and treasure it, even though they couldn't explain it, or where it came from then, or where it comes from now. Some shouted it as they died, some whispered it as their lives fled from them in rivulets across the ground, of some far away battlefield, they couldn't even pronounce the name of properly. Some have pursued it through swamps real and imagined, across deserts that stretched beyond their endurance, just as the hunger for it outlived them. Some have provided it for us without knowing they did so, simply by being productive citizens and paying the taxes levied for the joint defense of us all. Some have preserved it, dying in prisons of the unjust and by being remembered for their courage and inspiring us to ever greater efforts toward it's preservation. Some have conveyed with a glance, all of it's meaning and some, with millions of words, have failed to convey even a glimmer of what it truly IS. It is a word, a thought, a deed, a hope, a wish, a memory for some, for others a future untold. But at the end of each day...still a dream, still a chimera, still a will-o-the wisp, unfathomable, unexplainable, unearned, loved and cherished, even to foolishness, but NEVER to be surrendered. NEVER to be given up and never, never to be thrown away! The name of the dream?? One word.....freedom. The place where it was truly given life in the minds and hearts of men? The United States of America. And for at least a while, as it is cast aside by the many for security in the foolish hope that a man can preserve it alone for us, with the hollow promises of a politician, the last best hope for the world, the same, The United States of America. The land of dreamers....may we be preserved as such....... This message has been edited. Last edited by: tawodi, Sat 02 May 2009 07:42 AM",

        "content": "Look, Jefferson used the words \"We believe that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. . .\" in a failed attempt to appeal to the religious feelings of the Parliament, mainly the House of Commons, of England. If you read the whole document, you'll see that it tries to play the House of Commons, which was thought still to have some hatred and distrust of monarchy and aristocracy, against King George by blaming him for everything! What most people don't know is that the Continental Congress had already sent a similar document, called the Olive Branch Petition, to the King, blaming Parliament for everything, like a bad child trying to play the parents against each other!! Neither the King nor Parliament was impressed by either document. That's why they sent 30,000 troops in several hundred ships to crush the writers!! The point is, Jefferson was playing word games, and his heart wasn't that far into it, or it would have had more stern language in it. Why didn't they get \"Give me Liberty or give me DEATH!\" Patrick Henry, with his revival tent style to write it. He would have said, \"God gave us these rights, and as a God fearing nation, and under His protection, we are ready to fight to the Death to be free of you!!\" But you see, Jefferson was a diplomatist, with lukewarm religious feelings, if any real ones at all. So he played the religious word game a little hoping to fine some sympathy and failed. Then he went off and hid on his plantation with his slave mistress and his blossoming, self-indulgent deism, to sit out the war, before shipping to France, where he could really fulfill his dreams during and after his wife lay dying, by chasing the wife of some French Officer - - Think not too heavily on the Declaration of Independence, because no one of the time did, including its author. It was only in later times, when Americans started groping for some sense of identity - about the time of the War of 1812, that someone dusted it off and started talking of it as being some kind of National Icon... And of course, because of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson's other foibles had been whited out - despite the fact that it was his blunders and coziness with deist, terror-ridden and Napoleonic France that set up the War of 1812 with England in the first place . . Most like, \"endowed by the Creator\" was almost a cringing joke in the back of Jefferson's mind, hoping to \"fool all those deluded superstitionists\" into agreeing with him - - Think nothing of the phrase, if you revere it for Jefferson's sake - - If you actually believe in a real God - well that's different all together - - Wandering and Wondering",
