WASHINGTON - As he enters his 100th day in office, President Barack Obama enjoys higher marks from the American public than his most recent predecessors did at similar points in their presidencies, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. More than six in 10 approve of Obama's job, nearly two-thirds view him favorably, and a majority believe he has gotten off to a solid start during his first three months on the job. Perhaps most significantly, Americans so far find him to be likeable. More than 80 percent in the poll say they personally like Obama, even if they don\u2019t agree with all of his policies. And respondents give him high scores on his personality, demeanor and leadership qualities. Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who conducted this survey with Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, says these numbers suggest \u201csomeone who is wearing well\u201d with the public at this stage of his presidency. McInturff, in fact, even compares Obama\u2019s early likeability to Ronald Reagan\u2019s in the 1980s. >http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/us_world/Poll__Obama_gets_high_early_marks.html",

WASHINGTON - As he enters his 100th day in office, President Barack Obama enjoys higher marks from the American public than his most recent predecessors did at similar points in their presidencies, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. More than six in 10 approve of Obama's job, nearly two-thirds view him favorably, and a majority believe he has gotten off to a solid start during his first three months on the job. Perhaps most significantly, Americans so far find him to be likeable. More than 80 percent in the poll say they personally like Obama, even if they don\u2019t agree with all of his policies. And respondents give him high scores on his personality, demeanor and leadership qualities. Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who conducted this survey with Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, says these numbers suggest \u201csomeone who is wearing well\u201d with the public at this stage of his presidency. McInturff, in fact, even compares Obama\u2019s early likeability to Ronald Reagan\u2019s in the 1980s. >http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/us_world/Poll__Obama_gets_high_early_marks.html",
