I know it is war, but what makes these servicemen such heros. I would never steal a combat veteran's thunder, Ialways make it clear I was a jet mechanic and give the combat guys their due. By the way, I wore my Vidtnam veteran hat to my new job a Kroger on Veteran's Day and low and behold I was fired for it. Not a veteran friendly employer. I helped stock a new store and one day after it opened I was let go. Can't quite figure out what happened so I guess it was the fact that I did on wear my Kroger hat. I have a Navy buddy that was spit on in the San Francisco airport. Too bad the media could not portray us in a better light. Heros? The KIA's are the heros, not every one that serves. BS!! WW II veterans were heros, not much mention of them anymore, but at least they did get parades. We ran the gauntlet like prisoners and tried to get back into the good old American mainstream. I am sick of hearing of all these heros. I am respectful of them but they are not all heros. How about a draft for some of these punks running the streets dealing drugs, shooting people, robbing old people, etc. This could go on forever.",
