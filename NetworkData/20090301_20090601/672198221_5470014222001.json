No one can excuse how business was done years ago but that does not mean it is that way today. Should they clean up their mess?

How much rain forest has been destroyed due to sprawl and trying to turn it into farmland and pasture for cattle? Oh I havn't. That's the first thing that came to mind whenever I see a rain forest. They are so gorgious. These people are sitting on a treasure worth allot more than oil. Oh, I agree very beautiful land. But, it isn't our land, it belongs to the people of South America. From reading the article, it seems it is a legal issue between Chevron/Texaco and petroecuador. If what we read is true, Chevron did some of the clean-up and now there is arguing between parties over who does the rest. However, the article seems to want to blame it all on Chevron/Texaco and seemingly so do the lawyers. I did not see where it is that cut and dry. The heading of this thread seems to indicate you side with the lawyers and it is all the fault of Chevron/Texaco.",
