The Soviet's demise was mainly due to our CIA support of the Tajiks and Mujihadeen with arms, hand held ground to air missiles, ammo, food, medical supplies, and money, all delivered through Pakistan with Pakistani cooperation. Further, U.S. Military occupation and intervention in Afghanistan, with large deployments of troops, will contribute to a weakening U.S. economy, lead to the diminishing of the U.S. as a world power, and ultimately increase the economic power of competitors and potential enemies. Let's not bankrupt ourselves in Afghanistan! Since World War II, we gave Stalin all of eastern Europe, we allowed Mao Tse Tung to take over China, we gave the Philipines away, we gave away the northern half of Korea, after Gen. MacArthur had secured it all the way to the Yalu River, we gave Fidel Castro Cuba, and we gave Ho Chi Minh Vietnam, after screwing around there for ten years. We gave the Panama Canal away. Now we've wasted seven years screwing around in Iraq, bilking U.S. Taxpayers, while accomplishing very little, other than some lucrative defense department contracts and oil contracts to favored corporations and individuals. And now as the Iraq fiasco winds down, we're actually stepping up our deployment, involvement, and intervention in Afghanistan. We would probably be better advised to focus on our own deteriorating domestic economy and forget about international warfare. This does not, in any way, preclude current efforts to bring Osama Ben Laden and his cohorts and conspirators to justice. The CIA did a wonderful job in Afghanistan in the past, and they could be very effective there right now.",
