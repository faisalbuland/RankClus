It's been in the plans for years through various secret societies [read: masons, area 51, men-in-black, and the 'grays'] intent on world peace through unprecedented domination of the non-tax-paying, lower working class general public, 'change' in the political processes, and mass innocculations of the world population with toxic biological 'immunizations' which cause one to become unintelligible, lazy, and willing to accept not only handouts from the governemnt, but allowing the government to do all of our thinking and decision-making... This is a MASSIVE conspiracy with previously unheard of consequences for all living creatures, great and small, and will exponentially affect generations to come. Course, this IS only one theory...
