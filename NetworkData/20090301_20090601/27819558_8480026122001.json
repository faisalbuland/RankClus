Everyone who has ever been in the military knows that gays and lesbians have fought in the trenches, just the same as anyone else. So I invite you to tell me a story- a story about being gay in the military, or serving with someone gay. I'm not looking for titillating sexual escapades, just something light hearted and fun. I'll start: When I was stationed in Pearl Harbor, I was on board a fast attack submarine that would come in and out constantly. In for 2 days, out for a week, in for 5 days, out for 3 weeks. After an especially long outing at sea, we pulled up to our berth one morning and caught sight of a welcoming party laid out along the pier. It was the usual gang of wives and girlfriends but this time I was surprised to see my very own boyfriend standing there, too! He was accompanied by a female friend of ours, who served as our \"beard\" on these occasions, but all in all it was one of the nicest home port returns I was privileged enough to get. I ALMOST felt bad that I had volunteered for duty that day (I had wanted to give the other guys in my division who did have wives and GFs a chance to be welcomed home properly). My BF and our mutual girlfriend did stay around after the welcoming party and keep me a little bit of company on a lonesome duty afternoon. We had dinner down on the mess decks like regular folks and made a great afternoon of it, all in all. Does anybody else have any great stories to share? If you're active duty then please exercise discretion and restrict yourself to non-specific details. If you're a veteran, then, hell- spill the beans. Being out is one of our privileges as civilians and our best argument against those who say gays have no place in the military. And remember to respect your brothers and sisters in arms! Don't compromise the career of anyone else who still might be active. We look out for each other! This message has been edited. Last edited by: Frank_A_Valdez, Fri 24 April 2009 12:09 PM",

Returning from deployment is always a little weird, because it's hard to know just how far we can go with each other. My partner and I are both in the Navy, though he is a skimmer. It's beyond disappointing to have to stick to a handshake \"just to be safe\" when everyone around is ecstatic.",

When I was stationed in Hawaii I ran into this guy at a bar who happened to be with the Air Force. His name was K-- We get to talking and he says, \"Hey, I want you to meet my wife !!\" So he calls this pretty young lady over and we all get to laughing and joking. Her name was N-- and it turns out she was in the military, too, (Army I think). They had gotten married to each other so they could get permission to move off base (they were both pretty junior at the time and it would've been impossible otherwise). Basically, it spared them the worst of the ****phobic nuisances and they got to live together as roommates. They introduced me to a ton of their gay and gay-friendly buddies on the island. They knew absolutely everyone and going to parties at their place was an absolutely eye-opening experience. Oahu's one of the few places in the US where each of the services (USN, USA, USMC, USAF and CG) maintains a sizeable presence. You'd go to their house parties and it would be 50 to 75 people crammed into a tiny apartment having a few drinks, flirting and dancing to some music. Most of them would be gay and all of them would be military. There were A TON of gays and lesbians from all five services, each of them amply represented. The one rule N-- and K-- had was that everyone at their parties had to be enlisted, no officers ( fraternization was the one thing they had a healthy fear of). Most of us were young (early 20's) and we had a lot of fun- mostly harmless flirting, etc. P.S. ONCE in a while we'd see an officer but it was an extremely unusual exception. I was enlisted at the time so it didn't really affect me but when I was transitioning into becoming an officer it was the one thing that gave me pause. Was I going to be doomed to a life of professional and personal loneliness?",

I started to blog to express the aggravation, fear and frustration that Don't Ask, Don't Tell forces on Gay and Lesbian families like mine. It would be good to have access to the Base support services. I really don't have any idea what they would be, but I imagine things like spousal and family phone trees, potlucks and various other gatherings, counseling; the benefit of sharing with others going through similar things. Fair is not a word I use much anymore. There is no guarantee of fairness in this life. There are those who will sympathize with me, those who scold me that I knew what I was getting into, and even those will who tell me I shouldn't have any 'special rights'. What I think, however, is that it is just plain cruelty. It's cruel that a good soldier, who has been shot at, rocketed, mortared since his first day on duty in Iraq never got to say a proper goodbye to the person he loves. Instead, with our daughter in the backseat, we pulled behind a warehouse at the edge of the base, stepped out of the car and held each other briefly in the pouring rain. The rain started to change to snow. I dropped him a bit away from the main gate, so that nobody would see me, and he walked alone in the sleet to report for duty. I held it together so that he could make that walk without looking back in worry. I held it together because I didn't want our daughter to be scared as I screamed and pounded my fists on the steering wheel.

They were a GREAT couple- super stable, fun and politically conservative ( !!?? I assumed it's cuz he went to the Academy which automatically made him a tool, right? lol ).

For about a year and half, we had a blast, just a bunch of guys hanging out in their off time, doing their thing. Anyway, my rotation date was coming up and I was getting ready to ship out and the young guy says to me, \"Y'know, Frank. I'm thinking about joining the Navy.

        "content": "Okay I still get a chuckle over this one. I was a C-130 Crew Chief for the California ANG. I used to go on a lot of trips. I often took junior crew chiefs on those trips as trainees. One particular trip I was asked by a fairly new airman who had transfered from active duty if he could go with me. \"Dave\" seemed nice enough when I chatted with him, so I said sure. The trip was headed to Gulfport, MS. Not a real hotspot, but not very far from New Orleans. I'd never be to N.O., and thought it would be fun to rent a car and drive over to go clubing. (Yeah...I was MUCH younger then) So we land in Gulfport and Dave and I stay behind to close up the aircraft while the aircrew beat feet. After we finished we went to billeting to check in. I promptly ditched Dave and got in my rental car and headed out. I'm walking around on Bourbon street and finally find a club. Turns out its a guys club, but there's a drag show going on. What fun!!! So, anyways, I'm there for about 30 minutes when I feel this tap, tap, tap on my shoulder. I turn around and theres Dave. He looks at me and says \"biotch...do you know how much that cab just cost me?\" I cracked up. Turns out while my gaydar was a bit rusty, Dave's was spot on. After that we took several trips together. What a blast having someone to hang with.",

        "content": "My memory of an incident was during my active duty 68-70. I was in PNCLAFLA and just coming to terms with my own sexuality. I was reaching out to the local community and learning. I heard of an annual beach party that was a blast and decided to go. The night before I had a house party for friends and guests. Those days it was more of a drinking bash though some were smoking the dreaded 'weed.' One of the guys. I will call Joe, stayed over and hung around during the day. I was trying to get rid of him as I wanted to go to this party. I tried most methods rather then outright saying I don't want you to join me. So, we went together to PNCLAFLA beach. Now this was way before today, where building was just beginning. Once onto the beach road and I passed by the location there were cars on both sides of the road for blocks and blocks. I thought, what a crowd this will be. We parked finally and started walking on the moonlight beach towards the torch lighted party. I could see folks laying on towels and figured they were guys laying side by side, but not sure. Once we got to the party, it was a full blown blast with large torches, tables of buffet type eats and kegs of beer. And, there were only guys! I ended up seeing some of my navy collegues, whom I had not known as gay before sitting along the sand. We joined them and I was just hoping nothing would happen. Joe asked me why there were \"only guys\" at this party. I said, I don't know, I think this is a fraternity party. Joe joined me & my other friends. Suddenly, this Joe jumped up and said he was leaving. Apparently some other guy had made a pass at him. I didn't know what to say or do. I just acted 'surprised' and questioned if he did't mis-undersand because of the drinking. He walked off and I went after saying that it is a long way back and I didn't want to leave. He said that was fine. So, I returned back to my friends....and within 10-15\" Joe returned. Not saying much but joining in on the conversation. I told my friends that he was st8 and not to bother him. Later, we walked as a group along the beach and decided to go skinny dipping. I was trying to alert everyone not to do anything funny as 'Joe' was not a club member. We frolicked in the water for awhile and when I came out I was still alerting the other guys. Finally one said.....oh really. I just kissed him out in the water and he didn't seem to mind! I was appalled. I didn't know how he would be when getting out of the water. As he approached he seemed to be in a jolly mood as the others. As time went, we continued to party...me leaving alone and my friend 'Joe' leaving with a new found friend!",

        "content": "oh wow. I didn't know it had been kicking it there for so long (you mentioned going b/t '68 and '70). Right on. For those of you who don't know, one of the largest gay beach parties in the South happens every Memorial Day down there, in Pensacola, FL ( mark your calendars,kids. It's coming up! ). Well, in Pensacola, purely by coincidence I'm sure, there just happens to be a huge military training command. From what I remember all Navy and USMC aviators (some AF, too), EOD dive schools,and a bunch of aviation related A schools are situated there. I had a friend who was an instructor on one of the bases down there. He owned a house in the area and for a couple of years running, people we knew in the service would converge at his place for that particular weekend. It was fun but it wasn't really my thing. There's miles and miles of gay people lining the beaches and a huge circuit party in the convention center (go figure!). The one thing I remember about going with some friends one time was the Evangelical protesters standing on the street corners outside with their signs reading \" Repent, ye sinners! \" lol. I swear it was like that joke where a clown looks into a door or somn and there's another clown there that mirrors their every move. They both think it's a mirror until one of them does somn different! We gawked at them, they gawked at us. We pointed at them, they pointed at us. We joked about them, they joked about us. They saw us laughing and we started talking and it turns out they were from some big bible college in the area. They weren't so bad. We quoted the bible at each other for a few minutes before agreeing to disagree. They were just stupid young kids like we were. We wound up taking pictures with them and their protest signs before going inside the big party. Pretty cool. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Frank_A_Valdez, Wed 06 May 2009 05:54 PM",
