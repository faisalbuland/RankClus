The abrupt shakeup came a year after Fidel Castro handed the presidency to his younger brother because of poor health. It was announced at the end of the midday news, after the weather and sports. Perhaps the most prominent of those ousted, Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, was the youngest of Cuba's top leaders and had been widely mentioned as a possible future president. Perez Roque, 43, was replaced by his own deputy, Bruno Rodriguez. >http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/02/world/main4838829.shtml I wonder what else will change.",

Felipe Perez Roque is a charismatic man who commands quite a following. his youth has been his card up the sleeve. he is closer in touch with the new needs of Cuba, and has taken steps to insure some economic freedom once the castro family is gone. i guess it all boils down to \"what is in store for post castro Cuba\"?",
