'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/10/AR2009031002653.html?wprss=rss_politics' quote: The Senate gave final approval last night to a $410 billion spending bill to fund most of the federal government for the remainder of the year after overcoming a resilient Republican opposition and several Democratic defections. The bill, which includes thousands of controversial earmarks inserted by members of both parties, was approved on a voice vote after eight Republicans joined 54 Democrats in backing a procedural measure to bring the long and rancorous debate to a close. President Obama has indicated that he will sign the legislation despite having misgivings about the earmarks. \u2026 The measure would provide fiscal 2009 funding for nine federal departments, covering all government activities other than defense and homeland security-related agencies, whose funding was approved last fall. Many agencies would see big increases, in some cases 10 percent or more above fiscal 2008 levels. The bill represents a bonanza for federal agencies that felt a budget squeeze for much of Bush\u2019s two terms. Mass transit, public housing, the National Institutes of Health, Head Start and the Pell grant program are all among the Democratic priorities that would see new federal money flow into their coffers. The Food and Drug Administration would receive nearly $335 million more than it did in fiscal 2008. The supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, would grow by $1.2 billion, a 21 percent jump from the $5.7 billion appropriated last year. Another contentious provision targets the District's school voucher program, a Republican favorite that provides 1,700 low-income students with the equivalent of a $7,500 grant to attend a private school. Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) sought unsuccessfully to strike language from the bill that would require its reauthorization after the 2009-2010 school year, a move he said would leave current recipients in limbo. \"We're talking about real children here,\" Ensign said on the Senate floor before his amendment was defeated yesterday, pointing to a poster-size photo of two voucher beneficiaries at Sidwell Friends School, where Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, are students. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) defended the reauthorization requirement as a routine review to determine whether the voucher approach works. (\"Congress will take a look at the program and decide if the money is well spent,\" he said.) Thats laughable! Now they're going to start doing that!? Wonder if the NEA will help him The independent watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense found 8,570 disclosed earmarks in the bill, worth $7.7 billion. Only five senators did not add pet projects to the measure, including Republicans McCain, Jim DeMint (S.C.) and Tom Coburn (Okla.), and Democrats Feingold and McCaskill. Walking the walk",

It wasn\u2019t on my watch. (as always, blame Bush -ed.) And it wasn\u2019t on my watch that we passed a massive new entitlement -\u2013 the prescription drug plan -- without a source of funding. And so I think it\u2019s important just to note when you start hearing folks throw these words around that we\u2019ve actually been operating in a way that has been entirely consistent with free-market principles and that some of the same folks who are throwing the word 'socialist' around can\u2019t say the same.\" The buck stops....

        "content": "Dear Republican Supporter, It's official. Last night, the United States Senate officially passed the massive $410 billion omnibus spending bill. And coming on the heels of the recently-passed \"stimulus\" package, the overall total for both bills exceeds more than $1.6 trillion of taxpayer money, including interest. Senate Republicans tried their best to stop this flawed legislation, but with the Democrats on the verge of a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority, Harry Reid and his left-wing allies were able to force this bill through. That's why I need you to stand with the NRSC today by contributing $10, $15, $25 or even $50 to help elect more Republicans to the Senate. With your help and support we can stop this heavy handed one party rule in Washington and curb the Democrats' seemingly insatiable appetite for spending. Should Harry Reid gain his 60th seat in the Senate, Democrats will drive our economy in the wrong direction and our country further into debt. With our economy already hurting, our country simply cannot afford Democrats' reckless fiscal policies. The 60th vote ensures we will have no ability to affect Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi's left-wing agenda. Should they succeed, we risk mortgaging the future of our beloved country. Your contribution today is the very first step toward ensuring that Republicans retain the ability to check the Democrats' agenda. Stand with me and the NRSC as we fight to elect fiscally responsible Republicans to the Senate. Please make a donation of $10, $15, $25, or more right now. Sincerely, Senator John Cornyn Chairman National Republican Senatorial Committee PS: If Harry Reid gets his way and gains the 60 seat majority he so desperately wants in the Senate, there will be no way for us to stop the liberal's out of control spending in Washington. Please help the NRSC in electing fiscally responsible Republicans to the Senate in 2010 to stop Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid from taking total control and using unchecked power to advance their extremist agenda of EVEN LARGER perpetual bailouts that Americans don't want. Thank you. - John",

Earmarks in and of themselves are actually a good thing because they actually account for where exactly that money will go. The more earmarks, the more accountability. Earmarks do not change how much the bill costs, they just say in writing where a portion of that money will be spent. So, really, there should be many more earmarks. However, it is what the earmarks are for in some cases that is not a good thing (i.e. pet projects, bridges to nowhere, etc). You should attack what the earmarks are for, not the fact that there are earmarks. You all remember that TARP funds, right? There was not one earmark in that bill. So, instead of having accountability on where each and every dollar was spent, we just gave the Treasury a lump sum. The result was that nobody knows where all of the money went. What do you expect if you don't account for every dollar in a bill? If somebody gave me a lump sum of free cash without stipulations on how to spend it, I am going to spend it however in the heck I want. Simple as that. If whoever that gave me that lump sum gets mad at me for how I spent it, too bad. It is their fault for not earmarking how that money was to be spent.",
