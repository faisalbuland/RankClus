Lesbian mom to be deported Friday Immigration Equality is calling on legislators to act on behalf of a Northern California family that may soon be torn apart because the parents are lesbians. Because immigration laws discriminate against lesbian and gay couples, Shirley Tan will likely be deported this Friday, April 3. Tanwill be separated from her life partner Jaylynn \u201cJay\u201d Mercado, their 12-year-old twin sons, and Jay\u2019s 76-year-old mother, for whom Tanis the primary caretaker. The deportation will send Tan back to the Philippines, where she was a victim of extreme violence. \u201cFrom the moment my sons were born we have never been apart. It\u2019s tearing me apart to have to leave without them,\u201d Tan said. Unlike straight Americans, Mercado cannot sponsor her partner of 23 years for immigration. The Uniting American Families Act (UAFA) would remedy this discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans and allow them to sponsor their partners for immigration. The bill, introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy in the Senate and Rep. Jerrold Nadler in the House, has 110 cosponsors in Congress. \u201cUntil the UAFA passes, families like Jay and Shirley\u2019s are at terrible risk,\u201d said Immigration Equality Executive Director Rachel B. Tiven. \u201cWe are hopeful their members of Congress will introduce a private bill that would spare their twin boys and the boys\u2019 grandmother from having the country they love tear their family apart.\u201d Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Representative Jackie Speier (D-CA-12) represent Shirley and Jay in Congress. Boxer and Speier cosponsored the Uniting American Families Act. \u201cShirley Tan\u2019s unacceptable situation is just one example of why Congress must pass immigration equality legislation. The Uniting American Families Act, which I co-sponsored, will allow lesbian and gay Americans to sponsor their permanent partners for residency in the United States,\u201d Speier said. Across the country, 37,000 couples face similar circumstances. Last week, the White House issued a statement about the Uniting American Families Act, saying \u201c[President Obama] thinks Americans with partners from other countries should not be faced with a painful choice between staying with their partner or staying in their country.\u201d Immigration Equality is a national organization with offices in New York and Washington fighting for equality under U.S. immigration law for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and HIV-positive individuals. examiner.com/x-5328-Chicago-Page-One-Examiner~y2009m4d1-Lesbian-mom-to-be-deported-Friday",

        "content": "Seawitch, I think that all government jobs should be reserved for Veterans like yourself. I don't know the first thing about you, except you're a Veteran. I believe that most people think they're entitled to collect a paycheck, and are entitled to an office with an important position as soon as they turn 18. And there is more. They belong to Unions. The Unions are very smart. Thanks to their Unions, these non-veteran workers know just how much work to do so that its illegal to fire them. They dont' give one crap about helping people. They want the paycheck and the position, not the responsibilities. I say that the reason for the deportation is because of the laziness and sloth of the Government workers, because this administration is friendly to immigrants. I take serious issue with Government workers thinking they can get away with slothful work. They think people are just numbers. Veterans, on the other hand, know the meaning of an honest days work. Veterans are idealistic. They joined the military to serve their country, not becasue of the paycheck. Alot believed that when they got the call to deploy, they would be looking after the interests of the little guy. It is true that most mental war wounds are from things Veterans witnessed in combat. But I sincerely believe a high percentage of war wounds results from the fact that service people realize, only after deployment, that they are overseas to serve the interests of the Wall Street Kingpins. For these reasons, Veterans will carry the honesty they practiced in the military, and transfer it over to the real world. Veterans do not take things for granted. I sincerely believe that if Government positions, for social security were also reserved for Veterans, than the Social security system would not be in the mess its in. Here is my proposal on how all Government jobs should be reserved for Veterans, and weed out every single person who is in the position for themselves: If you're not a Veteran, and you still want the job, Immigration or otherwise, here are the requirements: 1. You must have paid for College out of your own pocket, not collected Financial Aid. This requirement weeds out people who want the Government position because they want to make alot of money. The fact that they have a job already, and paid for school, shows they already make enough money. 2. If you're a Veteran, the above rule does not apply to you. quote: Originally posted by SeaWitch1220: quote: Originally posted by liberal90: No, this is intensely stupid nativist garbage just like almost all of our immigration laws.

        "reply": "Seawitch, I think that all government jobs should be reserved for Veterans like yourself. I don't know the first thing about you, except you're a Veteran. I believe that most people think they're entitled to collect a paycheck, and are entitled to an office with an important position as soon as they turn 18. And there is more. They belong to Unions. The Unions are very smart. Thanks to their Unions, these non-veteran workers know just how much work to do so that its illegal to fire them. They dont' give one crap about helping people. They want the paycheck and the position, not the responsibilities. I say that the reason for the deportation is because of the laziness and sloth of the Government workers, because this administration is friendly to immigrants. I take serious issue with Government workers thinking they can get away with slothful work. They think people are just numbers. Veterans, on the other hand, know the meaning of an honest days work. Veterans are idealistic. They joined the military to serve their country, not becasue of the paycheck. Alot believed that when they got the call to deploy, they would be looking after the interests of the little guy. It is true that most mental war wounds are from things Veterans witnessed in combat. But I sincerely believe a high percentage of war wounds results from the fact that service people realize, only after deployment, that they are overseas to serve the interests of the Wall Street Kingpins. For these reasons, Veterans will carry the honesty they practiced in the military, and transfer it over to the real world. Veterans do not take things for granted. I sincerely believe that if Government positions, for social security were also reserved for Veterans, than the Social security system would not be in the mess its in. Here is my proposal on how all Government jobs should be reserved for Veterans, and weed out every single person who is in the position for themselves: If you're not a Veteran, and you still want the job, Immigration or otherwise, here are the requirements: 1. You must have paid for College out of your own pocket, not collected Financial Aid. This requirement weeds out people who want the Government position because they want to make alot of money. The fact that they have a job already, and paid for school, shows they already make enough money. 2. If you're a Veteran, the above rule does not apply to you.  This message has been edited.

Lesbian mom to be deported Friday Immigration Equality is calling on legislators to act on behalf of a Northern California family that may soon be torn apart because the parents are lesbians. Because immigration laws discriminate against lesbian and gay couples, Shirley Tan will likely be deported this Friday, April 3. Tanwill be separated from her life partner Jaylynn \u201cJay\u201d Mercado, their 12-year-old twin sons, and Jay\u2019s 76-year-old mother, for whom Tanis the primary caretaker. The deportation will send Tan back to the Philippines, where she was a victim of extreme violence. \u201cFrom the moment my sons were born we have never been apart. It\u2019s tearing me apart to have to leave without them,\u201d Tan said. Unlike straight Americans, Mercado cannot sponsor her partner of 23 years for immigration. The Uniting American Families Act (UAFA) would remedy this discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans and allow them to sponsor their partners for immigration. The bill, introduced by Sen.

The Unions are very smart. Thanks to their Unions, these non-veteran workers know just how much work to do so that its illegal to fire them. They dont' give one crap about helping people. They want the paycheck and the position, not the responsibilities. I say that the reason for the deportation is because of the laziness and sloth of the Government workers, because this administration is friendly to immigrants. I take serious issue with Government workers thinking they can get away with slothful work. They think people are just numbers. Veterans, on the other hand, know the meaning of an honest days work. Veterans are idealistic. They joined the military to serve their country, not becasue of the paycheck. Alot believed that when they got the call to deploy, they would be looking after the interests of the little guy. It is true that most mental war wounds are from things Veterans witnessed in combat. But I sincerely believe a high percentage of war wounds results from the fact that service people realize, only after deployment, that they are overseas to serve the interests of the Wall Street Kingpins. For these reasons, Veterans will carry the honesty they practiced in the military, and transfer it over to the real world. Veterans do not take things for granted. I sincerely believe that if Government positions, for social security were also reserved for Veterans, than the Social security system would not be in the mess its in. Here is my proposal on how all Government jobs should be reserved for Veterans, and weed out every single person who is in the position for themselves: If you're not a Veteran, and you still want the job, Immigration or otherwise, here are the requirements: 1. You must have paid for College out of your own pocket, not collected Financial Aid. This requirement weeds out people who want the Government position because they want to make alot of money. The fact that they have a job already, and paid for school, shows they already make enough money. 2. If you're a Veteran, the above rule does not apply to you. quote: Originally posted by SeaWitch1220: quote: Originally posted by liberal90: No, this is intensely stupid nativist garbage just like almost all of our immigration laws.

Lesbian mom to be deported Friday Immigration Equality is calling on legislators to act on behalf of a Northern California family that may soon be torn apart because the parents are lesbians.

Tanwill be separated from her life partner Jaylynn \u201cJay\u201d Mercado, their 12-year-old twin sons, and Jay\u2019s 76-year-old mother, for whom Tanis the primary caretaker.

I believe that most people think they're entitled to collect a paycheck, and are entitled to an office with an important position as soon as they turn 18. And there is more. They belong to Unions. The Unions are very smart. Thanks to their Unions, these non-veteran workers know just how much work to do so that its illegal to fire them. They dont' give one crap about helping people. They want the paycheck and the position, not the responsibilities. I say that the reason for the deportation is because of the laziness and sloth of the Government workers, because this administration is friendly to immigrants. I take serious issue with Government workers thinking they can get away with slothful work. They think people are just numbers. Veterans, on the other hand, know the meaning of an honest days work. Veterans are idealistic. They joined the military to serve their country, not becasue of the paycheck. Alot believed that when they got the call to deploy, they would be looking after the interests of the little guy. It is true that most mental war wounds are from things Veterans witnessed in combat. But I sincerely believe a high percentage of war wounds results from the fact that service people realize, only after deployment, that they are overseas to serve the interests of the Wall Street Kingpins. For these reasons, Veterans will carry the honesty they practiced in the military, and transfer it over to the real world. Veterans do not take things for granted. I sincerely believe that if Government positions, for social security were also reserved for Veterans, than the Social security system would not be in the mess its in. Here is my proposal on how all Government jobs should be reserved for Veterans, and weed out every single person who is in the position for themselves: If you're not a Veteran, and you still want the job, Immigration or otherwise, here are the requirements: 1. You must have paid for College out of your own pocket, not collected Financial Aid. This requirement weeds out people who want the Government position because they want to make alot of money. The fact that they have a job already, and paid for school, shows they already make enough money. 2. If you're a Veteran, the above rule does not apply to you. quote: Originally posted by SeaWitch1220: quote: Originally posted by liberal90: No, this is intensely stupid nativist garbage just like almost all of our immigration laws.

Right, because things like that don't happen. \"She and her family even received a security clearance to tour the White House in 2005,\" said Beech, a Fresno attorney who took over Tan's case this year. \"They checked her fingerprints and never said there was a deportation order outstanding.\" \"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/02/MNSF16QV9B.DTL\"",

Since her asylum request was denied in 2002 and allegedly nobody told her, she's been sitting around on her bupkis and hasn't inquired as to the status of her request?
