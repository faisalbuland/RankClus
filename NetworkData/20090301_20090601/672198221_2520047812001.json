Both their militaries are modeled after the British military and their government structure is modeled after the British. Would it make sense to have our closest ally help with the Kasmire problem? After all they were there for over 200 years and I sure they fully understand the Indians and Pakistanese; they Do have a large population of both in England now. Besides, I somewhat trust them more.",
