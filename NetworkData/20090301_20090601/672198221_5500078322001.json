The source, who was not cleared to speak with the media and would not be identified, said the U.S. government would pay for the assets by assuming the automaker's $6 billion of secured debt and forgiving the bulk of the $15.4 billion of emergency loans that the U.S. Treasury has provided to GM.

Is that \"just loaning money?\" Restricting compensation of management is just \"loaning money?\" What about taking away the board members voting rights on the board? Why have them there and not outright remove them? Because then there might be a lawsuit. These dudes that work at GMAC and GM are just as guilty as this administration It is our money bailing out the union employees, CEO's, and management. We will ensure the clowns who put themselves billions of dollars in the hole get their pension. How insane is this? The union gets a crapload of money for putting cars together as is, the sups and execs get a crapload of money marketing cars\u2026meanwhile they are losing profit. The union wants more the execs want more they all get what they want and they lose money faster as a company. I am paying for that turd on the line putting lug nuts on a wheel at what ever $$ amount. I am paying for that exec to keep his mansion\u2026meanwhile my taxes are not reduced in the slightest dwindling my chances of sending my kids to a decent non-public school. WTF is that all about????? Then in steps the government\u2026we loan them money at first with no stipulation other than it will be paid back with interest\u2026bad move on our part. Now we loan them MORE and MORE money and try to dictate with mandates what to build. WTF is THAT? You can slice that dirt pie any way you want grachus but when you boil all the fat away, government run/controlled/owned is socialism.",

Dave I also thought the government would accept money from the financial institutions that received bailout money to pay it back. That hasn't turned out quite the way I expected. If a bank (company management) wants to pay back quickly so management can start getting their big bonuses again (current case) and doing so carries a significant risk that bank would get in financial trouble again should they be allowed to pay back the money or should they have to wait until they are in a better financial state? How many of these banks would still want to pay back quickly if management would still have to wait before they could start getting bonuses again? IMO NONE.",

The source, who was not cleared to speak with the media and would not be identified, said the U.S. government would pay for the assets by assuming the automaker's $6 billion of secured debt and forgiving the bulk of the $15.4 billion of emergency loans that the U.S. Treasury has provided to GM.
