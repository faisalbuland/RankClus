Second, the government probably should have never given any bailout money to GM too. In a small way, GM and Wagoner built what the public was demanding--SUV's and Van's--both family oriented like sedans were not. That was a business decision. Along with this, is the news that Chrysler is being 'forced' into a merger with Fiat! Why is the government forcing a US company into having a controlling interest with a foreign company? Could it have happened anyway? Probably! It already happened to Chrysler once with Mercedes Benz--but they saw the light and got out! But, at the risk of straying here (and I don't think I am), this leads to another US company being controlled by a foreign company such as: Firestone-now Bridgestone-a Japanese Company; Miller Brewing-now owned by South African Company.

You are correct as stated in the following: (Quote) Chrysler's potential deal with Fiat has a couple of requirements: Fiat's ownership must initially be less than the 35% US Government stake in the company, and it's not to rise above 49% until the new loan money is fully repaid. Chrysler will be provided up to $6 billion in additional working capital during the restructuring period.(Quote)Whether it's leverage or not, it is to a degree, protecting some of the stimulus money they received.

Why is the government forcing a US company into having a controlling interest with a foreign company? Could it have happened anyway? Probably! It already happened to Chrysler once with Mercedes Benz--but they saw the light and got out! I don't think that is quite accurate. My understanding is that the government is putting constraints on how much of Chrysler can be owned by Fiat as long as Chrysler owes money to the government. I believe the condition is essentially that Fiat will \"own\" no more of Chrysler than what the government owns ... in other words, the government is preserving its leverage.

You are correct as stated in the following: (Quote) Chrysler's potential deal with Fiat has a couple of requirements: Fiat's ownership must initially be less than the 35% US Government stake in the company, and it's not to rise above 49% until the new loan money is fully repaid. Chrysler will be provided up to $6 billion in additional working capital during the restructuring period.(Quote)Whether it's leverage or not, it is to a degree, protecting some of the stimulus money they received.

The decision to ask G.M.\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner, to resign caught Detroit and Washington by surprise, and it underscored the Obama administration\u2019s determination to keep a tight rein on the companies it is bailing out \u2014 a level of government involvement in business perhaps not seen since the Great Depression.

Second, the government probably should have never given any bailout money to GM too. In a small way, GM and Wagoner built what the public was demanding--SUV's and Van's--both family oriented like sedans were not. That was a business decision. Along with this, is the news that Chrysler is being 'forced' into a merger with Fiat! Why is the government forcing a US company into having a controlling interest with a foreign company? Could it have happened anyway? Probably! It already happened to Chrysler once with Mercedes Benz--but they saw the light and got out! But, at the risk of straying here (and I don't think I am), this leads to another US company being controlled by a foreign company such as: Firestone-now Bridgestone-a Japanese Company; Miller Brewing-now owned by South African Company.

You are correct as stated in the following: (Quote) Chrysler's potential deal with Fiat has a couple of requirements: Fiat's ownership must initially be less than the 35% US Government stake in the company, and it's not to rise above 49% until the new loan money is fully repaid. Chrysler will be provided up to $6 billion in additional working capital during the restructuring period.(Quote)Whether it's leverage or not, it is to a degree, protecting some of the stimulus money they received.
