But now's the time for another increase, Rep. Terese Berceau (D-Madison) said Wednesday. She's asking lawmakers to consider supporting a bill to take the beer tax from $2 a barrel of beer to $10 a barrel, which means an increase of about 2 1/2 cents a bottle. \"Wisconsin has a drinking problem of national renown that is killing people and ruining lives, and government in Wisconsin has been an enabler,\" Berceau said at a Capitol news conference with co-sponsor Sen. Fred Risser (D-Madison), law enforcement and health care professionals. Risser noted that he's the only state legislator who was in office in 1969, when the last beer tax increase became law. The proposal is unlikely to become law. Gov. Jim Doyle opposes it, and similar proposals in the past have died for lack of support. Wisconsin's tax is the country's third lowest, and the state has one of the highest rates of binge drinking and drunken driving crashes, supporters said. The state also has high alcohol-related health care costs, they said. Now is the wrong time to even consider such a tax increase, said Scott Stenger, lobbyist for the Tavern League of Wisconsin, which opposes the beer tax increase. Taverns are seeing a significant decline in business because of the ongoing financial slump, he said. The proposed beer tax increase would bring in about $40 million in new revenue a year, according to figures on Berceau's Web site. The new funds would go toward increased drunken driving enforcement and alcohol abuse prevention and treatment.",

But now's the time for another increase, Rep. Terese Berceau (D-Madison) said Wednesday. She's asking lawmakers to consider supporting a bill to take the beer tax from $2 a barrel of beer to $10 a barrel, which means an increase of about 2 1/2 cents a bottle. \"Wisconsin has a drinking problem of national renown that is killing people and ruining lives, and government in Wisconsin has been an enabler,\" Berceau said at a Capitol news conference with co-sponsor Sen. Fred Risser (D-Madison), law enforcement and health care professionals. Risser noted that he's the only state legislator who was in office in 1969, when the last beer tax increase became law. The proposal is unlikely to become law. Gov. Jim Doyle opposes it, and similar proposals in the past have died for lack of support. Wisconsin's tax is the country's third lowest, and the state has one of the highest rates of binge drinking and drunken driving crashes, supporters said. The state also has high alcohol-related health care costs, they said. Now is the wrong time to even consider such a tax increase, said Scott Stenger, lobbyist for the Tavern League of Wisconsin, which opposes the beer tax increase. Taverns are seeing a significant decline in business because of the ongoing financial slump, he said. The proposed beer tax increase would bring in about $40 million in new revenue a year, according to figures on Berceau's Web site. The new funds would go toward increased drunken driving enforcement and alcohol abuse prevention and treatment.",
