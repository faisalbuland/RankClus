The problem is he had diarrhea but didn't know it till right then. I guess y'all can figure out what happened. Everyone in the class was laughing so hadt the teacher dismissed us and the kid's mother couldn't get him to go back to school for a week. He never did live it down. Ended up his parents moved to a different town where they were unknown. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",
