I primarily shoot .22 cal bench and .45 pistol and purely for my personal enjoyment. Although I consistently shoot 1/2 inch groups with the .22 at 50 yards and 6-8 inch groups at 20 yards with my .45 acp, I do not consider my skills anywhere near competition level. While I do share your concern about the current shortage of ammunition and reloading materials, I fail to see how this relates to your topic heading that this is somehow a politically motivated gun grab. My personal take on this is that it is a market driven result of the past few months rush on firearms and the current hoarding of ammunition. The rush on firearms has abated at the present time and prices are starting to fall, but finding ammunition is becoming an issue now. Even my favorite .22 match ammunition is very difficult to find and the price has increased by at least 10%. And, none of my firearms are used for criminal activities either. In conclusion, neither you nor I have any real knowledge of why the DoD made this decision and can only speculate as to whether or not it was politically motivated. However, in any case it is a very far stretch to equate this decision to a leftist politically motivated effort to take our firearms. That kind of Chicken Little rhetoric only serves to muddy the issue which ultimately hurts our goal of being able to continue to enjoy our hobby. Peace, out",

Anyone ever come and get your guns during your vast experience?

        "reply": "\"http://www.govliquidation.com\" Dear Valued Customer: Please take a moment to note important changes set forth by the Defense Logistics Agency: Recently it has been determined that fired munitions of all calibers, shapes and sizes have been designated to be Demil code B. As a result and in conjunction with DLA's current Demil code B policy, this notice will serve as official notification which requires Scrap Venture (SV) to implement mutilation as a condition of sale for all sales of fired munitions effective immediately. This notice also requires SV to immediately cease delivery of any fired munitions that have been recently sold or on active term contracts, unless the material has been mutilated prior to sale or SV personnel can attest to the mutilation after delivery. A certificate of destruction is required in either case. Thank you, DOD Surplus 15051 N Kierland Blvd # 300 Scottsdale, AZ 85254 whatever it takes, whatever is needed, they will remove your right to have a firearm... and this guy has how many months left",

I primarily shoot .22 cal bench and .45 pistol and purely for my personal enjoyment. Although I consistently shoot 1/2 inch groups with the .22 at 50 yards and 6-8 inch groups at 20 yards with my .45 acp, I do not consider my skills anywhere near competition level. While I do share your concern about the current shortage of ammunition and reloading materials, I fail to see how this relates to your topic heading that this is somehow a politically motivated gun grab. My personal take on this is that it is a market driven result of the past few months rush on firearms and the current hoarding of ammunition. The rush on firearms has abated at the present time and prices are starting to fall, but finding ammunition is becoming an issue now. Even my favorite .22 match ammunition is very difficult to find and the price has increased by at least 10%. And, none of my firearms are used for criminal activities either. In conclusion, neither you nor I have any real knowledge of why the DoD made this decision and can only speculate as to whether or not it was politically motivated. However, in any case it is a very far stretch to equate this decision to a leftist politically motivated effort to take our firearms. That kind of Chicken Little rhetoric only serves to muddy the issue which ultimately hurts our goal of being able to continue to enjoy our hobby. Peace, out",

I primarily shoot .22 cal bench and .45 pistol and purely for my personal enjoyment. Although I consistently shoot 1/2 inch groups with the .22 at 50 yards and 6-8 inch groups at 20 yards with my .45 acp, I do not consider my skills anywhere near competition level. While I do share your concern about the current shortage of ammunition and reloading materials, I fail to see how this relates to your topic heading that this is somehow a politically motivated gun grab. My personal take on this is that it is a market driven result of the past few months rush on firearms and the current hoarding of ammunition. The rush on firearms has abated at the present time and prices are starting to fall, but finding ammunition is becoming an issue now. Even my favorite .22 match ammunition is very difficult to find and the price has increased by at least 10%. And, none of my firearms are used for criminal activities either. In conclusion, neither you nor I have any real knowledge of why the DoD made this decision and can only speculate as to whether or not it was politically motivated. However, in any case it is a very far stretch to equate this decision to a leftist politically motivated effort to take our firearms. That kind of Chicken Little rhetoric only serves to muddy the issue which ultimately hurts our goal of being able to continue to enjoy our hobby. Peace, out",
