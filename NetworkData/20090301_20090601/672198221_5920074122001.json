When elements of the military saw the interrogation plan being crafted by the White House, serious objections were raised. Those objections will be key to any prosecutions because they demonstrate that the White House should have been aware that what they were proposing was against the law. The architects of the torture program, however, seem aware of the power of those dissenting views and, according to the Senate report, repeatedly denied receiving them. Then-Captain and now-Rear Admiral Jane Dalton, for instance, told the committee that her staff discussed the military's concerns with DoD General Counsel Jim Haynes, one of the architects of the program, and that he was aware of the military's objections. Haynes, meanwhile, testified that he didn't know that the military was opposed and had written memos to that effect. He later qualified that denial to say he wasn't \"sure\" that he hadn't been made aware. His deputy, Eliana Davidson, also told him his torture project \"needed further assessment,\" but Haynes, again, said he didn't recall Davidson telling him that. As early as November 2002, the military was pushing back. The Air Force cited \"serious concerns regarding the legality of many of the proposed techniques\" because they \"may be subject to challenge as failing to meet the requirements outlined in the military order to treat detainees humanely.\" The top legal adviser to the Criminal Investigation Task Force weighed in, arguing that the techniques \"may subject service members to punitive articles of the [Uniform Code of Military Justice].\" The \"utility and legality of applying certain techniques\" was, the lawyer advised, \"questionable.\" Getting more to the point, he added that he couldn't \"advocate any action, interrogation or otherwise, that is predicated upon the principle that all is well if the ends justify the means and others are not aware of how we conduct our business.\" ... The Navy wanted further review and the Marine Corps expressed \"strong reservations,\" saying the request to torture wasn't \"legally sufficient.\" The proposed techniques \"arguably violate federal law, and would expose our service members to possible prosecution.\" Taking in the concerns, the top legal counsel to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Capt. Jane Dalton, proposed a thorough review before approving the new methods. It wasn't to be. Chairman Richard Myers met with Haynes, Dalton told the committee, and returned to tell her to kill her review on Haynes' order. Haynes was concerned that a broader review would allow the military's reservations to leak out. Of course, both Myers and Haynes denied any knowledge of the meeting Dalton referred to and denied telling her to cut short her review. Tellingly, however, the committee reports that \"neither has challenged Captain Dalton's recollection.\" It was the only time Dalton had ever been told to cut short a review, she told the committee. Despite the broad and deep concerns within the military, Haynes recommended to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that the bulk of the practices be approved. On December 2, Rumsfeld signed off, famously scribbling in the margins: \"I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to 4 hours?\" More on the Huffington Post. Walt",

The architects of the torture program, however, seem aware of the power of those dissenting views and, according to the Senate report, repeatedly denied receiving them. Then-Captain and now-Rear Admiral Jane Dalton, for instance, told the committee that her staff discussed the military's concerns with DoD General Counsel Jim Haynes, one of the architects of the program, and that he was aware of the military's objections. Haynes, meanwhile, testified that he didn't know that the military was opposed and had written memos to that effect. He later qualified that denial to say he wasn't \"sure\" that he hadn't been made aware. His deputy, Eliana Davidson, also told him his torture project \"needed further assessment,\" but Haynes, again, said he didn't recall Davidson telling him that. As early as November 2002, the military was pushing back. The Air Force cited \"serious concerns regarding the legality of many of the proposed techniques\" because they \"may be subject to challenge as failing to meet the requirements outlined in the military order to treat detainees humanely.\" The top legal adviser to the Criminal Investigation Task Force weighed in, arguing that the techniques \"may subject service members to punitive articles of the [Uniform Code of Military Justice].\" The \"utility and legality of applying certain techniques\" was, the lawyer advised, \"questionable.\" Getting more to the point, he added that he couldn't \"advocate any action, interrogation or otherwise, that is predicated upon the principle that all is well if the ends justify the means and others are not aware of how we conduct our business.\" ... The Navy wanted further review and the Marine Corps expressed \"strong reservations,\" saying the request to torture wasn't \"legally sufficient.\" The proposed techniques \"arguably violate federal law, and would expose our service members to possible prosecution.\" Taking in the concerns, the top legal counsel to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Capt. Jane Dalton, proposed a thorough review before approving the new methods. It wasn't to be. Chairman Richard Myers met with Haynes, Dalton told the committee, and returned to tell her to kill her review on Haynes' order. Haynes was concerned that a broader review would allow the military's reservations to leak out. Of course, both Myers and Haynes denied any knowledge of the meeting Dalton referred to and denied telling her to cut short her review. Tellingly, however, the committee reports that \"neither has challenged Captain Dalton's recollection.\" It was the only time Dalton had ever been told to cut short a review, she told the committee. Despite the broad and deep concerns within the military, Haynes recommended to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that the bulk of the practices be approved.

Now if for some reason and this country were to be invaded (I know most of you laugh at that one right) Hmmmmm, Does Pearl Habor and 9/11 ring any bells...they were trying.. But if they did and you knew your son, daughter, father, mother or another family member was torture, what would you do, when and if you got your hands on one of them? Kiss them on the cheek? Remember know we are being invaded and there are no more courts to go to, what would you do? Let them go free? turn the other cheek? Say thats alright..I forgive you, then you let him go free and you turn your back and now you have a knife in it and he turns you around with glea in his eye as he guts you!!! War is War, period...there is no nice way to conduct a war and be a winner...every since Korea, we have back out and have become weaker and weaker, to the point we aren't fear any more, they know there are folks like you all, who have no guts to fight anything longer then a week or two. Then you give up and whine and want to go home...it doesn't matter how many of us has been touture, not one bit, you just want to go home... Well someday gentlemen, that won't be an option, for you will have no home...",

We signed the Geneva Convention, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights...how many agreements and treaties do we have to violate before we question our methods? no they were convicted for using torture that lead to the death of a number of pows... also real torture not this waterboarding crap that isnt really torture waterboarding was just one of many things that were done to the pows.... and waterboarding has been used since and nothing was ever said about it till bush became in office... so do any of you support bring all potus to trail because it has been used in the past for at lease the beginning of our country... no of course not just bush because thats who you people hate.... just a load of bollocks... Waterboarding is torture your wrong. The only real expert we have on the issue, John McCain has said that as well...the man you wanted to be your President. Not all the POWs that were waterboarded died, McCain is an obvious one. Now you are arguing against the military leaders that said they did not want to do it for the sake of continuing support of who? \"W\"? I hope they do take some to trial now, just to prove a point. Bet they loose what ya think ? it has only recently become labeled torture by the liberals today... its been done since way back even before this country was even founded but now it is just become a problem,... funny that no one said a damn thing about it when clinton was in office but now bush gets in and all the haters come out and want this or that anythjing to try to on bush.... but yet they wont say a damn thing about any other potus in which waterboarding was done under... its not torture if you want real torture go and read about what saddam use to do to people... now maybe water boarding is torture when you use acid instead of water... guess i better sue first choice haircrafters and bring them up on war crime charges...hehehe... We also used to have slavery and we also executed people thought to be witches. That isn't an excuse to allow those things today. There is no doubt waterboarding falls within the definition of torture, and there is just no place for it. The mere perception of us using torture is enough for terrorists to pick up new recruits. It also severely damages any ability to get people with information to come forward and gives insurgents a good reason to fight to te death instead of surrendering. Who is going to surrender when they believe they will be tortured. Torture doesn't save lives it costs lives.",

Who KSM says was going to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge with a blowtorch. Who knows how many lives he saved from being hit with all those sparks? Too bad Faris had decided not to do it long before KSM was even in custody. Him being an FBI double agent probably had something to do with it too.
