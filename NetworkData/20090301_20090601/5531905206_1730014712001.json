Haliburton is the Name I think. <So whats your opinion> Cheney has never had any loyalty to anything but his own bank account. I may not have liked many of Bush's policies or decisions, but in the very least, I always believed that he actually cared about the United States. Cheney, on the other hand... why should this surprise anyone? He never cared about the United States, nor anyone else. Was he just in it for the money? Of course. Will financial justice ever be served? Well... I don't really have any faith in that, but it would be nice to see karma come full circle.",
