Sure, this kid was acting alone, but where did these ideas come from? If he just wanted to murder, why was he interrogating the victims about their religions before pulling the trigger? And why would he feel that a Catholic was non-Christian, to the point of deserving death for being Catholic? Another point to note: Colorado is a hot-spot for Christian fundamentalist groups. Are these groups guilty of violence? NO. Have they potentially created a climate that could lead to violence amongst their unstable followers? Perhaps. I mean, heck, whether or not you love, hate, or ignore PZ Meyers (I only went to his blog today because a friend linked me to this article), it's interesting to note that he's been getting several DEATH THREATS each day from people claiming to be Christian. \"http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/i_get_email_34.php So, where is this new undercurrent of violence originating?

They have a psychotic break. Religion forms a large part of their identity already. Ergo, their flipping-out (to put it less than scientifically) winds up being at their place of worship, or involved religious language. Then again maybe there is a massive conspiracy somewhere.

The cat was believed to be Bonestroo's pet. Stabbed his pet cat to death. The cat must have been Jewish. There seems to be a growing undercurrent of militant Christians (not mainline Protestants or even most evangelicals, this is a different thing) that has created this violent mentality. Sure, this kid was acting alone, but where did these ideas come from? If he just wanted to murder, why was he interrogating the victims about their religions before pulling the trigger? And why would he feel that a Catholic was non-Christian, to the point of deserving death for being Catholic? Another point to note: Colorado is a hot-spot for Christian fundamentalist groups. Are these groups guilty of violence? NO. Have they potentially created a climate that could lead to violence amongst their unstable followers? Perhaps. I mean, heck, whether or not you love, hate, or ignore PZ Meyers (I only went to his blog today because a friend linked me to this article), it's interesting to note that he's been getting several DEATH THREATS each day from people claiming to be Christian. \"http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/i_get_email_34.php So, where is this new undercurrent of violence originating?

He then fled in his vehicle and proceeded to have a shootout with the police. quote: Authorities say Bonestroo was hit multiple times by the deputy's assault rifle before he fatally shot himself while sitting in his car, a few miles from the ski area. Ouch, that can't be good. Oh, and this part was really sick: quote: Among the list of items confiscated from Bonestroo's apartment were medication and a dead cat that was stabbed several times, Pelle said. The cat was believed to be Bonestroo's pet. Stabbed his pet cat to death. The cat must have been Jewish. There seems to be a growing undercurrent of militant Christians (not mainline Protestants or even most evangelicals, this is a different thing) that has created this violent mentality. Sure, this kid was acting alone, but where did these ideas come from? If he just wanted to murder, why was he interrogating the victims about their religions before pulling the trigger? And why would he feel that a Catholic was non-Christian, to the point of deserving death for being Catholic? Another point to note: Colorado is a hot-spot for Christian fundamentalist groups. Are these groups guilty of violence? NO. Have they potentially created a climate that could lead to violence amongst their unstable followers? Perhaps. I mean, heck, whether or not you love, hate, or ignore PZ Meyers (I only went to his blog today because a friend linked me to this article), it's interesting to note that he's been getting several DEATH THREATS each day from people claiming to be Christian. \"http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/i_get_email_34.php So, where is this new undercurrent of violence originating?

Ergo, their flipping-out (to put it less than scientifically) winds up being at their place of worship, or involved religious language. Then again maybe there is a massive conspiracy somewhere.

Mahon is believed to have died instantly. Other employees ran out the back door of the ski employee's meeting area and fled into the woods, describing an additional four to five shots being fired. Nice guy, huh? He then fled in his vehicle and proceeded to have a shootout with the police. quote: Authorities say Bonestroo was hit multiple times by the deputy's assault rifle before he fatally shot himself while sitting in his car, a few miles from the ski area. Ouch, that can't be good. Oh, and this part was really sick: quote: Among the list of items confiscated from Bonestroo's apartment were medication and a dead cat that was stabbed several times, Pelle said. The cat was believed to be Bonestroo's pet. Stabbed his pet cat to death. The cat must have been Jewish.

And why would he feel that a Catholic was non-Christian, to the point of deserving death for being Catholic? Another point to note: Colorado is a hot-spot for Christian fundamentalist groups. Are these groups guilty of violence? NO. Have they potentially created a climate that could lead to violence amongst their unstable followers? Perhaps. I mean, heck, whether or not you love, hate, or ignore PZ Meyers (I only went to his blog today because a friend linked me to this article), it's interesting to note that he's been getting several DEATH THREATS each day from people claiming to be Christian. \"http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/i_get_email_34.php So, where is this new undercurrent of violence originating?

You set the reader up to make the conclusion that while not actually violent or dangerous themselves, religious fundamentalists, religious folks, or the christian religion in that geographic area create a situation or act as a catalyst for violence. The conclusion you wished to be drawn was that religion presents a danger to society. Congratualtions. Your on the verge of declaring a \"thought\" a menace to society. How enlightened of you. And how cowardly as well, for \"on the verge\" is where you and others like you will stay for now. News? \"God is great God is great God is great BOOOOM!!!! GOD IS GREAT!!! GOD IS GREAT!!!\" ---Is not really news anymore because it happens somewhere in the world every day. And every question you would propose to discuss here can be fully covered in an examination of those events.",

        "reply": " Your original post and this answer WP are amateurish and patently false. \"The best way to lead someone to a desired conclusion is to make them think they came to it on their own.\" This is also the way are children are indoctrinated in public schools. You set the parameters, characterize the event and then ask the pointed question. The whole truth has little to do with anything. In this case the whole truth would have included the fact that this guy was mentally unbalanced and working alone. You set the reader up to make the conclusion that while not actually violent or dangerous themselves, religious fundamentalists, religious folks, or the christian religion in that geographic area create a situation or act as a catalyst for violence. The conclusion you wished to be drawn was that religion presents a danger to society. Congratualtions. Your on the verge of declaring a \"thought\" a menace to society. How enlightened of you. And how cowardly as well, for \"on the verge\" is where you and others like you will stay for now. News? \"God is great God is great God is great BOOOOM!!!! GOD IS GREAT!!! GOD IS GREAT!!!\" ---Is not really news anymore because it happens somewhere in the world every day. And every question you would propose to discuss here can be fully covered in an examination of those events.",
