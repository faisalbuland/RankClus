Yep,I remember when they set of a car bomb on Ramstien AFB back in the fall of 1985. It really sucked. It seemed you always had to watch your back when walking down the streets of W.Germany. Another guy around the same time near where I was stationed at got the crap beat out of him from a German who was dressed as a U.S. soldier. I think it was near Gelnhausen. Is this legal? I don't know,but its fun isn't?!",

Has anyone ever heard of a security reason behind the answer to this question (such as holding a certain level of clearance). There is personal/legal/sensitive information on any kind of legal ID and a whole lot of thieves around who would like to see it just to use it. If you don't have a legal reason, it's none of your business. Rubber-necking/gawking doesn't constitute a good reason - Wandering and Wondering",
