Obama landed at Baghdad International Airport and was meeting U.S. commanders and troops during his first visit to the country since taking office in January. Earlier, his spokesman said Obama would not be able to see Iraqi leaders in person because poor weather prevented helicopter travel in the capital. But the White House said later that Obama would meet with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki at the U.S. military base. Obama, speaking to reporters, said he came to Iraq for face-to-face meetings and to get a better sense of the security situation. \"We spent a lot of time trying to get Afghanistan right (but) there's still a lot of work to be done here.\" \"We've made significant progress here Obama said one major reason for his visit was to thank the troops. \"They are doing extraordinary work. General Odierno has been helping to lead a very effective operation here.\" He spoke with General Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, sitting at his side.

Obama landed at Baghdad International Airport and was meeting U.S. commanders and troops during his first visit to the country since taking office in January. Earlier, his spokesman said Obama would not be able to see Iraqi leaders in person because poor weather prevented helicopter travel in the capital. But the White House said later that Obama would meet with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki at the U.S. military base. Obama, speaking to reporters, said he came to Iraq for face-to-face meetings and to get a better sense of the security situation. \"We spent a lot of time trying to get Afghanistan right (but) there's still a lot of work to be done here.\" \"We've made significant progress here Obama said one major reason for his visit was to thank the troops. \"They are doing extraordinary work.
