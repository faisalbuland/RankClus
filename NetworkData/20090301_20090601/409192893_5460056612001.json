The salesman explained that the radio was voice activated. 'Nelson,' the salesman said to the radio The radio replied,'Ricky or Willie?' 'Willie!' he continued and 'On The Road Again'. came from the speakers. Then he said,'Ray Charles!', and in an instant ' Georgia On My Mind' replaced Willie Nelson. I drove away happy, and for the next few days, every timeI'd say,'Beethoven,' I'd get beautiful classical music, and if I said,'Beatles,' I'd get one of their awesome songs. Yesterday, some Mexicans ran a red light and nearly creamed my new truck, but I swerved in time to avoid them. I yelled,'Ass H@#$s!' Immediately the Iranian National Anthem began to play, sung by Jane Fonda and Barbara Streisand, backed up by Michael Moore and The Dixie Chicks, with John Kerry on guitar, Al Gore on drums, Dan Rather on harmonica, Nancy Pelosi on tambourine, Harry Reid on spoons, Bill Clinton on sax and Ted Kennedy On Scotch. Damn, I LOVE this truck! i couldn't resist..lol",
