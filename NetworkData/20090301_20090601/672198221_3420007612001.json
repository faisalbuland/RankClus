Tiversa employees found engineering and communications information about Marine One at an IP address in Tehran, Iran. \u201dWe found a file containing entire blueprints and avionics package for Marine One, which is the president's helicopter,\" said Bob Boback, CEO of Tiversa. The company told Target 11 that it was able to trace the file back to its original source. \"What appears to be a defense contractor in Bethesda, Md., had a file sharing program on one of their systems that also contained highly sensitive blueprints for Marine One,\" Boback said. Tiversa also found sensitive financial information about the cost of the helicopter on that same computer. Boback said someone from the company most likely downloaded a file-sharing program, typically used to exchange music, not realizing the potential problems. \"When downloading one of these file-sharing programs, you are effectively allowing others around the world to access your hard drive,\" Boback said. \"We found where this information came from,\" said Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, an adviser to Tiversa. \"We know exactly what computer it came from. I'm sure that person is embarrassed and may even lose their job, but we know where it came from and we know where it went.\" Boback notified the government immediately and said appropriate steps are being taken. \u201cThey are working through a process to maintain the security of the president,\u201d Boback said. Iran is not the only country that appears to be accessing this type of information through file-sharing programs. \u201cWe've noticed it out of Pakistan, Yemen, Qatar, and China. They are actively searching for information that is disclosed in this fashion because it is a great source of intelligence,\u201d Boback said. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

Even a seeder - the originator of a file has to actually commit that file for access. It don't just happen. Two thing to note. First an obvious 'skeer'about P2P which is in reality threatening to get too big to monitor effectively - it's a security 'breech' but not for Joe Public. The second is another obvious poke at the Iranians. They somehow are 'sucking the living goodness' out of unknowing defense contractors in America? Horse sh*t!
