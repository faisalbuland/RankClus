Legislature supports gay marriage challenge SACRAMENTO \u2014 Both houses of the state Legislature passed resolutions Monday endorsing the legal effort to overturn California's same-sex marriage ban, just days before the issue goes to the state Supreme Court. The resolutions passed along party lines, 18-14 in the Senate and 45-27 in the Assembly, with several members absent in both chambers. Supporters of the resolutions said Proposition 8 should not have been placed on the November ballot through the initiative process. They said it represented a revision to the state Constitution because it stripped away existing rights and argue that only the Legislature can place such revisions before voters. \"We're talking about a radical revision to our Constitution,\" said Sen. Mark Leno, the San Francisco Democrat who sponsored the Senate resolution. \"Do we have a constitutional democracy in California or do we have mob rule, where a majority of Californians can change the Constitution at any time?\" He equated it to the fight for racial equality decades ago. He noted that in 1964, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure that would have allowed landlords to discriminate against renters based on race. Proposition 8 passed with 52 percent of the vote. By amending the state Constitution, it overturned a California Supreme Court decision last year that legalized same-sex marriage. It was the second time California voters have said marriage should be between a man and a woman. Between the Supreme Court's decision last spring and the November election, about 18,000 gay couples married.

        "content": "I believe that this is an argument that has been overlooked: Originallyposted: 11DEC08 I have repeatedly read and heard the phrase \"... the sanctity of marriage ...\". In the Oxford Concise Dictionary, the word \"sanctity\" is defined as: sanctity \u2022 noun (pl. sanctities) 1 holiness; saintliness. These indicate that, while borrowed for other usages, the word is essentially a religious one . . . as is \"marriage\" in the minds of most opponents of same-sex \"marriage\". I am reminded that the Constitution of the United States of America gives: \"...Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\". The laws of our land are somewhat schizophrenic, in that they do not always keep pace with logic and clarity. Many humorous and not-so-humorous examples can come to mind. In this instance, it seems necessary to consider that \"marriage\", where it is understood as an extension of ones' personal religious views is logically protected by a Constitutionally-mandated blindness on the part of the U.S. Government. Not all religions, not even all sects of Christianity, view marriage as a sacrament or sacred activity. I find a way out of the present tangle of religion and government by looking at the solution presented by New Zealand. In New Zealand, \"marriage\", like a bris, baptism or whatever religious ritual, does NOT of necessity exist in governmental law or parlance. Instead, they mandated a grandfathering of all marriages prior to their legislation into \"Civil Partnerships\" as far as the law was concerned. They systematically went through all their old marriage laws and merely substituted the words \"Civil Partnership\" wherever and whenever the word \"marriage\" occurred, then expanded the requiremnts to allow for said Civil Partnerships to include same-sex relationships. In New Zealand thought, if any legal Civil Partners wish to have a \"marriage\" ceremony, it is the purview of their private religious group to oversee such a private religious activity. . . and is in no way the place of the Government to pay it any attention whatsoever. I think that we could take a page from the Kiwis on this matter.",
