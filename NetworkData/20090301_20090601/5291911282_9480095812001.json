The phone will soon ring and the guilty child had better answer and explain. Now don't get me wrong everyone. I DON'T just hang out on the internet hoping my kids will screw up. I don't even log in daily anymore. They now know the dangers out there and I feel better knowing that they know I have the capability to check in on their activities. Bottom line is, I firmly believe EVERY parent should have at a minimum a keystroke logger type program loaded on their childrens' computer. Preditors are everywhere and parents need to keep a watchfull eye on their kids internet activities as they would if they were simply walking around the mall.
