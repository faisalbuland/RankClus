Keep pushing those moderates out Rush...we'll take 'em all. Colin Powell/Rush Limbaugh War Rages On In the circular firing squad known as the Republican party, the two-man skirmish between former Secretary of State Colin Powell and GOP strategist Rush Limbaugh shows no signs of abating any time soon. Their rhetorical battle intensified yesterday, when an incensed Limbaugh told Powell he should just make it official, join \"Benedict Arlen\" and switch over to the Democratic Party: \"What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party.\" Further taunting Powell, Limbaugh reiterated his claim that the only reason Powell voted for Obama over McCain is the president's race: \"He's just mad at me because I'm the one person in the country who had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama. It was purely and solely based on race.\" Really? The only person? Apparently Rush doesn't visit the comment section of right-leaning blogs very much. But how insulting is that remark? To claim that one of our most decorated war heroes, a shrewd tactical general possessing a stellar intellect and a deep love for his country, is nothing more than a single-issue voter, and that the issue in question has racist implications. . . What has Rush in such a tizzy? Well, he was reacting to remarks Powell made in a speech on Monday, in which, once again, he diagnosed one of the GOP's most-glaring problems: \"I think what Rush does as an entertainer diminishes the party and intrudes or inserts into our public life a kind of nastiness that we would be better to do without.\" In other words, Republicans need a new party leader. \"http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/05/07/colin-powell-rush-limbaugh-war-rages-on/\"",

Their rhetorical battle intensified yesterday, when an incensed Limbaugh told Powell he should just make it official, join \"Benedict Arlen\" and switch over to the Democratic Party: \"What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party.\" Further taunting Powell, Limbaugh reiterated his claim that the only reason Powell voted for Obama over McCain is the president's race: \"He's just mad at me because I'm the one person in the country who had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama. It was purely and solely based on race.\" Really? The only person? Apparently Rush doesn't visit the comment section of right-leaning blogs very much. But how insulting is that remark? To claim that one of our most decorated war heroes, a shrewd tactical general possessing a stellar intellect and a deep love for his country, is nothing more than a single-issue voter, and that the issue in question has racist implications. . . What has Rush in such a tizzy? Well, he was reacting to remarks Powell made in a speech on Monday, in which, once again, he diagnosed one of the GOP's most-glaring problems: \"I think what Rush does as an entertainer diminishes the party and intrudes or inserts into our public life a kind of nastiness that we would be better to do without.\" In other words, Republicans need a new party leader. \"http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/05/07/colin-powell-rush-limbaugh-war-rages-on/\" Here's a thought SW: Prior to last November I was more or less benignly indifferent to gay marriage.

Since that time, however, the vileness of the attacks by pro-gay groups has clearly demonstrated to me that while my basic belief has not changed I will never under any circumstance allow myself to be identified as being favorable toward gay marriage. The attacks have been based on a level of hate that is difficult to imagine and one that I cannot allow myself to be affiliated with.

The team's very good and has won numerous matches, do you leave or stay with the winning team? Let's say you're a great bowler and help the team team win lots of matches.

Powell's a good bowler but he doesn't think like the other members of his team. So does the republican team keep him because he's good and can help them win a game or two, or does he really think like the rest of the team? Personally I think all the moderates need to go, MexiCain, Powell, Snowe and many others. Rush is a blowhard but he's right sometimes. A new conservative party needs to arise from the ashes that is the republican party. A party that understands that three things define a Nation: Borders language Culture Democrats and moderates don't want to defend our borders, they're internationalist. Democrats and moderates don't want English as an official language because to do that is racist. Democrats and moderates tolerate the \"anything goes\" mentality of multiculturalism. They refuse to understand that in a melting pot may things go into it but only one finished product gets pored out of it. In the long run conservatives will be better off without Powell and others like him.",

Powell's a good bowler but he doesn't think like the other members of his team. So does the republican team keep him because he's good and can help them win a game or two, or does he really think like the rest of the team? Personally I think all the moderates need to go, MexiCain, Powell, Snowe and many others. Rush is a blowhard but he's right sometimes. A new conservative party needs to arise from the ashes that is the republican party. A party that understands that three things define a Nation: Borders language Culture Democrats and moderates don't want to defend our borders, they're internationalist. Democrats and moderates don't want English as an official language because to do that is racist. Democrats and moderates tolerate the \"anything goes\" mentality of multiculturalism. They refuse to understand that in a melting pot may things go into it but only one finished product gets pored out of it. In the long run conservatives will be better off without Powell and others like him.",

Colin Powell/Rush Limbaugh War Rages On In the circular firing squad known as the Republican party, the two-man skirmish between former Secretary of State Colin Powell and GOP strategist Rush Limbaugh shows no signs of abating any time soon. Their rhetorical battle intensified yesterday, when an incensed Limbaugh told Powell he should just make it official, join \"Benedict Arlen\" and switch over to the Democratic Party: \"What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party.\" Further taunting Powell, Limbaugh reiterated his claim that the only reason Powell voted for Obama over McCain is the president's race: \"He's just mad at me because I'm the one person in the country who had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama. It was purely and solely based on race.\" Really? The only person? Apparently Rush doesn't visit the comment section of right-leaning blogs very much. But how insulting is that remark?

Colin Powell/Rush Limbaugh War Rages On In the circular firing squad known as the Republican party, the two-man skirmish between former Secretary of State Colin Powell and GOP strategist Rush Limbaugh shows no signs of abating any time soon. Their rhetorical battle intensified yesterday, when an incensed Limbaugh told Powell he should just make it official, join \"Benedict Arlen\" and switch over to the Democratic Party: \"What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party.\" Further taunting Powell, Limbaugh reiterated his claim that the only reason Powell voted for Obama over McCain is the president's race: \"He's just mad at me because I'm the one person in the country who had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama. It was purely and solely based on race.\" Really? The only person? Apparently Rush doesn't visit the comment section of right-leaning blogs very much. But how insulting is that remark? To claim that one of our most decorated war heroes, a shrewd tactical general possessing a stellar intellect and a deep love for his country, is nothing more than a single-issue voter, and that the issue in question has racist implications. . . What has Rush in such a tizzy? Well, he was reacting to remarks Powell made in a speech on Monday, in which, once again, he diagnosed one of the GOP's most-glaring problems: \"I think what Rush does as an entertainer diminishes the party and intrudes or inserts into our public life a kind of nastiness that we would be better to do without.\" In other words, Republicans need a new party leader. \"http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/05/07/colin-powell-rush-limbaugh-war-rages-on/\" Here's a thought SW: Prior to last November I was more or less benignly indifferent to gay marriage. Marry, don't marry, it made no difference to me and when the time came I gladly voted against what I considered to be a bad law here in FL. Since that time, however, the vileness of the attacks by pro-gay groups has clearly demonstrated to me that while my basic belief has not changed I will never under any circumstance allow myself to be identified as being favorable toward gay marriage. The attacks have been based on a level of hate that is difficult to imagine and one that I cannot allow myself to be affiliated with. I have little doubt that in the near future gay marriage will be more or less part of the fabric of society but sadly the status of the gay community may well have been irreparably damaged in the process. The behavior of gay leaders such as Perez Hilton has left an indelible blemish, one that will not be fading away any time soon. another one states the change in thoughts toward gay rights, same as so many others who were 'once' indifferent to their cause.

It was purely and solely based on race.\" Really? The only person? Apparently Rush doesn't visit the comment section of right-leaning blogs very much. But how insulting is that remark? To claim that one of our most decorated war heroes, a shrewd tactical general possessing a stellar intellect and a deep love for his country, is nothing more than a single-issue voter, and that the issue in question has racist implications. . .

Since that time, however, the vileness of the attacks by pro-gay groups has clearly demonstrated to me that while my basic belief has not changed I will never under any circumstance allow myself to be identified as being favorable toward gay marriage. The attacks have been based on a level of hate that is difficult to imagine and one that I cannot allow myself to be affiliated with. I have little doubt that in the near future gay marriage will be more or less part of the fabric of society but sadly the status of the gay community may well have been irreparably damaged in the process.

Their rhetorical battle intensified yesterday, when an incensed Limbaugh told Powell he should just make it official, join \"Benedict Arlen\" and switch over to the Democratic Party: \"What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party.\" Further taunting Powell, Limbaugh reiterated his claim that the only reason Powell voted for Obama over McCain is the president's race: \"He's just mad at me because I'm the one person in the country who had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama. It was purely and solely based on race.\" Really? The only person? Apparently Rush doesn't visit the comment section of right-leaning blogs very much. But how insulting is that remark? To claim that one of our most decorated war heroes, a shrewd tactical general possessing a stellar intellect and a deep love for his country, is nothing more than a single-issue voter, and that the issue in question has racist implications. . .

Since that time, however, the vileness of the attacks by pro-gay groups has clearly demonstrated to me that while my basic belief has not changed I will never under any circumstance allow myself to be identified as being favorable toward gay marriage. The attacks have been based on a level of hate that is difficult to imagine and one that I cannot allow myself to be affiliated with. I have little doubt that in the near future gay marriage will be more or less part of the fabric of society but sadly the status of the gay community may well have been irreparably damaged in the process.

Colin Powell/Rush Limbaugh War Rages On In the circular firing squad known as the Republican party, the two-man skirmish between former Secretary of State Colin Powell and GOP strategist Rush Limbaugh shows no signs of abating any time soon. Their rhetorical battle intensified yesterday, when an incensed Limbaugh told Powell he should just make it official, join \"Benedict Arlen\" and switch over to the Democratic Party: \"What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party.\" Further taunting Powell, Limbaugh reiterated his claim that the only reason Powell voted for Obama over McCain is the president's race: \"He's just mad at me because I'm the one person in the country who had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama. It was purely and solely based on race.\" Really? The only person? Apparently Rush doesn't visit the comment section of right-leaning blogs very much. But how insulting is that remark? To claim that one of our most decorated war heroes, a shrewd tactical general possessing a stellar intellect and a deep love for his country, is nothing more than a single-issue voter, and that the issue in question has racist implications. . . What has Rush in such a tizzy? Well, he was reacting to remarks Powell made in a speech on Monday, in which, once again, he diagnosed one of the GOP's most-glaring problems: \"I think what Rush does as an entertainer diminishes the party and intrudes or inserts into our public life a kind of nastiness that we would be better to do without.\" In other words, Republicans need a new party leader. \"http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/05/07/colin-powell-rush-limbaugh-war-rages-on/\" Here's a thought SW: Prior to last November I was more or less benignly indifferent to gay marriage. Marry, don't marry, it made no difference to me and when the time came I gladly voted against what I considered to be a bad law here in FL. Since that time, however, the vileness of the attacks by pro-gay groups has clearly demonstrated to me that while my basic belief has not changed I will never under any circumstance allow myself to be identified as being favorable toward gay marriage. The attacks have been based on a level of hate that is difficult to imagine and one that I cannot allow myself to be affiliated with. I have little doubt that in the near future gay marriage will be more or less part of the fabric of society but sadly the status of the gay community may well have been irreparably damaged in the process. The behavior of gay leaders such as Perez Hilton has left an indelible blemish, one that will not be fading away any time soon. another one states the change in thoughts toward gay rights, same as so many others who were 'once' indifferent to their cause.
