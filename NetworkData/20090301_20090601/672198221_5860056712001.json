He said the current \u201ccrisis\u201d facing all the services\u2019 procurement and force structure plans, where \u201cwe are killing force structure to try to buy new weapons,\u201d is a failure of leadership, not of process. \u201cWe talk of \u201cjointness,\u201d but the reality is that each service is involved in an existential battle for resources against the others. We have gone into two wars with no clear plan for conflict termination or for stability operations. We have tried to manage wars through supplementals in the absence of long-term plans, decoupled military operations from nation building, and been so slow to react to the growth of the threat in Afghanistan that we are now losing a war we once thought we had decisively won.\u201d \u201cSome of this can be blamed on what may have been the worst national security team of the postwar era. As someone who thought Robert McNamara represented the nadir in defense leadership, I have to give Donald Rumsfeld credit for being the epitome of a micromanaging bully who scattered snowflakes like dandruff, and with about as much effect. I also have a horrifying sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when I compare McGeorge Bundy and the Rostows to Cheney and our recent national security advisers. There is far too little difference between the \u201cneoconservatives\u201d of Iraq and Afghanistan and the \u201cneoliberals\u201d of Vietnam.\u201d \u201cYear after year, our top civilian and military decision makers came and went letting the under-budgeting of procurement, force plans, and manpower grow. We then found ourselves fighting \u201clong\u201d wars that we took years to fully deploy and budget for, each year asking for supplementals that tacitly assumed we would win in the next year. We were slow to react in Iraq, and took until FY2007 to seriously budget for Afghanistan. In fact, we used the totally predictable inability to precisely predict the cost of war to create a nightmare of unrealistic annual baseline budgets, half thought-out supplementals, and pointless Future Year Defense Plans (FYDPs).\u201d Cordesman said the last thing DOD needs is another commission or study to examine the defense \u201cprocess.\u201d Rather, what is needed are leaders willing to make tough choices, that means cutting cherished weapons programs, and who are held accountable for their decisions. \u201cThere is only one test: what did you do that served the broader national interest of the U.S. successfully during your tour of duty. Not your party, not your ideology, not your service, and not your program.\u201d The crisis befalling DOD is also the product of a complete decoupling of any meaningful strategy and detailed force and procurement plans and honest budgeting. Cordesman had some choice comments on the upcoming QDR, being run on the OSD side by under secretary of defense Michele Flournoy\u2019s policy shop. \u201cIf God really hates you, you may end up working on a Quadrennial Defense Review: The most pointless and destructive planning effort imaginable. You will waste two years on a document decoupled from a real world force plan, from an honest set of decisions about manpower or procurement, with no clear budget or FYDP, and with no metrics to measure or determine its success. If God merely dislikes you, you may end up helping your service chief or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs draft one of those vague, anodyne strategy documents that is all concepts and no plans or execution. If God is totally indifferent, you will end up working on our national strategy and simply be irrelevant.\u201d \u201cIs $533.7 billion in FY2010 and 4.2% of the GNP enough? Enough for what? Our most recent QDR is a morass of half thought-out ideas\u2014many calling for further study or otherwise deferring tangible action. We don\u2019t have a force plan. We don\u2019t have a clearly defined procurement plan. We don\u2019t tie it to end strength goals that are clearly defined and costed. We haven\u2019t provided meaningful budget figures because the FYDP is not tied to the QDR. We haven\u2019t set clear goals to be achieved. We have no metrics.\u201d \u201cWould we be where we are today if we forced the department to tie its strategy to plans and budget, if we demanded metrics, if we required a public annual accounting, and if we held our top leadership fully accountable? Can any change in process or business practices make up for this failure? The answer is no.\u201d This message has been edited.

The chroniesm, waste, fraud and abuse is insane! The competition between branches to land their pet projects (and thereby land a cushie job upon retirement) is a frill the American people can no longer afford. IMHO we need several new mindsets, like: 1. If we need it, buy it. If we just want it, people in hell want icewater too. 2. No more going to war without a plan. If we have to respond to an emergency fine. But no protracted wars without a plan to win. If you don't plan to win...you're planning to lose. 3. If you are involved in procurement, retire and go to work with one of your former vendors, you go to jail. This hasn't got sheit to do with Bush, Obama, the republican party, or the democratic party. This is about waste and greed.",

American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.
