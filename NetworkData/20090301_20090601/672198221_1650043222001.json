But I also think your opinion matters as well because it is right as well. Although, yes they could be found and stayed \"guilty as charged\", the TOP Officials that directed and implemented this leadership needs to be brought fourth as well. That is and has been my MAIN point on this entire issue. The Right Loons, defend and defended their fearless leader lock stock and barrel, even while these young heroes were being punished FOR DOING WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THEIR DUTY and NOT 1 of them, even the ones that post on this board defended the REAL victims and the REAL heroes in this entire ordeal. Others: I have been around the military 20 years and I know, the right way, the wrong way and the military way, I know how bad leadership can inflict a soured culture to any command. They deserve this appeal even if ultimately it is denied, this will bring it ALL out and at least nothing else, their names will be vindicated. Mod dup. delete if you like",

That would fall into the responsibility of their command and their own personal responsibilities. That said. Considering circumstances, training, and location, I am of a more forgiving nature. Those that assuredly knew better should have a price to pay. Just not yet. Not to us. They may have been doing what they thought we all expected them to do.",
