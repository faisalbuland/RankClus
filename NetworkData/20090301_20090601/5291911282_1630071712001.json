Bradford Wilcox March 03, 2009 'While many social conservatives have focused attention on Obama\u2019s liberal social commitments, few have considered what effects an expanded welfare state will have on religious belief\u2014or how these religious effects will in turn impact civic virtue, personal responsibility, altruism, or solidarity. If the European experience with the welfare state and religion is any indication, the Obama revolution could well lead the United States down the secular path already trod by Europe. Why is this significant for the vitality of religion in America? A recent study of 33 countries around the world by Anthony Gill and Erik Lundsgaarde, political scientists at the University of Washington, indicates that there is an inverse relationship between state welfare spending and religiosity. Specifically, they found that countries with larger welfare states had markedly lower levels of religious attendance, had higher rates of citizens indicating no religious affiliation whatsoever, and their people took less comfort in religion in general. In their words, \u201cCountries with higher levels of per capita welfare have a proclivity for less religious participation and tend to have higher percentages of non-religious individuals.\u201d Gill and Lundsgaarde show, for instance, that Scandinavian societies such as Sweden and Denmark have some of the largest welfare states in the world as well as some of the lowest levels of religious attendance in the world. By contrast, countries with a history of limited government\u2014from the United States to the Philippines\u2014have markedly higher levels of religiosity. The link between religion and the welfare state remains robust even after Gill and Lundsgaarde control for socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, region, and literacy. The bottom line: as government grows, people\u2019s reliance on God seems to diminish. How do we account for the inverse relationship between government size and religious vitality? As Gill and Lundsgaarde point out, some individuals have strong spiritual needs that can only be met by religion. This portion of the population remains faithful, come what may. But other individuals only turn to churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques when their needs for social or material security are not being met by the market or state. In an environment characterized by ordinary levels of social or economic insecurity, many of these individuals will turn to local congregations for social, economic, and emotional support. At times of high insecurity, such as the current recession, religious demand goes even higher. Witness, for instance, press accounts chronicling the recent boom in churchgoing among Americans hit hard by the recession. Of course, many of those who initially turn to the church around the corner for instrumental reasons often end up developing an intrinsic appreciation for the spiritual and moral goods found in their local congregation. By contrast, the more the state steps in to reduce the economic and social insecurity of its citizens, the less likely fair-weather believers are to darken the door of a church on Sunday. Now, to paraphrase Charles Krauthammer, Obama hopes to expand the size of the welfare state by offering cradle-to-grave health care and cradle-to-cubicle education to Americans. If he gets his way, Americans will not have to trust in God, or their fellow congregants, to support an ailing parent, or to help them figure out how to pay for their daughter\u2019s college tuition. Instead, they can put their faith in Uncle Sam. To secularists and religious skeptics, this may seem no great loss. Who cares if Americans substitute \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d for \u201cIn Government We Trust\u201d? But as political scientist Alan Wolfe observed in Whose Keeper?, one of the primary dangers associated with the rise of the nanny state is that \u201cwhen government assumes moral responsibility for others, people are less likely to do so themselves.\u201d Wolfe noted that large increases in welfare spending in Sweden, Denmark and Norway over the last half century have ended up eroding the moral fabric of families and civic institutions in these societies. Scandinavians have come to depend not on family, civil society, or themselves, but on the government for their basic needs. ------ to the economic and social challenges that now beset us, over the long term the Obama revolution is likely to erode first the religious and then the civic and moral fabric of the nation. Undoubtedly, this is not the change religious believers who put their faith in Obama last November are hoping for from this president. But if the European experiment with the welfare state tells us anything, it tells us that this is the change we can expect from a successful Obama revolution. \" . I lived in England and I had a son who was a missionary in england and discovered that the more the people depend on the government for sustinance..the more they turn away from God and england is about now..a GODLESS COUNTRY..Im hoping that discovering this..that the swing back will be in the other direction...so..IS THIS WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY..FOUNDED UNDER RELIGIOUS PRINCIPALS..SOUND OFF ON THIS ISSUE..

Bradford Wilcox March 03, 2009 'While many social conservatives have focused attention on Obama\u2019s liberal social commitments, few have considered what effects an expanded welfare state will have on religious belief\u2014or how these religious effects will in turn impact civic virtue, personal responsibility, altruism, or solidarity. If the European experience with the welfare state and religion is any indication, the Obama revolution could well lead the United States down the secular path already trod by Europe. Why is this significant for the vitality of religion in America? A recent study of 33 countries around the world by Anthony Gill and Erik Lundsgaarde, political scientists at the University of Washington, indicates that there is an inverse relationship between state welfare spending and religiosity. Specifically, they found that countries with larger welfare states had markedly lower levels of religious attendance, had higher rates of citizens indicating no religious affiliation whatsoever, and their people took less comfort in religion in general. In their words, \u201cCountries with higher levels of per capita welfare have a proclivity for less religious participation and tend to have higher percentages of non-religious individuals.\u201d Gill and Lundsgaarde show, for instance, that Scandinavian societies such as Sweden and Denmark have some of the largest welfare states in the world as well as some of the lowest levels of religious attendance in the world. By contrast, countries with a history of limited government\u2014from the United States to the Philippines\u2014have markedly higher levels of religiosity. The link between religion and the welfare state remains robust even after Gill and Lundsgaarde control for socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, region, and literacy. The bottom line: as government grows, people\u2019s reliance on God seems to diminish. How do we account for the inverse relationship between government size and religious vitality? As Gill and Lundsgaarde point out, some individuals have strong spiritual needs that can only be met by religion. This portion of the population remains faithful, come what may. But other individuals only turn to churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques when their needs for social or material security are not being met by the market or state. In an environment characterized by ordinary levels of social or economic insecurity, many of these individuals will turn to local congregations for social, economic, and emotional support. At times of high insecurity, such as the current recession, religious demand goes even higher. Witness, for instance, press accounts chronicling the recent boom in churchgoing among Americans hit hard by the recession. Of course, many of those who initially turn to the church around the corner for instrumental reasons often end up developing an intrinsic appreciation for the spiritual and moral goods found in their local congregation. By contrast, the more the state steps in to reduce the economic and social insecurity of its citizens, the less likely fair-weather believers are to darken the door of a church on Sunday. Now, to paraphrase Charles Krauthammer, Obama hopes to expand the size of the welfare state by offering cradle-to-grave health care and cradle-to-cubicle education to Americans. If he gets his way, Americans will not have to trust in God, or their fellow congregants, to support an ailing parent, or to help them figure out how to pay for their daughter\u2019s college tuition. Instead, they can put their faith in Uncle Sam. To secularists and religious skeptics, this may seem no great loss. Who cares if Americans substitute \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d for \u201cIn Government We Trust\u201d? But as political scientist Alan Wolfe observed in Whose Keeper?, one of the primary dangers associated with the rise of the nanny state is that \u201cwhen government assumes moral responsibility for others, people are less likely to do so themselves.\u201d Wolfe noted that large increases in welfare spending in Sweden, Denmark and Norway over the last half century have ended up eroding the moral fabric of families and civic institutions in these societies. Scandinavians have come to depend not on family, civil society, or themselves, but on the government for their basic needs. ------ to the economic and social challenges that now beset us, over the long term the Obama revolution is likely to erode first the religious and then the civic and moral fabric of the nation. Undoubtedly, this is not the change religious believers who put their faith in Obama last November are hoping for from this president. But if the European experiment with the welfare state tells us anything, it tells us that this is the change we can expect from a successful Obama revolution. \" . I lived in England and I had a son who was a missionary in england and discovered that the more the people depend on the government for sustinance..the more they turn away from God and england is about now..a GODLESS COUNTRY..Im hoping that discovering this..that the swing back will be in the other direction...so..IS THIS WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY..FOUNDED UNDER RELIGIOUS PRINCIPALS..SOUND OFF ON THIS ISSUE..

Bradford Wilcox March 03, 2009 'While many social conservatives have focused attention on Obama\u2019s liberal social commitments, few have considered what effects an expanded welfare state will have on religious belief\u2014or how these religious effects will in turn impact civic virtue, personal responsibility, altruism, or solidarity. If the European experience with the welfare state and religion is any indication, the Obama revolution could well lead the United States down the secular path already trod by Europe. Why is this significant for the vitality of religion in America? A recent study of 33 countries around the world by Anthony Gill and Erik Lundsgaarde, political scientists at the University of Washington, indicates that there is an inverse relationship between state welfare spending and religiosity. Specifically, they found that countries with larger welfare states had markedly lower levels of religious attendance, had higher rates of citizens indicating no religious affiliation whatsoever, and their people took less comfort in religion in general. In their words, \u201cCountries with higher levels of per capita welfare have a proclivity for less religious participation and tend to have higher percentages of non-religious individuals.\u201d Gill and Lundsgaarde show, for instance, that Scandinavian societies such as Sweden and Denmark have some of the largest welfare states in the world as well as some of the lowest levels of religious attendance in the world. By contrast, countries with a history of limited government\u2014from the United States to the Philippines\u2014have markedly higher levels of religiosity. The link between religion and the welfare state remains robust even after Gill and Lundsgaarde control for socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, region, and literacy. The bottom line: as government grows, people\u2019s reliance on God seems to diminish. How do we account for the inverse relationship between government size and religious vitality? As Gill and Lundsgaarde point out, some individuals have strong spiritual needs that can only be met by religion. This portion of the population remains faithful, come what may. But other individuals only turn to churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques when their needs for social or material security are not being met by the market or state. In an environment characterized by ordinary levels of social or economic insecurity, many of these individuals will turn to local congregations for social, economic, and emotional support. At times of high insecurity, such as the current recession, religious demand goes even higher. Witness, for instance, press accounts chronicling the recent boom in churchgoing among Americans hit hard by the recession. Of course, many of those who initially turn to the church around the corner for instrumental reasons often end up developing an intrinsic appreciation for the spiritual and moral goods found in their local congregation. By contrast, the more the state steps in to reduce the economic and social insecurity of its citizens, the less likely fair-weather believers are to darken the door of a church on Sunday. Now, to paraphrase Charles Krauthammer, Obama hopes to expand the size of the welfare state by offering cradle-to-grave health care and cradle-to-cubicle education to Americans. If he gets his way, Americans will not have to trust in God, or their fellow congregants, to support an ailing parent, or to help them figure out how to pay for their daughter\u2019s college tuition. Instead, they can put their faith in Uncle Sam. To secularists and religious skeptics, this may seem no great loss. Who cares if Americans substitute \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d for \u201cIn Government We Trust\u201d? But as political scientist Alan Wolfe observed in Whose Keeper?, one of the primary dangers associated with the rise of the nanny state is that \u201cwhen government assumes moral responsibility for others, people are less likely to do so themselves.\u201d Wolfe noted that large increases in welfare spending in Sweden, Denmark and Norway over the last half century have ended up eroding the moral fabric of families and civic institutions in these societies. Scandinavians have come to depend not on family, civil society, or themselves, but on the government for their basic needs. ------ to the economic and social challenges that now beset us, over the long term the Obama revolution is likely to erode first the religious and then the civic and moral fabric of the nation. Undoubtedly, this is not the change religious believers who put their faith in Obama last November are hoping for from this president. But if the European experiment with the welfare state tells us anything, it tells us that this is the change we can expect from a successful Obama revolution. \" . I lived in England and I had a son who was a missionary in england and discovered that the more the people depend on the government for sustinance..the more they turn away from God and england is about now..a GODLESS COUNTRY..Im hoping that discovering this..that the swing back will be in the other direction...so..IS THIS WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY..FOUNDED UNDER RELIGIOUS PRINCIPALS..SOUND OFF ON THIS ISSUE..

If a person's faith cannot withstand a social safety net provided by the government, I'm glad that they don't have to face actual persecution for their beliefs. Jesus refused to be baited into taking sides on the perennial question of the legitimacy of government in religious affairs, or the legitimacy of government in general. Rome ran the world in those days, and though they guaranteed a certain level of religious tolerance to the Jews, they also set up a rather questionable half-Jewish semi-monarch. Herod's claim to the Davidic line was almost baseless, and his loyalty to the Jewish elders was shaky. Some, the zealots included, advocating overthrowing this illegitimate government by force. Others, including many of the same Jewish elders advocated being co-opted or buying into the Roman system, and thus gaining temporal power. So Jesus' questioner wanted him to take sides on this debate. Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and give to God what is God's. You can argue any form of government from moral, ethical, and logical grounds. You can even advocate overthrowing particularly heinous or unjust ones. But God exists quite independently of any earthly power. So pay your dues to whatever earthly power defends your borders and issues your local currency. And pay your dues to God. No need getting the two all mixed up together, by arguing that God is for your particular favored form of government. I would argue that democracy best reflects the free choice which God granted us as human beings. But a person can be faithful under and circumstances.",
