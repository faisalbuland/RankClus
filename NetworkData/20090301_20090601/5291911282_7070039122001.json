(May 13-17, 2009) It's a unique opportunity to not only give your appreciation to those who defend this country, but watch some powerful films that DON\"T portray our service men and women as thugs, drugies, or some type of reckless vigilantes like mainstream Hollywood likes to think is real. See for yourself on their web-site giff.com Senators and Big Stars every year, military families and friends, great films, and good night at the movies. If you can't attend you can even sponsor a soldier for the weekend. I'd also love to invite everyone to the premiere of SEAL Team VI. It's dedicated to the SEAL Teams, the entire SF Community, and anyone who's ever worn the American uniform to defend this great country. At the West Coast Premiere 100 people were turned away at the door and with the SEAL's getting the job done off the coast of Somalia a few weeks ago, I suspect it will be the same in DC. Watch the trailers of the documentaries as well on the GIFF site...American's need to see these films and you can help.",
