Thanks Hello --- May I suggest that you scroll down to the Marine Corps Discussion section of these boards and look for either the \"Wannabe section\" or the \"Marine Open forum\" and post your question there. You will get more replies. The program was for years called \"Devil-Pups\"...unless some \"kinder-gentler\" types have changed the name of the program. It is/was kinda-sorta like a cub-scout/boy-scout group but the kids get a red and yellow tee-shirt to wear and do calesthetics and some marching and other stuff. btw- Devil-Pups comes from the derisive term \"Devil-Dogs\"... a term used by the German soldiers of World War 1 about the fighting ability of the U.S. Marines they encountered. The german was \"tuffel-hunden\". The USMC took the term and changed it into english and for quite awhile now have used the picture of a bulldog with teeth as a poster and/or tee-shirt.",
