Wagoner says restructuring out of court would accomplish 99 percent of what could be achieved in bankruptcy. But he says it wouldn't have the risk of scaring away customers or the huge expense of Chapter 11. Wagoner made the statements Tuesday at a breakfast in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. General Motors Corp. has received $13.4 billion in federal loans and is seeking another $16.6 billion. The company faces a March 31 deadline to finish its viability plan and show the government it's worthy of the money. -http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/090317/gm_wagoner.html",
