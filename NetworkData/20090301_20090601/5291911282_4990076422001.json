They headed to San Deigo, California where he and his daughter went through a mini boot camp with the Marines. It was great fun to watch and they really did get a new appreciation for what one does to prepare for service.. ..the daughter Sofie really did well and Gene, well, let's just say Gene was a proud father...lol ...next they headed to the Veterans Hospital in Long Beach, California where they took the time to say hello, thank you and listen to the stories from our soldiers... ...during this hospital visit Gene Simmons was choked up, moved to tears and could hardly get the words \"thank you\" out, it was so moving I was starting to sob... ...Gene knew after that experience he could not stop there, he went on to get several companies to participate and donate enough money to get a state of the art medic van with all the top of the line equiptment needed to care for the men and women of our military... ...Gene and his band members went back to San Diego, California and put on a free concert for our men and women, it was great! ...the band did each song, from each branch of our military and everyone had a fun time singing along. It was wonderful to see the men and women being honored... ...from that moment, I knew, I would always be a new found fan of Gene Simmons. He took time to give back to our men and women, he went on record as saying how important their role was, how lucky we are for what they do and how every student should have to look into the eyes of our military to know just what they give for us. Outstanding!!! At the end of the show, Gene said, he had been drafted for the Vietnam war, his number was too high and he was passed on. He said, if called on, he would have gone to fight for America. America is that important to him that he would fight for her. Anyway, I am now a huge fan and just wanted to share the story with all of you.",

I turned 18 in 1971, after i completed high school. It took me 7 months after graduation to join the U.S. Army. My reasons to do so were three-fold - 1.)

I was also very timid at that time, basically scared of my own shadow. (A very long story about how that happened and how I'm still trying to get beyond those incidents.) 3.) I felt a need to serve my country. I was made to feel, by our society in general, that I was a 'coward' if I didn't. I didn't raise my hand to go to Vietnam, though I could have.

During that time I applied, and was accepted for an AGR tour. I find that as an AGR, I would not be the first choice for deployment, even if I were allowed to volunteer for deployment.

It was wonderful to see the men and women being honored... ...from that moment, I knew, I would always be a new found fan of Gene Simmons.

I was leveed for Viet Nam but was diverted to Germany by Nixon and spent 2 years on the Iorn Curtain instead Ergo, out of over 30 years of military service, in various positions, I have not been in combat. I am NOT alone in this position. Many of us still have no unit patch with which to grace our right sleeve. Went active Air Force for Desert Storm for three years but was not deployed out of the States. I retire after 22 years of Military without distinction, and 3 months later, 3 planes hit three buildings. I offered to rejoin my unit, which was finally activated, but there were no slots. I considered joining another unit, but had a heart attack the next spring. The Nation Defense (Road Guard) Ribbon is my only medal of any value By your position, I wonder if you consider those like me to be less Patriotic. I have made myself available for Uncle to do with as he pleased, for over thirty years, yet when I read comments like yours and kit's, I feel like many of my military brothers/sisters consider me to be merely a desk pogue (sp) or drone that is good for nothing except to keep the \"hereos\" and \"true Patriots\" in adequate supply of goods and services that they require. Did you put on the Uniform? Did you roll the dice and shoulder the Weapon? Would you have toed the line if Fate called your number?? Then what's your point? Your response is totally non-sequiter...comparing Macintosh Apples with Horse Apples. Even the most lowly recruit military wannabee who joined the National Guard and washed out in Basic Training will get more respect from me than all these wealthy glad-handers, who want to press flesh with the troops while in front of the cameras and get awarded the traditional unit jacket. Even if they do throw a few of their multi-millions into this or that, they immediately turn around and write it off their taxes . . so it becomes no donation at all - but nobody ever mentions that - EVER! It's all publicity, eye-wash, and maybe a little well-deserved guilt.

Is it your opinion that only those that have volunteered to be in direct line of fire are worthy of our respect? I turned 18 in 1971, after i completed high school. I joined under similar circumstances in 1970, Army/Armor - 3 years It took me 7 months after graduation to join the U.S. Army. My reasons to do so were three-fold - 12 Months for me 1.) The job I had (electrician apprentice) was not moving quick enough for me. I left a College Athletic Scholarship and deferment 2.) I felt 'unanchored' in life. i needed some sort of direction. I was also very timid at that time, basically scared of my own shadow. (A very long story about how that happened and how I'm still trying to get beyond those incidents.) I was pizzed because of flag-burning hippies, and two close friends had been killed in Viet Nam 3.) I felt a need to serve my country. I was made to feel, by our society in general, that I was a 'coward' if I didn't. My Dad and all my uncles saw combat in WWII I didn't raise my hand to go to Vietnam, though I could have.

It was great fun to watch and they really did get a new appreciation for what one does to prepare for service.. ..the daughter Sofie really did well and Gene, well, let's just say Gene was a proud father...lol ...next they headed to the Veterans Hospital in Long Beach, California where they took the time to say hello, thank you and listen to the stories from our soldiers... ...during this hospital visit Gene Simmons was choked up, moved to tears and could hardly get the words \"thank you\" out, it was so moving I was starting to sob... ...Gene knew after that experience he could not stop there, he went on to get several companies to participate and donate enough money to get a state of the art medic van with all the top of the line equiptment needed to care for the men and women of our military... ...Gene and his band members went back to San Diego, California and put on a free concert for our men and women, it was great! ...the band did each song, from each branch of our military and everyone had a fun time singing along. It was wonderful to see the men and women being honored... ...from that moment, I knew, I would always be a new found fan of Gene Simmons.

Outstanding!!! At the end of the show, Gene said, he had been drafted for the Vietnam war, his number was too high and he was passed on. He said, if called on, he would have gone to fight for America. America is that important to him that he would fight for her.

He is Jewish and was born in Israel to a mother who survived Nazi Concentration Camp: \"A self-described conservative on social policy issues, Simmons has described himself as a supporter of the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration.[3] He supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing on his website: \"I'm ashamed to be surrounded by people calling themselves liberal who are, in my opinion, spitting on the graves of brave American soldiers who gave their life to fight a war that wasn't theirs...in a country they've never been to... simply to liberate the people therein\".[4] In a follow-up, Simmons explained his position and wrote about his love and support for the United States: \"I wasn't born here. But I have a love for this country and its people that knows no bounds. I will forever be grateful to America for going into World War II, when it had nothing to gain, in a country that was far away... and rescued my mother from the Nazi German Concentration Camps. She is alive and I am alive because of America. And, if you have a problem with America, you have a problem with me\".[4] During the 2006 Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah, Simmons sent a televised message of support (in both English and Hebrew) to an Israeli soldier seriously wounded in fighting in Lebanon, calling him his \"hero.\"\" That explains his \"Pro-Armed Forces\" stance... But not too willing to get shot at himself. That's for the other guy - -",

The job I had (electrician apprentice) was not moving quick enough for me. 2.) I felt 'unanchored' in life. i needed some sort of direction. I was also very timid at that time, basically scared of my own shadow. (A very long story about how that happened and how I'm still trying to get beyond those incidents.) 3.) I felt a need to serve my country. I was made to feel, by our society in general, that I was a 'coward' if I didn't. I didn't raise my hand to go to Vietnam, though I could have. During 'Desert Shield/Desert Storm', i was in the IRR and could have volunteered to go, I didn't. During this current altercation, I was mobilized from the USAR to do duty in a stateside position. During that time I applied, and was accepted for an AGR tour. I find that as an AGR, I would not be the first choice for deployment, even if I were allowed to volunteer for deployment. Ergo, out of over 30 years of military service, in various positions, I have not been in combat. I am NOT alone in this position.

While he didn't serve, we all know that there isn't room in the services for ALL baby-boomers to serve, unless there were far fewer \"lifers\" than there normally is.
