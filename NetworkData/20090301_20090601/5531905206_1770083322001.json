That is the appropriate way for us, Americans all, to show our respect. Veterans organizations hawking poppies, pins and other trinkets do not increase respect for military service in any material way. Respect cannot be sold, it must be earned. If our political leaders, of both major parties, showed their concern for those who have served, the American people would respond. \"Flag wavers\" and \"summer soldiers and sunshine patriots\" (Tom Paine) don't accredit the value of service: they demean it.

But of course they should support an ONLINE VERIFIED VETERAN SUPPORTER campaign. Without these veterans who is going to die for the freedoms that they are enjoying now. It would be a good suggestion, in that way we shall know who are closet communists and Cuban spies like Obama,etc. How about looking at the other side. The negative side of the veterans. No negative feature of the veterans. They do not demand anything from anybody. No demand for money. No demand for priveleges. Not even a demand for recognnition before this ONLINE campaign would have start. My father died of bone marrow illness. He got it from too much medication for malaria which he suffered delivering courier for the anti-Japanese Philippine Hukbalahaps. He has to sleep in the forest and wake up in the morning to deliver very important messages that resulted in victory for the Hukbalahaps against the Japanese. Not only that. How do you see these penniless soldiers dying for free enterprise? If you are going to see it through communist persepective, they are fools dying for the moneyed elite. But the Bible says, \"No servant is better than his master\" hence contradicting Karl Marx's communist manifesto's \"Workers of the world, unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains'.",
