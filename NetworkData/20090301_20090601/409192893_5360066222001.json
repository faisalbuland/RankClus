This came to me via an e-mail \"forward it on campaign\". Even if you don't forward it to anyone else it will make you feel like you're not crazy anymore, and that other people feel much like you do. April 17, 2009 The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington , DC 20500 Mr. Obama: I have had it with you and your administration, sir. Your conduct on your recent trip overseas has convinced me that you are not an adequate representative of the United States of America collectively or of me personally. You are so obsessed with appeasing the Europeans and the Muslim world that you have abdicated the responsibilities of the President of the United States of America . You are responsible to the citizens of the United States. You are not responsible to the peoples of any other country on earth. I personally resent that you go around the world apologizing for the United States telling Europeans that we are arrogant and do not care about their status in the world. Sir, what do you think the First World War and the Second World War were all about if not the consideration of the peoples of Europe ? Are you brain dead? What do you think the Marshall Plan was all about? Do you not understand or know the history of the 20th century? Where do you get off telling a Muslim country that the United States does not consider itself a Christian country? Have you not read the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of the United States ? This country was founded on Judeo-Christian ethics and the principles governing this country, at least until you came along, come directly from this heritage. Do you not understand this? Your bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia is an affront to all Americans. Our President does not bow down to anyone, let alone the king of Saudi Arabia. You don't show Great Britain, our best and one of our oldest allies, the respect they deserve yet you bow down to the king of Saudi Arabia . How dare you, sir! How dare you ! You can't find the time to visit the graves of our greatest generation because you dont want to offend the Germans but make time to visit a mosque in Turkey. You offended our dead and every veteran when you give the Germans more respect than the people who saved the German people from themselves. Whats the matter with you? I am convinced that you and the members of your administration have the historical and intellectual depth of a mud puddle and should be ashamed of yourselves, all of you. You are so self-righteously offended by the big bankers and the American automobile manufacturers yet do nothing about the real thieves in this situation, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Frank, Franklin Raines, Jamie Gorelic, the Fannie Mae bonuses, and the Freddie Mac bonuses. What do you intend to do about them? Anything? I seriously doubt it. What about the U.S. House members passing out $9.1 million in bonuses to their staff members on top of the $2.5 million in automatic pay raises that lawmakers gave themselves? I understand the average House aide got a 17% bonus. I took a 5% cut in my pay to save jobs with my employer. You havent said anything about that. Who authorized that? I surely didnt! Executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be receiving $210 million in bonuses over an eighteen-month period, that's $45 million more than the AIG bonuses. In fact, Fannie and Freddie executives have already been awarded $51 million not a bad take. Who authorized that and why havent you expressed your outrage at this group who are largely responsible for the economic mess we have right now. I resent that you take me and my fellow citizens as brain-dead and not caring about what you idiots do. We are watching what you are doing and we are getting increasingly fed up with all of you. I also want you to know that I personally find just about everything you do and say to be offensive to every one of my sensibilities. I promise you that I will work tirelessly to see that you do not get a chance to spend two terms destroying my beautiful country.

ROBERT GATES: My pleasure. ZAKARIA: President Obama - you've heard a lot of Republican criticism that he's going around the world apologizing about America. Do you accept that? GATES: Well I'd like to remind people that when President George W. Bush came into office he talked about a more humble America. And you can go back to Theodore Roosevelt and his line about speaking softly but carrying a big stick. I think that acknowledging that we have made mistakes is not only factually accurate; I think that it is unusual because so few other governments in the world are willing to admit that. Although they make them all of the time, and some of them make catastrophic mistakes. And in speeches myself, I have said that at times we have acted too arrogantly. And I didn't feel that I was being apologetic for America, I just was saying \u2013 because the next -- I was just saying that that's the way we are in terms of being willing to recognize our own limitations. And when we make a mistake, to correct it. Because I think the next line that I always use is, no other country in the world is so self-critical and is so willing to change course when we feel that we've strayed from our values or when we feel like we've been too arrogant. So I think -- I have not seen it as an apology tour at all, but rather a change of tone, a more humble America. But everybody knows we still have the big stick. Gates wants his job. He has turned into the politician now.. Bush started him down that rode, Obama tweaked him. I thought Bush made a good choice when he picked Gates. I thought Obama made a good choice by keeping him on. His skill is obvious in many ways but the fact that two different presidents from two different parties with two almost opposite viewpoints considered him the best man for the job should speak for itself. I was wondering how some people would twist these statements by Gates. It's pretty disapointing.",

Failure to envision all possible scenarios and become fixated on one or two could have catastrophic consequences in 10-20 years.

ROBERT GATES: My pleasure. ZAKARIA: President Obama - you've heard a lot of Republican criticism that he's going around the world apologizing about America. Do you accept that? GATES: Well I'd like to remind people that when President George W. Bush came into office he talked about a more humble America. And you can go back to Theodore Roosevelt and his line about speaking softly but carrying a big stick. I think that acknowledging that we have made mistakes is not only factually accurate; I think that it is unusual because so few other governments in the world are willing to admit that. Although they make them all of the time, and some of them make catastrophic mistakes. And in speeches myself, I have said that at times we have acted too arrogantly. And I didn't feel that I was being apologetic for America, I just was saying \u2013 because the next -- I was just saying that that's the way we are in terms of being willing to recognize our own limitations. And when we make a mistake, to correct it. Because I think the next line that I always use is, no other country in the world is so self-critical and is so willing to change course when we feel that we've strayed from our values or when we feel like we've been too arrogant. So I think -- I have not seen it as an apology tour at all, but rather a change of tone, a more humble America. But everybody knows we still have the big stick. Gates wants his job. He has turned into the politician now.. Bush started him down that rode, Obama tweaked him. I thought Bush made a good choice when he picked Gates. I thought Obama made a good choice by keeping him on. His skill is obvious in many ways but the fact that two different presidents from two different parties with two almost opposite viewpoints considered him the best man for the job should speak for itself. I was wondering how some people would twist these statements by Gates. It's pretty disapointing.",

This came to me via an e-mail \"forward it on campaign\". Even if you don't forward it to anyone else it will make you feel like you're not crazy anymore, and that other people feel much like you do. April 17, 2009 The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington , DC 20500 Mr. Obama: I have had it with you and your administration, sir. Your conduct on your recent trip overseas has convinced me that you are not an adequate representative of the United States of America collectively or of me personally. You are so obsessed with appeasing the Europeans and the Muslim world that you have abdicated the responsibilities of the President of the United States of America . You are responsible to the citizens of the United States. You are not responsible to the peoples of any other country on earth. I personally resent that you go around the world apologizing for the United States telling Europeans that we are arrogant and do not care about their status in the world. Sir, what do you think the First World War and the Second World War were all about if not the consideration of the peoples of Europe ? Are you brain dead? What do you think the Marshall Plan was all about? Do you not understand or know the history of the 20th century? Where do you get off telling a Muslim country that the United States does not consider itself a Christian country? Have you not read the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of the United States ? This country was founded on Judeo-Christian ethics and the principles governing this country, at least until you came along, come directly from this heritage. Do you not understand this? Your bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia is an affront to all Americans. Our President does not bow down to anyone, let alone the king of Saudi Arabia. You don't show Great Britain, our best and one of our oldest allies, the respect they deserve yet you bow down to the king of Saudi Arabia . How dare you, sir! How dare you ! You can't find the time to visit the graves of our greatest generation because you dont want to offend the Germans but make time to visit a mosque in Turkey. You offended our dead and every veteran when you give the Germans more respect than the people who saved the German people from themselves. Whats the matter with you? I am convinced that you and the members of your administration have the historical and intellectual depth of a mud puddle and should be ashamed of yourselves, all of you. You are so self-righteously offended by the big bankers and the American automobile manufacturers yet do nothing about the real thieves in this situation, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Frank, Franklin Raines, Jamie Gorelic, the Fannie Mae bonuses, and the Freddie Mac bonuses. What do you intend to do about them? Anything? I seriously doubt it. What about the U.S. House members passing out $9.1 million in bonuses to their staff members on top of the $2.5 million in automatic pay raises that lawmakers gave themselves? I understand the average House aide got a 17% bonus. I took a 5% cut in my pay to save jobs with my employer. You havent said anything about that. Who authorized that? I surely didnt! Executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be receiving $210 million in bonuses over an eighteen-month period, that's $45 million more than the AIG bonuses. In fact, Fannie and Freddie executives have already been awarded $51 million not a bad take. Who authorized that and why havent you expressed your outrage at this group who are largely responsible for the economic mess we have right now. I resent that you take me and my fellow citizens as brain-dead and not caring about what you idiots do. We are watching what you are doing and we are getting increasingly fed up with all of you. I also want you to know that I personally find just about everything you do and say to be offensive to every one of my sensibilities. I promise you that I will work tirelessly to see that you do not get a chance to spend two terms destroying my beautiful country. Sincerely, Every real American Let the Obama-sycophants rant all they want... this Administration is without a doubt the biggest bunch of two-faced liars, criminals and thieves to ever inhabit DC and that takes some doing!",

ROBERT GATES: My pleasure. ZAKARIA: President Obama - you've heard a lot of Republican criticism that he's going around the world apologizing about America. Do you accept that?

I think that acknowledging that we have made mistakes is not only factually accurate; I think that it is unusual because so few other governments in the world are willing to admit that.

Because I think the next line that I always use is, no other country in the world is so self-critical and is so willing to change course when we feel that we've strayed from our values or when we feel like we've been too arrogant. So I think -- I have not seen it as an apology tour at all, but rather a change of tone, a more humble America. But everybody knows we still have the big stick.",

ROBERT GATES: My pleasure. ZAKARIA: President Obama - you've heard a lot of Republican criticism that he's going around the world apologizing about America. Do you accept that? GATES: Well I'd like to remind people that when President George W. Bush came into office he talked about a more humble America. And you can go back to Theodore Roosevelt and his line about speaking softly but carrying a big stick. I think that acknowledging that we have made mistakes is not only factually accurate; I think that it is unusual because so few other governments in the world are willing to admit that. Although they make them all of the time, and some of them make catastrophic mistakes. And in speeches myself, I have said that at times we have acted too arrogantly. And I didn't feel that I was being apologetic for America, I just was saying \u2013 because the next -- I was just saying that that's the way we are in terms of being willing to recognize our own limitations. And when we make a mistake, to correct it. Because I think the next line that I always use is, no other country in the world is so self-critical and is so willing to change course when we feel that we've strayed from our values or when we feel like we've been too arrogant. So I think -- I have not seen it as an apology tour at all, but rather a change of tone, a more humble America. But everybody knows we still have the big stick. Gates wants his job. He has turned into the politician now.. Bush started him down that rode, Obama tweaked him. I thought Bush made a good choice when he picked Gates. I thought Obama made a good choice by keeping him on. His skill is obvious in many ways but the fact that two different presidents from two different parties with two almost opposite viewpoints considered him the best man for the job should speak for itself. I was wondering how some people would twist these statements by Gates. It's pretty disapointing.",

ROBERT GATES: My pleasure. ZAKARIA: President Obama - you've heard a lot of Republican criticism that he's going around the world apologizing about America. Do you accept that? GATES: Well I'd like to remind people that when President George W. Bush came into office he talked about a more humble America. And you can go back to Theodore Roosevelt and his line about speaking softly but carrying a big stick. I think that acknowledging that we have made mistakes is not only factually accurate; I think that it is unusual because so few other governments in the world are willing to admit that. Although they make them all of the time, and some of them make catastrophic mistakes. And in speeches myself, I have said that at times we have acted too arrogantly. And I didn't feel that I was being apologetic for America, I just was saying \u2013 because the next -- I was just saying that that's the way we are in terms of being willing to recognize our own limitations. And when we make a mistake, to correct it. Because I think the next line that I always use is, no other country in the world is so self-critical and is so willing to change course when we feel that we've strayed from our values or when we feel like we've been too arrogant. So I think -- I have not seen it as an apology tour at all, but rather a change of tone, a more humble America. But everybody knows we still have the big stick. Gates wants his job. He has turned into the politician now.. Bush started him down that rode, Obama tweaked him. I thought Bush made a good choice when he picked Gates. I thought Obama made a good choice by keeping him on. His skill is obvious in many ways but the fact that two different presidents from two different parties with two almost opposite viewpoints considered him the best man for the job should speak for itself. I was wondering how some people would twist these statements by Gates. It's pretty disapointing.",

This came to me via an e-mail \"forward it on campaign\". Even if you don't forward it to anyone else it will make you feel like you're not crazy anymore, and that other people feel much like you do. April 17, 2009 The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington , DC 20500 Mr. Obama: I have had it with you and your administration, sir. Your conduct on your recent trip overseas has convinced me that you are not an adequate representative of the United States of America collectively or of me personally. You are so obsessed with appeasing the Europeans and the Muslim world that you have abdicated the responsibilities of the President of the United States of America . You are responsible to the citizens of the United States. You are not responsible to the peoples of any other country on earth. I personally resent that you go around the world apologizing for the United States telling Europeans that we are arrogant and do not care about their status in the world. Sir, what do you think the First World War and the Second World War were all about if not the consideration of the peoples of Europe ? Are you brain dead? What do you think the Marshall Plan was all about? Do you not understand or know the history of the 20th century? Where do you get off telling a Muslim country that the United States does not consider itself a Christian country? Have you not read the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of the United States ? This country was founded on Judeo-Christian ethics and the principles governing this country, at least until you came along, come directly from this heritage. Do you not understand this? Your bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia is an affront to all Americans. Our President does not bow down to anyone, let alone the king of Saudi Arabia. You don't show Great Britain, our best and one of our oldest allies, the respect they deserve yet you bow down to the king of Saudi Arabia . How dare you, sir! How dare you ! You can't find the time to visit the graves of our greatest generation because you dont want to offend the Germans but make time to visit a mosque in Turkey. You offended our dead and every veteran when you give the Germans more respect than the people who saved the German people from themselves. Whats the matter with you? I am convinced that you and the members of your administration have the historical and intellectual depth of a mud puddle and should be ashamed of yourselves, all of you. You are so self-righteously offended by the big bankers and the American automobile manufacturers yet do nothing about the real thieves in this situation, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Frank, Franklin Raines, Jamie Gorelic, the Fannie Mae bonuses, and the Freddie Mac bonuses. What do you intend to do about them? Anything? I seriously doubt it. What about the U.S. House members passing out $9.1 million in bonuses to their staff members on top of the $2.5 million in automatic pay raises that lawmakers gave themselves? I understand the average House aide got a 17% bonus. I took a 5% cut in my pay to save jobs with my employer. You havent said anything about that. Who authorized that? I surely didnt! Executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be receiving $210 million in bonuses over an eighteen-month period, that's $45 million more than the AIG bonuses. In fact, Fannie and Freddie executives have already been awarded $51 million not a bad take. Who authorized that and why havent you expressed your outrage at this group who are largely responsible for the economic mess we have right now. I resent that you take me and my fellow citizens as brain-dead and not caring about what you idiots do. We are watching what you are doing and we are getting increasingly fed up with all of you. I also want you to know that I personally find just about everything you do and say to be offensive to every one of my sensibilities. I promise you that I will work tirelessly to see that you do not get a chance to spend two terms destroying my beautiful country. Sincerely, Every real American Let the Obama-sycophants rant all they want... this Administration is without a doubt the biggest bunch of two-faced liars, criminals and thieves to ever inhabit DC and that takes some doing!",

ROBERT GATES: My pleasure. ZAKARIA: President Obama - you've heard a lot of Republican criticism that he's going around the world apologizing about America. Do you accept that? GATES: Well I'd like to remind people that when President George W. Bush came into office he talked about a more humble America. And you can go back to Theodore Roosevelt and his line about speaking softly but carrying a big stick. I think that acknowledging that we have made mistakes is not only factually accurate; I think that it is unusual because so few other governments in the world are willing to admit that. Although they make them all of the time, and some of them make catastrophic mistakes. And in speeches myself, I have said that at times we have acted too arrogantly. And I didn't feel that I was being apologetic for America, I just was saying \u2013 because the next -- I was just saying that that's the way we are in terms of being willing to recognize our own limitations. And when we make a mistake, to correct it. Because I think the next line that I always use is, no other country in the world is so self-critical and is so willing to change course when we feel that we've strayed from our values or when we feel like we've been too arrogant. So I think -- I have not seen it as an apology tour at all, but rather a change of tone, a more humble America. But everybody knows we still have the big stick. Gates wants his job. He has turned into the politician now.. Bush started him down that rode, Obama tweaked him. I thought Bush made a good choice when he picked Gates. I thought Obama made a good choice by keeping him on. His skill is obvious in many ways but the fact that two different presidents from two different parties with two almost opposite viewpoints considered him the best man for the job should speak for itself. I was wondering how some people would twist these statements by Gates. It's pretty disapointing.",

ROBERT GATES: My pleasure. ZAKARIA: President Obama - you've heard a lot of Republican criticism that he's going around the world apologizing about America. Do you accept that? GATES: Well I'd like to remind people that when President George W. Bush came into office he talked about a more humble America. And you can go back to Theodore Roosevelt and his line about speaking softly but carrying a big stick. I think that acknowledging that we have made mistakes is not only factually accurate; I think that it is unusual because so few other governments in the world are willing to admit that. Although they make them all of the time, and some of them make catastrophic mistakes. And in speeches myself, I have said that at times we have acted too arrogantly. And I didn't feel that I was being apologetic for America, I just was saying \u2013 because the next -- I was just saying that that's the way we are in terms of being willing to recognize our own limitations. And when we make a mistake, to correct it. Because I think the next line that I always use is, no other country in the world is so self-critical and is so willing to change course when we feel that we've strayed from our values or when we feel like we've been too arrogant. So I think -- I have not seen it as an apology tour at all, but rather a change of tone, a more humble America. But everybody knows we still have the big stick. Gates wants his job. He has turned into the politician now.. Bush started him down that rode, Obama tweaked him. I thought Bush made a good choice when he picked Gates. I thought Obama made a good choice by keeping him on. His skill is obvious in many ways but the fact that two different presidents from two different parties with two almost opposite viewpoints considered him the best man for the job should speak for itself. I was wondering how some people would twist these statements by Gates. It's pretty disapointing.",
