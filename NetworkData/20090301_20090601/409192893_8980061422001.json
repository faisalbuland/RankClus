I deleted all the links but left the addresses so folks can bird-dog it for themselves. If you haven\u2019t heard the Cloward/Piven Strategy you should Google it and read about it somewhat. It only takes a few minutes. In fact, if you Google Cloward-Piven \u2013 Obama \u2013 Alinsky you\u2019ll come up with sorts of information. Yep, there are some who will dismiss it \u2013 but if eve they do their homework and simply read what is being exposed \u2013 then look at what is going on around us \u2013 well, one thing is FOR SURE \u2013 we will SOON find out!

You guys know all the little stuff - so what is the Cloward/Piven Strategy? Rather than placating the poor with government hand-outs, wrote Cloward and Piven, activists should work to sabotage and destroy the welfare system; the collapse of the welfare state would ignite a political and financial crisis that would rock the nation... [Emphasis added.] Making an already weak economy even worse is the intent of the Cloward/Piven Strategy. It is imperative that we view the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan's (link below) spending on items like food stamps, jobless benefits (link below), and health care (link below) through this end goal. This strategy explains why the Democrat plan to \"stimulate\" the economy involves massive deficit spending projects. It includes billions for ACORN and its subgroups such as SHOP (link below) and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (link below).

It is bitter irony that the American taxpayer will actually fund the destruction of our own ability to live according to the values of our Founding Documents.

The Democrat stimulus plan provides for welfare expansion but not for a robust economy that creates high paying jobs. Is this what Obama means when he warns, \"It's going to get worse before it gets better?\" If we are not bailing out corporate America so they can regain profitability, we must conclude Obama is working toward another end goal.
