Shellenberger of Milford Township signaled for help, could not be revived By Matt Assad | OF THE MORNING CALL May 10, 2009 \"A Navy SEAL from upper Bucks County who survived seven tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and made a career of executing some of the military's most dangerous missions died Thursday during a diving exercise in Washington state. Eric F. Shellenberger, who lived in Milford Township, near Pennsburg in Montgomery County, experienced problems during a training dive and signaled for emergency ascent, but could not be revived, according to Navy officials. Shellenberger, 36, was a Special Warfare Operator with an elite unit of the Navy SEALS that uses a mini-submarine designed to conduct covert missions in enemy waters.\" \"Shellenberger was assigned to the SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One in Pearl City, Hawaii, according to Navy spokesman Scott Williams. It's the only team in the military that operates a mini-submarine used by the Navy to sneak into enemy waters for missions such as collecting intelligence and planting explosives on enemy ships. In some cases, Shellenberger and his unit were asked to swim from the submersible and go ashore on missions that Williams said are too sensitive to discuss. When not in the water, Shellenberger was among a team of SEALS assigned to missions to locate and eliminate ''high-value'' targets and terrorist leaders, including serving as Assault Team Leader in Ramadi, Iraq, during the ''Sunni Awakening'' in 2006-07, Williams said.\" From: \"http://www.mcall.com/news/local/all-a1_5seal.6895150may10,0,5900448.story\" \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",
