I have invented the IIWS(Individual Invisible Weapon System), the IIWS is a new-generation, invisible infantry weapon designed for effectiveness against OICW (Objective Individual Combat Weapon) and AICW (Advanced Infantry Combat Weapon) , because OICW, AICW and all kinds of soldier combat system utilise traditional face to face shot mode, and must expose their two hands at least. If you use OICW and AICW, you can't hit what you can't see and if the enemy is in range. The IIWS means both invisible weapon and a invisible shooter, Compared with the existing weapon, there are not any difference in accuracy and range. You thought smart arms were cool. Well, this IIWS takes smart weapons to the next level. Imagine a city being attacked by your enemy. Both your enemy and you are using conventional arms, But you have the advantage, you have a IIWS, you may conceal yourself behind heavy bullet proof shelters. Your weapon has the function of \u201cHiding User\u201d. Now that you may take cover from the enemy\u2019s fire, you may strike at the enemy from every conceivable cover, you may hit the enemy when they least expected you too. You don't need to directly face the enemy like current arms. You point your gun to their position, you can press many many enemy hard by yourself. which will be perfect and secure. With the IIWS, straight aiming line is no longer a rule for infantry fights! It will be widely being used by Special Forces, military units and law enforcement agencies around the world. I seek to transfer this technology or to cooperate with you to develop it, if ur friend like it, tell me via Email pls. Email: taolyt@yahoo.com.cn",
