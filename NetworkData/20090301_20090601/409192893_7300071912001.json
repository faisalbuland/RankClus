Not only that, but we will turn the experience into an educational opportunity for our children. We will tell stories, sing songs and see what stars or planets we can identify. Thats the real rub right there:authorized. You think, no you like being authorized. You like being told how to live your life. You think someone has the RIGHT to authorize you to do something.

Sure, we can all shut our lights. Nothing wrong about it. The agenda of many behind much of this is not about saving anything. It is to burden citizens with more taxes. It is also to create a new bogus market, that will make oil futures look like childs play. That is what I am sure many of us are against. Maybe not you and some others who post on here....but many of us. Shut your lights, your computer, take a walk to the park, hang out outside, and whatever else. If you can, keep them off until the morning. That would make more of a difference than an hour. The topic of this thread is \u201cEarth Hour\u201d! Shutting off completely for an hour....nothing more nothing less! It was started in Australia two years ago, and has nothing to do with Cap, Trade, Taxes or any other nonsense you guys are trying to interject with! I posted a link hoping people would actually take the time and go over and read it, before making assumptions & crying bloody murder!",

It is also to create a new bogus market, that will make oil futures look like childs play. That is what I am sure many of us are against.
