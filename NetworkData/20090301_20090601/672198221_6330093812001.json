Propaganda of fueling the Savak is hogwash, I hope you're not buying into the Great Satan BS. The only ones pulling for Iran were fellow Shiite. Whoa, one more, Jimmy Carter. Jimmy CArter did all that he could to stop the Mullahs, short of war. Would you have supported war? You say we did little to help Iraq. No doubt that's reassuring - But you are mistaken. We prevented them from invading Iraq by sea. We bombed and sank their ships. We supplied Iraq with all the chemical precursors needed for their chemical arms. Do you really call that \"little?\" Or is this aid somehow excused because others also gave aid to Sadaam? But let's go back further - We overthrew Mousadagh. In other words, we installed a Fascist dictator - Who cares how much money we gave the secret police? Once in power the Shah didn't need our money. Now, none of the above makes the Mullahs of Iran a more attractive group. But they are statements of undisputable fact. Do we want to live in a pretend world? Or can we face up to the truth? Obama has broken the ice. I see no reason for him to \"apologise\" to Iran, because there has been so much water under the Bridge. Nor do I think that Almidinajad is a suitable negotiatiing partner - Nevertheless, we're not going to get rid of him by building him up, as Mr. Bush built him up. Iranians know their own history, and when Mr. Bush gave his speech demanding they elect anyone but Almdinajad, Mr. Bush assured the election of Almidinajad.

The intell was free as charge but look at what would have happened if Khomeini revolution took Iraq. Would Kuwait and Saudi be far behind? Propaganda of fueling the Savak is hogwash, I hope you're not buying into the Great Satan BS. The only ones pulling for Iran were fellow Shiite. Whoa, one more, Jimmy Carter.", 
        "reply": " Jimmy CArter did all that he could to stop the Mullahs, short of war. Would you have supported war? You say we did little to help Iraq. No doubt that's reassuring - But you are mistaken. We prevented them from invading Iraq by sea. We bombed and sank their ships. We supplied Iraq with all the chemical precursors needed for their chemical arms. Do you really call that \"little?\" Or is this aid somehow excused because others also gave aid to Sadaam? But let's go back further - We overthrew Mousadagh. In other words, we installed a Fascist dictator - Who cares how much money we gave the secret police? Once in power the Shah didn't need our money. Now, none of the above makes the Mullahs of Iran a more attractive group. But they are statements of undisputable fact. Do we want to live in a pretend world? Or can we face up to the truth? Obama has broken the ice. I see no reason for him to \"apologise\" to Iran, because there has been so much water under the Bridge. Nor do I think that Almidinajad is a suitable negotiatiing partner - Nevertheless, we're not going to get rid of him by building him up, as Mr. Bush built him up.

Jimmy CArter did all that he could to stop the Mullahs, short of war. Would you have supported war? You say we did little to help Iraq. No doubt that's reassuring - But you are mistaken. We prevented them from invading Iraq by sea. We bombed and sank their ships. We supplied Iraq with all the chemical precursors needed for their chemical arms. Do you really call that \"little?\" Or is this aid somehow excused because others also gave aid to Sadaam? But let's go back further - We overthrew Mousadagh. In other words, we installed a Fascist dictator - Who cares how much money we gave the secret police? Once in power the Shah didn't need our money. Now, none of the above makes the Mullahs of Iran a more attractive group. But they are statements of undisputable fact. Do we want to live in a pretend world? Or can we face up to the truth? Obama has broken the ice. I see no reason for him to \"apologise\" to Iran, because there has been so much water under the Bridge. Nor do I think that Almidinajad is a suitable negotiatiing partner - Nevertheless, we're not going to get rid of him by building him up, as Mr. Bush built him up. Iranians know their own history, and when Mr. Bush gave his speech demanding they elect anyone but Almdinajad, Mr. Bush assured the election of Almidinajad. People are suppoed to learn from their mistakes, not repeat them. Dave",
