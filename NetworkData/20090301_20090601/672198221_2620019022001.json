People want to either drive or fly and the supporting infrastructure of food service, rental car and ground transportation is geared to those industries. Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC? There are NO facilites for food service or rental cars for miles, and the stations consist of a single ticket window and a waiting room smaller than my dentist's. Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem. Throwing millions of $$s at it isn't going to bring the customers and services to the stations anytime soon. Sullivan013",

Once Uncle Sugar gets around to slapping about a $8/gallon federal tax on gasoline, I think there will be a lot more people on the train. Not that I agree with the concept of $10 gas, but it's coming, and we need an affordable means to get from point A to B when it does. It's successful in Europe because the government uses high taxes on gasoline and diessl to fund public trans, and that leads to high use of public trans and trains for transportation. A train system is no more a money pit than are the roads and planes that are heavily subsidized by tax dollars. The airlines have to file bankruptcy and go to Uncle Sugar every few years. We won't even get into how much tax money is dumped into DOT boondoggles.",

Then in the late 1970s, the Kennedy's, er I mean the democratic party, thought that anyone who could afford the price of a bus ticket, should be able to fly and deregulated the airline industry and it has degenerated to what it is today... Has anyone noticed the vast distances that a high speed rail system would have to transit in the U.S., as opposed to Japan, France and the other E.U. nations?... Talk about an opportunity for some of this nations enemies to sabotage rails and bridges, especially in the \"open and isolated\" areas in the mountains and across the deserts?... Can you also say \"flash floods\" and \"rock slides\", kinda of tough thing to hit at 65 and 70 MPH, let alone at say around 300 MPH... Just wondering... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside.

Once Uncle Sugar gets around to slapping about a $8/gallon federal tax on gasoline, I think there will be a lot more people on the train. Not that I agree with the concept of $10 gas, but it's coming, and we need an affordable means to get from point A to B when it does. It's successful in Europe because the government uses high taxes on gasoline and diessl to fund public trans, and that leads to high use of public trans and trains for transportation. A train system is no more a money pit than are the roads and planes that are heavily subsidized by tax dollars. The airlines have to file bankruptcy and go to Uncle Sugar every few years.

Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem.

Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem. Throwing millions of $$s at it isn't going to bring the customers and services to the stations anytime soon. Sullivan013",

Us not having it, is testimony to the unconstitutional influence big oil and banks have over our city, state, and federal gov'ts. many always say \"Pfffft\" \"that would take a big conspiracy\", no, it would not. Create positions of wealth and power and those that fill those positions will do whatever it takes to maintain them. The reason that \"rail travel\" went out was and is, that freight was the \"bread and butter\" of the rail industry, passenger service was a \"side business\"... Before \"air travel\", \"rail travel\" was all that you had... Air travel was never intended to be \"mass\" transit, as it is today... Air travel was always intended to be high speed travel, for those that could afford it and not \"mass\" transit... As air travel improved, better aircraft, pressurized cabins, so that you could fly above the weather and over the mountains, instead of \"down in it\" and \"through the mountains\", more and more people began to use air travel over train travel... Then in the late 1970s, the Kennedy's, er I mean the democratic party, thought that anyone who could afford the price of a bus ticket, should be able to fly and deregulated the airline industry and it has degenerated to what it is today...

        "reply": " The reason that \"rail travel\" went out was and is, that freight was the \"bread and butter\" of the rail industry, passenger service was a \"side business\"... Before \"air travel\", \"rail travel\" was all that you had... Air travel was never intended to be \"mass\" transit, as it is today... Air travel was always intended to be high speed travel, for those that could afford it and not \"mass\" transit... As air travel improved, better aircraft, pressurized cabins, so that you could fly above the weather and over the mountains, instead of \"down in it\" and \"through the mountains\", more and more people began to use air travel over train travel... Then in the late 1970s, the Kennedy's, er I mean the democratic party, thought that anyone who could afford the price of a bus ticket, should be able to fly and deregulated the airline industry and it has degenerated to what it is today...

If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside.

Once Uncle Sugar gets around to slapping about a $8/gallon federal tax on gasoline, I think there will be a lot more people on the train. Not that I agree with the concept of $10 gas, but it's coming, and we need an affordable means to get from point A to B when it does. It's successful in Europe because the government uses high taxes on gasoline and diessl to fund public trans, and that leads to high use of public trans and trains for transportation. A train system is no more a money pit than are the roads and planes that are heavily subsidized by tax dollars. The airlines have to file bankruptcy and go to Uncle Sugar every few years.

The market for passenger rail traffic in Europe is over a century old. In America? It hasn't been viable since the 1940s. Cargo, yes. Passengers, no. People want to either drive or fly and the supporting infrastructure of food service, rental car and ground transportation is geared to those industries. Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC? There are NO facilites for food service or rental cars for miles, and the stations consist of a single ticket window and a waiting room smaller than my dentist's. Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem. Throwing millions of $$s at it isn't going to bring the customers and services to the stations anytime soon. Sullivan013",

        "reply": "Not to mention, every mile of track would require upgrade to support the increase in speed. This is a monumental expenditure for a non-consumer driven service. The market for passenger rail traffic in Europe is over a century old. In America? It hasn't been viable since the 1940s. Cargo, yes. Passengers, no. People want to either drive or fly and the supporting infrastructure of food service, rental car and ground transportation is geared to those industries. Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC?

Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC? There are NO facilites for food service or rental cars for miles, and the stations consist of a single ticket window and a waiting room smaller than my dentist's. Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem.

Once Uncle Sugar gets around to slapping about a $8/gallon federal tax on gasoline, I think there will be a lot more people on the train.

It's successful in Europe because the government uses high taxes on gasoline and diessl to fund public trans, and that leads to high use of public trans and trains for transportation.

The market for passenger rail traffic in Europe is over a century old. In America? It hasn't been viable since the 1940s. Cargo, yes. Passengers, no. People want to either drive or fly and the supporting infrastructure of food service, rental car and ground transportation is geared to those industries. Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC? There are NO facilites for food service or rental cars for miles, and the stations consist of a single ticket window and a waiting room smaller than my dentist's. Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem. Throwing millions of $$s at it isn't going to bring the customers and services to the stations anytime soon. Sullivan013",

Assuming a train moving at 200 MPH did not have tyo make any stops (not economically likely), it would take 3.5 hours to make such a trip...opposed to 1.5 hours on an airplane. The longer the trip the greater loss of time with a 3000 mile train trip taking 15 hrs vs. a 6 hour plane ride to cover the same distance. You also have to factor in the time it takes to park your car at the airport, take the shuttle to the terminal and get through security. Then there are all those pesky weather and ATC delays. At the other end you have to find your way out of the airport, find your baggage and get to ground transportation.",

It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside.

Once Uncle Sugar gets around to slapping about a $8/gallon federal tax on gasoline, I think there will be a lot more people on the train.

The market for passenger rail traffic in Europe is over a century old. In America? It hasn't been viable since the 1940s. Cargo, yes. Passengers, no. People want to either drive or fly and the supporting infrastructure of food service, rental car and ground transportation is geared to those industries. Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC? There are NO facilites for food service or rental cars for miles, and the stations consist of a single ticket window and a waiting room smaller than my dentist's. Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem. Throwing millions of $$s at it isn't going to bring the customers and services to the stations anytime soon. Sullivan013",

Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC? There are NO facilites for food service or rental cars for miles, and the stations consist of a single ticket window and a waiting room smaller than my dentist's. Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside.

Assuming a train moving at 200 MPH did not have tyo make any stops (not economically likely), it would take 3.5 hours to make such a trip...opposed to 1.5 hours on an airplane. The longer the trip the greater loss of time with a 3000 mile train trip taking 15 hrs vs. a 6 hour plane ride to cover the same distance. High speed rail can move fright as well as passengers. It's not a luxury item, it's a necessity for the rapid and cheap movement of goods. Without such a system we are rapidly losing our competitive edge over other modern countries. Complaining about entering the 21st Century is not a good idea. This is LONG overdue. Dave",

Once Uncle Sugar gets around to slapping about a $8/gallon federal tax on gasoline, I think there will be a lot more people on the train.

It's successful in Europe because the government uses high taxes on gasoline and diessl to fund public trans, and that leads to high use of public trans and trains for transportation.

The market for passenger rail traffic in Europe is over a century old. In America? It hasn't been viable since the 1940s. Cargo, yes. Passengers, no. People want to either drive or fly and the supporting infrastructure of food service, rental car and ground transportation is geared to those industries. Ever been to the AMTRAK station in a city like Birmingham AL? Charlotte NC? There are NO facilites for food service or rental cars for miles, and the stations consist of a single ticket window and a waiting room smaller than my dentist's. Also, Charlotte's trains stop between 1 and 2 AM. That's it. No other times are available. If you miss your train, you can either drive 30 minutes to beat it to the next station by five minutes, or wait another day. Don't get me wrong, I love to travel by rail. It's more comfortable, relaxed and I don't feel like a sardine in the seat. But it isn't viable stateside. There just isn't demand necessary to increase the service between cities, no matter how economical it might seem. Throwing millions of $$s at it isn't going to bring the customers and services to the stations anytime soon. Sullivan013",

You also have to factor in the time it takes to park your car at the airport, take the shuttle to the terminal and get through security. Then there are all those pesky weather and ATC delays. At the other end you have to find your way out of the airport, find your baggage and get to ground transportation. As opposed to just hoping on a train with a bomb. You're changing the subject. How many times has that happened here?", 
        "reply": " How many times have terrorist flown planes into buildings before 9 -11? It's a strawman arguement either way. I think it would be great to have some high speed rails, I just don't see it finished in our lifetime. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?\" - Joseph Stalin",
