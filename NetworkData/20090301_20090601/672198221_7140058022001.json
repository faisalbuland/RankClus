There already ARE larger seats - First Class and Business Class. You pay more for them because you take up more space, and space is at a premium on an airplane. I'll admit, the airline seats these days are too crowded for anyone bigger than a 10-year-old or a midget to be truly comfortable. I have a co-worker who is 6'4\", and even though he's not fat, it's really tough for him to squeeze into the seats because his knees hit the seat in front of him. So I'll agree... the seats are just too dang small for normal human beings to be comfortable. But to simply FIT in the seat... yeah, normal-sized people can fit in those seats just fine, even if they're not exactly comfortable. I'm short - 5'1\" - and I fit economy class seats as comfortably as anyone could, aside from children and midgets. I'm also not fat. This is because I eat a healthy diet and exercise about 5 times per week. There's no mystery, no magic trick. If I didn't exercise, and if I lived on a steady diet of Supersize Value Meals at the local fast food slop house, I'd be rounder than a beach ball, and I wouldn't fit the economy class seats on airplanes either, no matter how short I am. OBESITY IS NOT A DISABILITY. In 99% of obese people, it's a sign of gluttony and sloth, two of those \"deadly sins.\" So, getting back to the point... I'm short and small, and I fit airline economy class seats pretty well. HOWEVER, if I pay for my seat, I don't want someone's fat rolls or bulbous arms taking up even a fraction of an inch of the seat that I BOUGHT. My seat. My precious inches of space on that hideously cramped flight. Not yours. Not sharing. You buy your own. You don't get to use mine. The worst thing is when some fatty thinks that BECAUSE I'm small, that gives him/her the right to use part of my space, just because it's physically possible. I'm sorry, but we're not that good friends, dude. You want space to spread out, you buy it. Don't make me uncomfortable because you couldn't lay off the Big Macs. Oh, here's a really sad thing I just saw... our hospital just bought another dozen wheelchairs... ALL OVERSIZED. The patients keep getting fatter and fatter, and they don't fit the regular wheelchairs. Pathetic.",

I'm short - 5'1\" - and I fit economy class seats as comfortably as anyone could, aside from children and midgets. I'm also not fat. This is because I eat a healthy diet and exercise about 5 times per week. There's no mystery, no magic trick. If I didn't exercise, and if I lived on a steady diet of Supersize Value Meals at the local fast food slop house, I'd be rounder than a beach ball, and I wouldn't fit the economy class seats on airplanes either, no matter how short I am. OBESITY IS NOT A DISABILITY. In 99% of obese people, it's a sign of gluttony and sloth, two of those \"deadly sins.\" So, getting back to the point... I'm short and small, and I fit airline economy class seats pretty well. HOWEVER, if I pay for my seat, I don't want someone's fat rolls or bulbous arms taking up even a fraction of an inch of the seat that I BOUGHT. My seat. My precious inches of space on that hideously cramped flight. Not yours. Not sharing. You buy your own. You don't get to use mine. The worst thing is when some fatty thinks that BECAUSE I'm small, that gives him/her the right to use part of my space, just because it's physically possible. I'm sorry, but we're not that good friends, dude. You want space to spread out, you buy it. Don't make me uncomfortable because you couldn't lay off the Big Macs. Oh, here's a really sad thing I just saw... our hospital just bought another dozen wheelchairs... ALL OVERSIZED. The patients keep getting fatter and fatter, and they don't fit the regular wheelchairs. Pathetic.",

I've started to look more at train travel whenever it's possible, but our passenger train system in this country is absolutely pitiful. I took the Chief from Kansas City to Chicago last summer, and because of delays and other issues, the trip went from 6 hours to over 8 hours. However, it was fun to stretch out, the dining car was fun, and I could actually bring my sewing supplies (including scissors!) on the train to finish part of a costume I was bringing to the event in Chicago during the trip. I was even able to bring an icy cold six-pack of my favorite beer to drink during the ride! Trains are great... they just take forever. I hope we modernize our rail system soon. We're so far behind other advanced nations that it's sad.",

There already ARE larger seats - First Class and Business Class. You pay more for them because you take up more space, and space is at a premium on an airplane. I'll admit, the airline seats these days are too crowded for anyone bigger than a 10-year-old or a midget to be truly comfortable. I have a co-worker who is 6'4\", and even though he's not fat, it's really tough for him to squeeze into the seats because his knees hit the seat in front of him. So I'll agree... the seats are just too dang small for normal human beings to be comfortable. But to simply FIT in the seat... yeah, normal-sized people can fit in those seats just fine, even if they're not exactly comfortable. I'm short - 5'1\" - and I fit economy class seats as comfortably as anyone could, aside from children and midgets. I'm also not fat. This is because I eat a healthy diet and exercise about 5 times per week. There's no mystery, no magic trick. If I didn't exercise, and if I lived on a steady diet of Supersize Value Meals at the local fast food slop house, I'd be rounder than a beach ball, and I wouldn't fit the economy class seats on airplanes either, no matter how short I am. OBESITY IS NOT A DISABILITY. In 99% of obese people, it's a sign of gluttony and sloth, two of those \"deadly sins.\" So, getting back to the point... I'm short and small, and I fit airline economy class seats pretty well. HOWEVER, if I pay for my seat, I don't want someone's fat rolls or bulbous arms taking up even a fraction of an inch of the seat that I BOUGHT. My seat. My precious inches of space on that hideously cramped flight. Not yours. Not sharing. You buy your own. You don't get to use mine. The worst thing is when some fatty thinks that BECAUSE I'm small, that gives him/her the right to use part of my space, just because it's physically possible. I'm sorry, but we're not that good friends, dude. You want space to spread out, you buy it. Don't make me uncomfortable because you couldn't lay off the Big Macs. Oh, here's a really sad thing I just saw... our hospital just bought another dozen wheelchairs... ALL OVERSIZED. The patients keep getting fatter and fatter, and they don't fit the regular wheelchairs. Pathetic.",

I've started to look more at train travel whenever it's possible, but our passenger train system in this country is absolutely pitiful. I took the Chief from Kansas City to Chicago last summer, and because of delays and other issues, the trip went from 6 hours to over 8 hours. However, it was fun to stretch out, the dining car was fun, and I could actually bring my sewing supplies (including scissors!) on the train to finish part of a costume I was bringing to the event in Chicago during the trip.

Under the rules outlined by United, passengers who \"are unable to fit into a single seat in the ticketed cabin; are unable to properly buckle the seatbelt using a single seatbelt extender; and/or are unable to put the seat's armrests down when seated\" will be denied boarding unless they purchase an extra seat. If no empty seat exists, the passenger will be forced to take a later flight. \"The seat purchase or upgrade must be completed for each leg of the itinerary,\" the United policy states. \"If a customer meeting any of the above-listed criteria decides not to upgrade or purchase a ticket for an additional seat, he or she will not be permitted to board the flight.\" The policy applies to tickets bought on or after March 4, for travel on Wednesday or later, according to the United Web site. <more> \"http://cbs2chicago.com/business/united.overweight.passengers.2.985271.html\"",

There already ARE larger seats - First Class and Business Class. You pay more for them because you take up more space, and space is at a premium on an airplane. I'll admit, the airline seats these days are too crowded for anyone bigger than a 10-year-old or a midget to be truly comfortable. I have a co-worker who is 6'4\", and even though he's not fat, it's really tough for him to squeeze into the seats because his knees hit the seat in front of him. So I'll agree... the seats are just too dang small for normal human beings to be comfortable. But to simply FIT in the seat... yeah, normal-sized people can fit in those seats just fine, even if they're not exactly comfortable. I'm short - 5'1\" - and I fit economy class seats as comfortably as anyone could, aside from children and midgets. I'm also not fat. This is because I eat a healthy diet and exercise about 5 times per week. There's no mystery, no magic trick. If I didn't exercise, and if I lived on a steady diet of Supersize Value Meals at the local fast food slop house, I'd be rounder than a beach ball, and I wouldn't fit the economy class seats on airplanes either, no matter how short I am. OBESITY IS NOT A DISABILITY. In 99% of obese people, it's a sign of gluttony and sloth, two of those \"deadly sins.\" So, getting back to the point... I'm short and small, and I fit airline economy class seats pretty well. HOWEVER, if I pay for my seat, I don't want someone's fat rolls or bulbous arms taking up even a fraction of an inch of the seat that I BOUGHT. My seat. My precious inches of space on that hideously cramped flight. Not yours. Not sharing. You buy your own. You don't get to use mine. The worst thing is when some fatty thinks that BECAUSE I'm small, that gives him/her the right to use part of my space, just because it's physically possible. I'm sorry, but we're not that good friends, dude. You want space to spread out, you buy it. Don't make me uncomfortable because you couldn't lay off the Big Macs. Oh, here's a really sad thing I just saw... our hospital just bought another dozen wheelchairs... ALL OVERSIZED. The patients keep getting fatter and fatter, and they don't fit the regular wheelchairs. Pathetic.",
