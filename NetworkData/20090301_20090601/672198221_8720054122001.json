The court held that the individual right to bear arms recognized last year by the U.S. Supreme Court binds state and local governments, but nonetheless rejected a challenge to an Alameda County ordinance prohibiting firearms on county property. Writing for the court, Judge Diarmuid F. O\u2019Scannlain explained that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783, \u201ctells us that the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee revolves around armed self-defense,\u201d and concluded the ordinance did not meaningfully impede individuals\u2019 ability to defend themselves in their homes. O\u2019Scannlain\u2014joined by Judge Ronald M. Gould, who concurred separately, and Senior Judge Arthur L. Alarc\u00f3n\u2014similarly rejected First Amendment claims in a suit by promoters of gun shows at county fairgrounds. Russell and Ann Nor****, as TS Trade Shows, promoted the gun shows from 1991 until the county enacted the ordinance in 1999 after a shooting at the fairgrounds. Exception Created The ordinance was subsequently amended to provide an exception for certain artistic events after representatives of the Scottish Caledonian Games inquired about the law\u2019s applicability to their activities, which included reenactments with period firearms loaded with blank ammunition. Contending the ordinance was enacted to silence members of the \u2018gun culture\u2019 from expressing their political and social views, the Nor****s brought a federal civil rights suit under both the First and Second Amendment. However, then-U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins of the Northern District of California\u2014now a justice of the First District Court of Appeal\u2014said they were unlikely to prevail and denied a preliminary injunction. The Nor****s appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and in 2000 the court certified the case\u2014along with one brought against Los Angeles County\u2014to the California Supreme Court to determine whether state gun laws preempted the ordinances. The California Supreme Court held there was no preemption, and the Ninth Circuit then ruled in 2003 that the Nor****s lacked standing to pursue their Second Amendment claim under circuit precedent interpreting the amendment to provide a collective right that applied only to state-regulated militias. The Ninth Circuit also rejected the Nor****s\u2019 claim that the sale of guns at shows was a form of advocacy or commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. On remand, the Nor****s sought leave to amend their complaint to allege a violation of the Second Amendment, citing the then-pending case of Heller, but Jenkins denied the motion. They also rephrased their First Amendment challenge, arguing the ordinance violated their freedom of expression by making gun shows impossible and alleged a violation of equal protection, but Jenkins granted summary judgment for the county.
