It should be a lump sum (in theory), but he needs to pay attention to his LES every month, and you both need to be patient, you know how military pay goes. I'm glad they've finally enacted the legislation, and that they plan to phase out the program. I was stop lossed 10 months, and only four months of that was since October 1st. But I'm not complaining about the money, just so long as Stop Loss ENDS soon, for the sake of people still serving.",
