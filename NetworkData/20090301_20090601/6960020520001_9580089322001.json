Enlisting persons from countries with no proper records means you can never be sure who you are in fact dealing with. Large numbers of immigrants can lead to a situation where, because they are immigrants, they claim unfair treatment thereby gaining advantage over non immigrants. However it is my opinion \"for what it may be worth\" that anybody willing to risk death defending a country should be allowed to live in it and be treated as an equal. For example the UK has just given Gurkha soldiers the right to settle in the UK, this was forced upon an unwilling government by the citizens of the UK who have a powerful sense of \"fair play\". The same government deported an ex military woman who was an american citizen living in the UK looking after her seriously ill mother and drawing a US military pension as her only income. This really inteligent decision meant that having deported the carer and seperated Mother and Daughter they then had to put the mother in a home at UK taxpayers expense. We have yet to convey to people that although Governments make decisions the policy enactment is done by the same people no matter which way we vote, these people are only interested in preserving their own jobs at all costs. How many cases of the voters changing the direction or attitude of your government can you recall?. I sometimes think that without politics and religion we might find less to fight about, maybe i'm getting cynical in my old age! It is also not generally known that the UK is a non eligible country for the Green Card Lottery as it is known, what price a special relationship. It would seem the although \"Septics and Limeys\" may fight together they should not be allowed to live together. My interest, Ok, Dad was a GI from Pittsburgh, Mom was a UK citizen when i was born in the UK making me British although my mother and both my Sisters became US citizens i did not. US law stated at the time, \"any child born to a serving soldier overseas shall asume the citizenship of the mother\". I would be refused entry to join the US forces and defend that which i have always considered to be my country, i did however serve alongside the US forces as a British soldier. Strange that Old Glory means so much to me but that's the way it's always been....",

I appreciate your point of view and that particular ruling was wrong but I have to disagree that we should so willingly accept individuals joining the armed forces to get their citizenship. In some situations, foreign people make the most ardent and true citizens and soldiers, most are just looking for the easiest way in. I've personally known to many soldiers in solely to get there citizen ship that were a complete detrement to their units. They were not intentionally sabotaging their units but they did not put forth any effort and milked the system at every turn and the rest of us ended up having to do their work or do with out because of their apathy.",
