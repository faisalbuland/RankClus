Our main mission is to attend the funeral services of fallen American heroes as invited guests of the family. Each mission we undertake has two basic objectives: 1. Show our sincere respect for our fallen heroes, their families, and their communities. 2. Shield the mourning family and their friends from interruptions created by any protestor or group of protestors. We accomplish the latter through strictly legal and non-violent means. To those of you who are currently serving and fighting for the freedoms of others, at home and abroad, please know that we are backing you. We honor and support you with every mission we carry out, and we are praying for a safe return home for all. * choose joy each day",

Our main mission is to attend the funeral services of fallen American heroes as invited guests of the family. Each mission we undertake has two basic objectives: 1. Show our sincere respect for our fallen heroes, their families, and their communities. 2. Shield the mourning family and their friends from interruptions created by any protestor or group of protestors. We accomplish the latter through strictly legal and non-violent means. To those of you who are currently serving and fighting for the freedoms of others, at home and abroad, please know that we are backing you. We honor and support you with every mission we carry out, and we are praying for a safe return home for all. * choose joy each day",

But, I only do the missions involving soldiers killed during the current war. A year or so ago, the PGR expanded its mission to include any Veteran's funeral, if the family wants, and with the number of WWII and Korean Vets passing every day, it could easily become a full time job. On any given day here in North Texas, there are 2 or 3 missions pending and I think that's just too much. I really wish they'd go back to their original mission of shielding the family from protestors and honoring those who are dying in combat right now. But, that's just me.",
