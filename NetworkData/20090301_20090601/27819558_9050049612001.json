Please see the full article for context. *** The professional conclusions of Dr. Nathaniel Frank, senior research fellow at the Palm Center, are consistant with the discussion I had regarding the possible impact of, \"non-disclosure,\" on trust, and unit cohesion, with a university professor, a PhD., in the field of Industrial/Organizational Psychology. It appears very clear to me that Dr. Frank is saying that, \"non-disclosure,\" has its own impact on unit cohesion,\" in the negative. *** To me, it would be clear to even a laymen like myself that this whole discussion about, \"disclosure/non-disclosure,\" is really another speaking-out-of-both-sides-of-the-mouth tactic to seek special treatment for a few, toward several negative ends. *** \"Disclosure,\" matters. Even Dr. Miller (please request reference from me) who contributed to inclusive policy initiatives, explains from where the real issue of, \"disclosure,\" comes is, \"GLB,\" fear. What good to the military are service members who live in fear. Keep in mind, Dr. Miller's analysis found the, \"fear,\" in, \"hostile environments,\" not purely in current, \"Federal policy.\" Simply repealing the, \"hostile policy,\" does not eliminate the fear. So again, what good to the military are service members who are allowed to live in fear? *** Just keeping all of this information presented in perspective. The more references I read, the more sense, \"disclosure,\" makes. Dr. Franks comments alone should be a huge an eye-opener for all of us. \u201cBut he should do it armed with the confidence that we now have the research showing that openly gay service doesn't have any negative impact on the military.\" - Dr. Frank *** Great thread IHAWKER! Thanks for the clarifying information! \"",

        "content": "Gay Military Ban Architects Admit Deception California Representative Ellen Tauscher announced she would begin a renewed push to end the 16-year-old ban against gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military on Monday. Dr. Nathaniel Frank, senior research fellow at the Palm Center, joined her in making the announcement. Frank discussed his book on cable television last night where he alleges top military advisors invented their rational for keeping gays quiet in the military. \u201cDon't ask, don't tell\u201d was implemented by Congress in 1993 and signed by President Bill Clinton. The law prescribes discharge as the remedy for gay service members who do not remain quiet about their sexuality or do not remain celibate. President Barack Obama pledged his support for repeal on the campaign trail, but since taking office has only spoken once on the issue. Last month, the Boston Globe quoted Obama saying the administration would wait for a Pentagon assessment on the issue before moving forward. Gay rights activists who have made repeal a top priority were disheartened. \u201cWe do not need another report to tell us what we already know and what earlier reports have long since concluded: The sexual orientation of a service member is irrelevant,\u201d Aubrey Sarvis, president of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a group that advocates for the repeal of the military's gay ban, wrote in a Huffington Post column. \u201cWhat is relevant is how well he or she does the job.\u201d But yesterday, after Tauscher introduced her Military Readiness Enhancement Act, an Obama spokesman sounded a bit more upbeat. \u201c[Obama has] begun consulting closely with Secretary Gates and Chairman Mullen so that this change is done in a sensible way that strengthens our armed forces and national security,\u201d White House Spokesman Tommy Vietor was quoted in The Associated Press. And last night, things got even more interesting when Frank went on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show and said \u201cdon't ask\u201d advisors now admit the policy was a deliberate deception based on no empirical evidence. Frank, author of Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America, told openly lesbian Rachel Maddow that military advisors to Clinton have admitted to the deception. \u201cThey said it was based on nothing,\u201d Frank told Maddow. \u201cIt was rooted in their own prejudices and fears. They even said they didn't know what sexual orientation meant.\u201d \u201cInstead they crated this unit cohesion argument. Which is the idea that openly gay service will somehow undermine unit cohesion and that you have to force service members to lie in order to preserve unit cohesion. Instead of the other way around, that forcing people to lie actually has its own impact on unit cohesion.\u201d Frank agreed with Maddow's statement: \u201cA key advisor to this panel admitted full-stop that the unit cohesion argument was completely made up out of whole cloth.\u201d Frank said he was \u201ccautious\u201d about Obama's announcement to review the law. \u201cOf course military leaders should be consulted,\u201d Frank said. \u201cBut he should do it armed with the confidence that we now have the research showing that openly gay service doesn't have any negative impact on the military. And, in fact, the policy itself is what's causing us to lose soldiers and to force service members to lie to one another. And that's bad for unit cohesion.\u201d Opponents of repeal say open service would \u201csexualize\u201d the military and often portray gay men and women as sexual predators who infiltrate the military to have at its sexual bounty. >http://ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=3371&MediaType=1&Category=26 Imagine that ... \"deception\", who would have thought.",

Frank discussed his book on cable television last night where he alleges top military advisors invented their rational for keeping gays quiet in the military. \u201cDon't ask, don't tell\u201d was implemented by Congress in 1993 and signed by President Bill Clinton. The law prescribes discharge as the remedy for gay service members who do not remain quiet about their sexuality or do not remain celibate. President Barack Obama pledged his support for repeal on the campaign trail, but since taking office has only spoken once on the issue. Last month, the Boston Globe quoted Obama saying the administration would wait for a Pentagon assessment on the issue before moving forward. Gay rights activists who have made repeal a top priority were disheartened. \u201cWe do not need another report to tell us what we already know and what earlier reports have long since concluded: The sexual orientation of a service member is irrelevant,\u201d Aubrey Sarvis, president of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a group that advocates for the repeal of the military's gay ban, wrote in a Huffington Post column. \u201cWhat is relevant is how well he or she does the job.\u201d But yesterday, after Tauscher introduced her Military Readiness Enhancement Act, an Obama spokesman sounded a bit more upbeat. \u201c[Obama has] begun consulting closely with Secretary Gates and Chairman Mullen so that this change is done in a sensible way that strengthens our armed forces and national security,\u201d White House Spokesman Tommy Vietor was quoted in The Associated Press. And last night, things got even more interesting when Frank went on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show and said \u201cdon't ask\u201d advisors now admit the policy was a deliberate deception based on no empirical evidence. Frank, author of Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America, told openly lesbian Rachel Maddow that military advisors to Clinton have admitted to the deception. \u201cThey said it was based on nothing,\u201d Frank told Maddow. \u201cIt was rooted in their own prejudices and fears. They even said they didn't know what sexual orientation meant.\u201d \u201cInstead they crated this unit cohesion argument. Which is the idea that openly gay service will somehow undermine unit cohesion and that you have to force service members to lie in order to preserve unit cohesion. Instead of the other way around, that forcing people to lie actually has its own impact on unit cohesion.\u201d Frank agreed with Maddow's statement: \u201cA key advisor to this panel admitted full-stop that the unit cohesion argument was completely made up out of whole cloth.\u201d Frank said he was \u201ccautious\u201d about Obama's announcement to review the law. \u201cOf course military leaders should be consulted,\u201d Frank said. \u201cBut he should do it armed with the confidence that we now have the research showing that openly gay service doesn't have any negative impact on the military. And, in fact, the policy itself is what's causing us to lose soldiers and to force service members to lie to one another. And that's bad for unit cohesion.\u201d Opponents of repeal say open service would \u201csexualize\u201d the military and often portray gay men and women as sexual predators who infiltrate the military to have at its sexual bounty. >http://ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=3371&MediaType=1&Category=26 Imagine that ... \"deception\", who would have thought.",

These are restrictions that currently exist for gays & lesbians under DA/DT. DADT from The Inside For those of you that think the ban is \u201cworking\u201d and should be left in place this is what DADT looks like from the inside: \u2022 No wedding rings. \u2022 No photos on your desk. \u2022 No thanking your spouse for their support during promotion or award ceremonies. \u2022 They can\u2019t pin on your new rank when you get promoted. \u2022 Any time you go to the same place -- you have to take two cars so no one suspects you\u2019re involved. \u2022 Down in the foxholes, nobody is permitted to warm their hearts over talk about who is waiting at home, you can\u2019t even mention that somebody is waiting for you. \u2022 No hugging or kissing at the airport/pier when you return from deployment, and to avoid suspicion - better if they just don\u2019t show up at all. \u2022 No family information or support group whenever you get deployed. \u2022 If your spouse got into an accident or had to have massive surgery, you could not take family emergency leave to be there for them -- you couldn\u2019t even ask for it because in the eyes of the military: your spouse doesn\u2019t exist. \u2022 No medical care for your spouse, and no spousal information if you need medical care and they want to talk to your doctor. \u2022 No medical power of attorney if you get into an accident and your spouse needs to make decisions about extraordinary measures like whether or not to leave you on the ventilator or take you off. \u2022 If a friend at the office innocently asks if you are seeing anyone, you have to make up a lie. \u2022 If a friend at the office innocently asks if you have any weekend plans, you have to make up a lie. \u2022 Technically speaking, you could have anyone who asks such innocent questions kicked out for violating the \u201cdon\u2019t ask\u201d part. \u2022 If you get drunk and tell anybody that there is anyone other than Uncle Sam \u201cin your life\u201d, whether one-night-stand or legal spouse -- skip the pat on the back and clink of beer bottles, skip the \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d counseling statement, go directly to out-processing because you\u2019re being kicked out of the military for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 If a female service member gets pregnant, she would face immediate discharge because it would quickly become impossible to deny the fact she had sex at least once. \u2022 No medical care or schooling for any children who are born after your initial date of enlistment or commission, you can\u2019t even request it, because that would indicate you had sex with somebody and you would get kicked out for violating Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 Without court documents stating you are the only parent or court ordered child support if you don\u2019t have custody -- you can\u2019t even get dependent benefits for your existing kids, and you can never have full custody of them unless your own parents live within the appropriate radius from base for family emergency evacuation purposes. \u2022 Say goodbye to family housing, because in the eyes of Uncle Sam -- your spouse can\u2019t exist. \u2022 Technically speaking, you can\u2019t even be legally married to anyone because marriage documents are entered into public record -- once the military finds out -- get your bags packed because it is off to the out-processing station for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 Let\u2019s suppose you\u2019re a single soldier, you decide to visit the wrong girl down range from Camp Humphreys, you wind up on sick call for some gift that keeps on giving -- instead of a shot of penicillin and a stern warning -- you get the shot and a DD-214 for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell.

These are restrictions that currently exist for gays & lesbians under DA/DT. DADT from The Inside For those of you that think the ban is \u201cworking\u201d and should be left in place this is what DADT looks like from the inside: \u2022 No wedding rings. \u2022 No photos on your desk. \u2022 No thanking your spouse for their support during promotion or award ceremonies. \u2022 They can\u2019t pin on your new rank when you get promoted. \u2022 Any time you go to the same place -- you have to take two cars so no one suspects you\u2019re involved. \u2022 Down in the foxholes, nobody is permitted to warm their hearts over talk about who is waiting at home, you can\u2019t even mention that somebody is waiting for you. \u2022 No hugging or kissing at the airport/pier when you return from deployment, and to avoid suspicion - better if they just don\u2019t show up at all. \u2022 No family information or support group whenever you get deployed. \u2022 If your spouse got into an accident or had to have massive surgery, you could not take family emergency leave to be there for them -- you couldn\u2019t even ask for it because in the eyes of the military: your spouse doesn\u2019t exist. \u2022 No medical care for your spouse, and no spousal information if you need medical care and they want to talk to your doctor. \u2022 No medical power of attorney if you get into an accident and your spouse needs to make decisions about extraordinary measures like whether or not to leave you on the ventilator or take you off. \u2022 If a friend at the office innocently asks if you are seeing anyone, you have to make up a lie. \u2022 If a friend at the office innocently asks if you have any weekend plans, you have to make up a lie. \u2022 Technically speaking, you could have anyone who asks such innocent questions kicked out for violating the \u201cdon\u2019t ask\u201d part. \u2022 If you get drunk and tell anybody that there is anyone other than Uncle Sam \u201cin your life\u201d, whether one-night-stand or legal spouse -- skip the pat on the back and clink of beer bottles, skip the \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d counseling statement, go directly to out-processing because you\u2019re being kicked out of the military for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 If a female service member gets pregnant, she would face immediate discharge because it would quickly become impossible to deny the fact she had sex at least once. \u2022 No medical care or schooling for any children who are born after your initial date of enlistment or commission, you can\u2019t even request it, because that would indicate you had sex with somebody and you would get kicked out for violating Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 Without court documents stating you are the only parent or court ordered child support if you don\u2019t have custody -- you can\u2019t even get dependent benefits for your existing kids, and you can never have full custody of them unless your own parents live within the appropriate radius from base for family emergency evacuation purposes. \u2022 Say goodbye to family housing, because in the eyes of Uncle Sam -- your spouse can\u2019t exist. \u2022 Technically speaking, you can\u2019t even be legally married to anyone because marriage documents are entered into public record -- once the military finds out -- get your bags packed because it is off to the out-processing station for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 Let\u2019s suppose you\u2019re a single soldier, you decide to visit the wrong girl down range from Camp Humphreys, you wind up on sick call for some gift that keeps on giving -- instead of a shot of penicillin and a stern warning -- you get the shot and a DD-214 for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell.

        "content": "quote: [...] that forcing people to lie actually has its own impact on unit cohesion.\u201d - Quoted from the above article kicking off this thread. Please see the full article for context. *** The professional conclusions of Dr. Nathaniel Frank, senior research fellow at the Palm Center, are consistant with the discussion I had regarding the possible impact of, \"non-disclosure,\" on trust, and unit cohesion, with a university professor, a PhD., in the field of Industrial/Organizational Psychology. It appears very clear to me that Dr. Frank is saying that, \"non-disclosure,\" has its own impact on unit cohesion,\" in the negative. *** To me, it would be clear to even a laymen like myself that this whole discussion about, \"disclosure/non-disclosure,\" is really another speaking-out-of-both-sides-of-the-mouth tactic to seek special treatment for a few, toward several negative ends. *** \"Disclosure,\" matters. Even Dr. Miller (please request reference from me) who contributed to inclusive policy initiatives, explains from where the real issue of, \"disclosure,\" comes is, \"GLB,\" fear. What good to the military are service members who live in fear. Keep in mind, Dr. Miller's analysis found the, \"fear,\" in, \"hostile environments,\" not purely in current, \"Federal policy.\" Simply repealing the, \"hostile policy,\" does not eliminate the fear.

Frank isn't advocating anything close to what you seem to think is necessary. No one need lie and no one need tell and no one need ask. Gay service members should be allowed to serve without any abnormal restrictions, equal opportunity to pursuit of happiness.

Mr Equal just wants to twist this into his logic of making people divulge their sexual orientation so other might avoid having to be in a 'private place' with them.

'Openly gay' does not mean 'confessing' and therefore being segregated into different spaces for the sake moralizing entrepreneurs.

Frank, author of Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America, told openly lesbian Rachel Maddow that military advisors to Clinton have admitted to the deception. \u201cThey said it was based on nothing,\u201d Frank told Maddow. \u201cIt was rooted in their own prejudices and fears. They even said they didn't know what sexual orientation meant.\u201d \u201cInstead they crated this unit cohesion argument. Which is the idea that openly gay service will somehow undermine unit cohesion and that you have to force service members to lie in order to preserve unit cohesion. Instead of the other way around, that forcing people to lie actually has its own impact on unit cohesion.\u201d Based on the above alone, DADT should be made null and void for it is all based on lies and deception. And yet there are those who would like to replace or amend it with more lies and deception!",

These are restrictions that currently exist for gays & lesbians under DA/DT. DADT from The Inside For those of you that think the ban is \u201cworking\u201d and should be left in place this is what DADT looks like from the inside: \u2022 No wedding rings. \u2022 No photos on your desk. \u2022 No thanking your spouse for their support during promotion or award ceremonies. \u2022 They can\u2019t pin on your new rank when you get promoted. \u2022 Any time you go to the same place -- you have to take two cars so no one suspects you\u2019re involved. \u2022 Down in the foxholes, nobody is permitted to warm their hearts over talk about who is waiting at home, you can\u2019t even mention that somebody is waiting for you. \u2022 No hugging or kissing at the airport/pier when you return from deployment, and to avoid suspicion - better if they just don\u2019t show up at all. \u2022 No family information or support group whenever you get deployed. \u2022 If your spouse got into an accident or had to have massive surgery, you could not take family emergency leave to be there for them -- you couldn\u2019t even ask for it because in the eyes of the military: your spouse doesn\u2019t exist. \u2022 No medical care for your spouse, and no spousal information if you need medical care and they want to talk to your doctor. \u2022 No medical power of attorney if you get into an accident and your spouse needs to make decisions about extraordinary measures like whether or not to leave you on the ventilator or take you off. \u2022 If a friend at the office innocently asks if you are seeing anyone, you have to make up a lie. \u2022 If a friend at the office innocently asks if you have any weekend plans, you have to make up a lie. \u2022 Technically speaking, you could have anyone who asks such innocent questions kicked out for violating the \u201cdon\u2019t ask\u201d part. \u2022 If you get drunk and tell anybody that there is anyone other than Uncle Sam \u201cin your life\u201d, whether one-night-stand or legal spouse -- skip the pat on the back and clink of beer bottles, skip the \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d counseling statement, go directly to out-processing because you\u2019re being kicked out of the military for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 If a female service member gets pregnant, she would face immediate discharge because it would quickly become impossible to deny the fact she had sex at least once. \u2022 No medical care or schooling for any children who are born after your initial date of enlistment or commission, you can\u2019t even request it, because that would indicate you had sex with somebody and you would get kicked out for violating Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 Without court documents stating you are the only parent or court ordered child support if you don\u2019t have custody -- you can\u2019t even get dependent benefits for your existing kids, and you can never have full custody of them unless your own parents live within the appropriate radius from base for family emergency evacuation purposes. \u2022 Say goodbye to family housing, because in the eyes of Uncle Sam -- your spouse can\u2019t exist. \u2022 Technically speaking, you can\u2019t even be legally married to anyone because marriage documents are entered into public record -- once the military finds out -- get your bags packed because it is off to the out-processing station for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell. \u2022 Let\u2019s suppose you\u2019re a single soldier, you decide to visit the wrong girl down range from Camp Humphreys, you wind up on sick call for some gift that keeps on giving -- instead of a shot of penicillin and a stern warning -- you get the shot and a DD-214 for violating Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell.
