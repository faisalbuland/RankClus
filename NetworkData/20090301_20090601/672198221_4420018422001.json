WOW you really like using my name. I don't think you should use it for your personal time, but on here I guess it is ok. Just make sure you don't scream it at an inappropriate time, might make one wonder. Anyways, If you had read my post I was referencing conservatives being called pro-assassination. Here I was saying Libs for the antiwar dude who doesn't mind killing post that 6486143 posted. Making a generalized comment against a generalized comment. This guy is not a terrorist and I don't know why everyone keeps saying he is. He is a murderer plain and simple. I don't support terrorism either, that was just a dumbarse comment by you. I am Repub and I'm proud of that fact too. Again, for your leap to a conclusion comment you can read what I already posted.

The POS who did this was probably looking for a cheap thrill and doesn't have two politically-motivated brain cells to rub together. Or any other kind of brain cells, for that matter. Oh, so you find that offensive? But yet on the abortion thread of a dr being killed we can come right out and talk about conservatives being pro-assassination. Maybe you should tell the libs to back off as well. For every thread I see with a dumbarse comment about Repubs I will post one about Libs. Yeah, if someone jumped off a bridge I probably would too, but depends on how deep the water is. Just saying... First, the news is tragic and I hope the shooter (who has been arrested, according to the linked news story) gets the maximum allowable penalty if found guilty in a court of law. However, I scoured the news stories available on the Internet - and I found absolutely no reference to the shooter having a political motive of any kind, leftist or rightist, for the shooting that is known to the police or the reporters who filed the stories. But Anbar7 immediately accuses the shooter of being \"one of those libs\". Wow - Anbar7 should be in intelligence work - he can read minds at a range of hundreds, if not thousands, of miles!!! What an asset Anbar7 would be to the United States!!! It seems Anbar7 is \"offended\" because an Rightist extremist, anti-abortion, militia type has been arrested in Kansas for committing a terrorist act - and Anbar7's is apparently afraid that someone might believe that Anbar7 supports terrorism by Americans on other Americans because Anbar7's politics are to the Right of Center. But why did he leap to this conclusion? When someone goes on the defensive before they are even attacked, it makes you wonder if that person has gone on the defensive because they know deep inside that they deserve to be attacked.", 
        "reply": " WOW you really like using my name. I don't think you should use it for your personal time, but on here I guess it is ok. Just make sure you don't scream it at an inappropriate time, might make one wonder. Anyways, If you had read my post I was referencing conservatives being called pro-assassination. Here I was saying Libs for the antiwar dude who doesn't mind killing post that 6486143 posted. Making a generalized comment against a generalized comment. This guy is not a terrorist and I don't know why everyone keeps saying he is. He is a murderer plain and simple. I don't support terrorism either, that was just a dumbarse comment by you. I am Repub and I'm proud of that fact too. Again, for your leap to a conclusion comment you can read what I already posted.

The POS who did this was probably looking for a cheap thrill and doesn't have two politically-motivated brain cells to rub together. Or any other kind of brain cells, for that matter. Oh, so you find that offensive? But yet on the abortion thread of a dr being killed we can come right out and talk about conservatives being pro-assassination. Maybe you should tell the libs to back off as well. For every thread I see with a dumbarse comment about Repubs I will post one about Libs. Yeah, if someone jumped off a bridge I probably would too, but depends on how deep the water is. Just saying... First, the news is tragic and I hope the shooter (who has been arrested, according to the linked news story) gets the maximum allowable penalty if found guilty in a court of law. However, I scoured the news stories available on the Internet - and I found absolutely no reference to the shooter having a political motive of any kind, leftist or rightist, for the shooting that is known to the police or the reporters who filed the stories. But Anbar7 immediately accuses the shooter of being \"one of those libs\". Wow - Anbar7 should be in intelligence work - he can read minds at a range of hundreds, if not thousands, of miles!!! What an asset Anbar7 would be to the United States!!! It seems Anbar7 is \"offended\" because an Rightist extremist, anti-abortion, militia type has been arrested in Kansas for committing a terrorist act - and Anbar7's is apparently afraid that someone might believe that Anbar7 supports terrorism by Americans on other Americans because Anbar7's politics are to the Right of Center. But why did he leap to this conclusion? When someone goes on the defensive before they are even attacked, it makes you wonder if that person has gone on the defensive because they know deep inside that they deserve to be attacked. WOW you really like using my name. I don't think you should use it for your personal time, but on here I guess it is ok. Just make sure you don't scream it at an inappropriate time, might make one wonder. Anyways, If you had read my post I was referencing conservatives being called pro-assassination. Here I was saying Libs for the antiwar dude who doesn't mind killing post that 6486143 posted. Making a generalized comment against a generalized comment. This guy is not a terrorist and I don't know why everyone keeps saying he is. He is a murderer plain and simple. I don't support terrorism either, that was just a dumbarse comment by you. I am Repub and I'm proud of that fact too. Again, for your leap to a conclusion comment you can read what I already posted.

Oh, so you find that offensive? But yet on the abortion thread of a dr being killed we can come right out and talk about conservatives being pro-assassination. Maybe you should tell the libs to back off as well. For every thread I see with a dumbarse comment about Repubs I will post one about Libs.

WOW you really like using my name. I don't think you should use it for your personal time, but on here I guess it is ok. Just make sure you don't scream it at an inappropriate time, might make one wonder. Anyways, If you had read my post I was referencing conservatives being called pro-assassination. Here I was saying Libs for the antiwar dude who doesn't mind killing post that 6486143 posted. Making a generalized comment against a generalized comment. This guy is not a terrorist and I don't know why everyone keeps saying he is. He is a murderer plain and simple. I don't support terrorism either, that was just a dumbarse comment by you. I am Repub and I'm proud of that fact too. Again, for your leap to a conclusion comment you can read what I already posted.

When someone goes on the defensive before they are even attacked, it makes you wonder if that person has gone on the defensive because they know deep inside that they deserve to be attacked.", 
        "reply": " WOW you really like using my name. I don't think you should use it for your personal time, but on here I guess it is ok. Just make sure you don't scream it at an inappropriate time, might make one wonder. Anyways, If you had read my post I was referencing conservatives being called pro-assassination. Here I was saying Libs for the antiwar dude who doesn't mind killing post that 6486143 posted. Making a generalized comment against a generalized comment. This guy is not a terrorist and I don't know why everyone keeps saying he is. He is a murderer plain and simple. I don't support terrorism either, that was just a dumbarse comment by you. I am Repub and I'm proud of that fact too. Again, for your leap to a conclusion comment you can read what I already posted.

First, the news is tragic and I hope the shooter (who has been arrested, according to the linked news story) gets the maximum allowable penalty if found guilty in a court of law. However, I scoured the news stories available on the Internet - and I found absolutely no reference to the shooter having a political motive of any kind, leftist or rightist, for the shooting that is known to the police or the reporters who filed the stories. But Anbar7 immediately accuses the shooter of being \"one of those libs\". Wow - Anbar7 should be in intelligence work - he can read minds at a range of hundreds, if not thousands, of miles!!! What an asset Anbar7 would be to the United States!!! It seems Anbar7 is \"offended\" because an Rightist extremist, anti-abortion, militia type has been arrested in Kansas for committing a terrorist act - and Anbar7's is apparently afraid that someone might believe that Anbar7 supports terrorism by Americans on other Americans because Anbar7's politics are to the Right of Center. But why did he leap to this conclusion? When someone goes on the defensive before they are even attacked, it makes you wonder if that person has gone on the defensive because they know deep inside that they deserve to be attacked. WOW you really like using my name. I don't think you should use it for your personal time, but on here I guess it is ok. Just make sure you don't scream it at an inappropriate time, might make one wonder. Anyways, If you had read my post I was referencing conservatives being called pro-assassination. Here I was saying Libs for the antiwar dude who doesn't mind killing post that 6486143 posted. Making a generalized comment against a generalized comment. This guy is not a terrorist and I don't know why everyone keeps saying he is. He is a murderer plain and simple. I don't support terrorism either, that was just a dumbarse comment by you. I am Repub and I'm proud of that fact too. Again, for your leap to a conclusion comment you can read what I already posted. Hope you have a good day and remember no using my name for personal use \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

The POS who did this was probably looking for a cheap thrill and doesn't have two politically-motivated brain cells to rub together. Or any other kind of brain cells, for that matter.

First, the news is tragic and I hope the shooter (who has been arrested, according to the linked news story) gets the maximum allowable penalty if found guilty in a court of law.
