IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Sunliner, Agree. After all, they are insurgents, not members of a nation's military in uniform, with issue weapons. The Taliban and other insurgents in Afghanistan, like in Iraq, have weapons from various countries. Not only were those weapons obtained on the battlefield, from stockpiles, etc. but additonally we provided a variety of weapons to the Northern Alliance, to the warlords, and even to al-Qaeda prior to the Taliban assuming power in Afghanistan (at a time when we provided arms to anyone in Afghanistan willing to help throw out the USSR). Surely it should not come as a surprise to the Pakistani military that the insurgents in the Swat Valley and other areas of Pakistan are using some U.S. manufactured weapons. Like the proliferation of Russian AK-47/AK-74's, RPG's, etc.,U.S. manufactured arms are in abundance in that part of the world. Jack",
