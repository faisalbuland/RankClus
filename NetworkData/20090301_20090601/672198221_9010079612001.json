He returned only because Canada refused to allow him to stay any longer. He has a contract with the Army to serve and defend as well as top obey all lawful orders and that includes orders he may not personally agree with. He left his brothers and sisters in harms way byrunning away and now expects to have his right to a fair trial; a right that he failed to protect and his fellow soldiers fought to protect for others. As for being a model soldier.... if a coward is your idea of a model...... then God help this Country.",
