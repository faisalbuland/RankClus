Do you recall anyone saying that the president (it being Bush at the time) should not be criticized in time of war? Walt I don't recall anyone saying that. I found a good example. \"During last night's (4/2/09) \u201cGreat American Panel\u201d segment on Hannity, panelist Layla Kayleigh confronted Sean Hannity on his divisive tactics against President Barack Obama. When he insisted he was only being \u201ccritical,\u201d she noted that when Democrats criticized President Bush, they were called unpatriotic. \u201cNo, they weren't,\u201d Hannity disingenuously said (or else he suffers from amnesia). OK, so maybe they weren't called \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d They were \u201conly\u201d accused of being sick, hating America, undermining the troops and more. With video. The discussion began with Hannity teasingly calling Kayleigh \u201cthe only socialist on the panel,\u201d based on her Obama-supporting comments in the previous segment. Kayleigh objected to the characterization and said, \u201c(Obama) can be wrong. But this atttitude that you have is only going to divide us. We have to come together and find solutions.\u201d \u201cPatriotic\u201d Hannity immediately started whining accusatorily, \u201cI can't be critical or else I will divide the country.\u201d \u201cOf course you can be critical,\u201d Kayleigh began. But Hannity had already directed the panel over to Jesse Lee Peterson, Hannity's favorite bigot. Instead of listening to Kayleigh's concerns, Peterson (supposedly an advocate for personal responsibility) pointed the \u201cliberals did it first with President Bush\u201d finger. \u201cWhen people attacked Bush, they were called unpatriotic,\u201d Kayleigh said. Hannity said resentfully, \u201cNot true. That's not true.\u201d Then he began counting off on his fingers about Democrats, saying, \u201cThey said the surge lost, the war was lost.\u201d You could almost hear him longing to attack Democrats further but couldn't when he had just denied being intolerant. So he moved on, pointing to his pal Peterson. So just to correct the record, here are just a few of the things that have been said about Bush critics on Hannity's show, either by him or by a guest he never rebutted: \"Why don\u2019t you liberals just admit it? You don\u2019t like the military. It\u2019s all phony when you say you support the troops,\" Mark Levin (Hannity calls him \"The Great One\"), 11/2/06 \u201cThe left has a disdain for the military... They\u2019re dangerous... trying to undermine the will of the American people.\" Tom DeLay, 10/31/06 \"It\u2019s clear that the Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry wing of the Democratic Party has a visceral loathing for the American military and for, frankly, America as a country in the world. Their whole approach is to blame us for what, in fact, our enemies do... I think it tells you how deep the sickness is in the left wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d Newt Gingrich, 11/1/06 \"That\u2019s your Party that undermines our troop morale and emboldens our enemies,\" Sean Hannity, 2/1/08. \"When you have Democrats saying it's time to get out, artificial timetables and saying that the Commander-in-Chief lied, distorted, hyped and misled the troops. Is that the thing to do during a time of war?\" Sean Hannity, 12/2/05 By the way, last I checked, this is still a time of war. Or is calling our president a radical socialist better than calling him a liar?\" ------------- These personal attacks are outside what we need to have in order to have a good democractic (small D) discourse in this country. Republicans didn't want Bush criticized in time of war, but they feel it is perfectly okay to attack President Obama is the harshest, most ridiculous terms -- in a time of war. And President Clinton -- What became of the Whitewater investigation? How did proving that Vince Foster was murdered in Hillary's office, or apartment -- how did that ever turn out? These attacks -- the Republican Party stock in trade -- in a time of war, ought to repel good citizens. Good citizens who are engaged and knowledgeable should reject the Republican Party. Is it actually -treason- to call the president a radical socialist? Maybe. It can only give aid and comfort to our enemies. Active Duty and Veterans should have the lead on this. Walt",

Do you recall anyone saying that the president (it being Bush at the time) should not be criticized in time of war? Walt I don't recall anyone saying that. I found a good example. \"During last night's (4/2/09) \u201cGreat American Panel\u201d segment on Hannity, panelist Layla Kayleigh confronted Sean Hannity on his divisive tactics against President Barack Obama. When he insisted he was only being \u201ccritical,\u201d she noted that when Democrats criticized President Bush, they were called unpatriotic. \u201cNo, they weren't,\u201d Hannity disingenuously said (or else he suffers from amnesia). OK, so maybe they weren't called \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d They were \u201conly\u201d accused of being sick, hating America, undermining the troops and more. With video. The discussion began with Hannity teasingly calling Kayleigh \u201cthe only socialist on the panel,\u201d based on her Obama-supporting comments in the previous segment. Kayleigh objected to the characterization and said, \u201c(Obama) can be wrong. But this atttitude that you have is only going to divide us. We have to come together and find solutions.\u201d \u201cPatriotic\u201d Hannity immediately started whining accusatorily, \u201cI can't be critical or else I will divide the country.\u201d \u201cOf course you can be critical,\u201d Kayleigh began. But Hannity had already directed the panel over to Jesse Lee Peterson, Hannity's favorite bigot. Instead of listening to Kayleigh's concerns, Peterson (supposedly an advocate for personal responsibility) pointed the \u201cliberals did it first with President Bush\u201d finger. \u201cWhen people attacked Bush, they were called unpatriotic,\u201d Kayleigh said. Hannity said resentfully, \u201cNot true. That's not true.\u201d Then he began counting off on his fingers about Democrats, saying, \u201cThey said the surge lost, the war was lost.\u201d You could almost hear him longing to attack Democrats further but couldn't when he had just denied being intolerant. So he moved on, pointing to his pal Peterson. So just to correct the record, here are just a few of the things that have been said about Bush critics on Hannity's show, either by him or by a guest he never rebutted: \"Why don\u2019t you liberals just admit it? You don\u2019t like the military. It\u2019s all phony when you say you support the troops,\" Mark Levin (Hannity calls him \"The Great One\"), 11/2/06 \u201cThe left has a disdain for the military... They\u2019re dangerous... trying to undermine the will of the American people.\" Tom DeLay, 10/31/06 \"It\u2019s clear that the Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry wing of the Democratic Party has a visceral loathing for the American military and for, frankly, America as a country in the world. Their whole approach is to blame us for what, in fact, our enemies do... I think it tells you how deep the sickness is in the left wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d Newt Gingrich, 11/1/06 \"That\u2019s your Party that undermines our troop morale and emboldens our enemies,\" Sean Hannity, 2/1/08. \"When you have Democrats saying it's time to get out, artificial timetables and saying that the Commander-in-Chief lied, distorted, hyped and misled the troops. Is that the thing to do during a time of war?\" Sean Hannity, 12/2/05 By the way, last I checked, this is still a time of war. Or is calling our president a radical socialist better than calling him a liar?\" ------------- These personal attacks are outside what we need to have in order to have a good democractic (small D) discourse in this country. Republicans didn't want Bush criticized in time of war, but they feel it is perfectly okay to attack President Obama is the harshest, most ridiculous terms -- in a time of war. And President Clinton -- What became of the Whitewater investigation? How did proving that Vince Foster was murdered in Hillary's office, or apartment -- how did that ever turn out? These attacks -- the Republican Party stock in trade -- in a time of war, ought to repel good citizens. Good citizens who are engaged and knowledgeable should reject the Republican Party. Is it actually -treason- to call the president a radical socialist? Maybe. It can only give aid and comfort to our enemies. Active Duty and Veterans should have the lead on this. Walt",

Republicans didn't want Bush criticized in time of war, but they feel it is perfectly okay to attack President Obama is the harshest, most ridiculous terms -- in a time of war. And President Clinton -- What became of the Whitewater investigation? How did proving that Vince Foster was murdered in Hillary's office, or apartment -- how did that ever turn out? These attacks -- the Republican Party stock in trade -- in a time of war, ought to repel good citizens. Good citizens who are engaged and knowledgeable should reject the Republican Party. Is it actually -treason- to call the president a radical socialist? Maybe. It can only give aid and comfort to our enemies. Active Duty and Veterans should have the lead on this. Walt",

Do you recall anyone saying that the president (it being Bush at the time) should not be criticized in time of war? Walt I don't recall anyone saying that. I found a good example. \"During last night's (4/2/09) \u201cGreat American Panel\u201d segment on Hannity, panelist Layla Kayleigh confronted Sean Hannity on his divisive tactics against President Barack Obama. When he insisted he was only being \u201ccritical,\u201d she noted that when Democrats criticized President Bush, they were called unpatriotic. \u201cNo, they weren't,\u201d Hannity disingenuously said (or else he suffers from amnesia). OK, so maybe they weren't called \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d They were \u201conly\u201d accused of being sick, hating America, undermining the troops and more. With video. The discussion began with Hannity teasingly calling Kayleigh \u201cthe only socialist on the panel,\u201d based on her Obama-supporting comments in the previous segment. Kayleigh objected to the characterization and said, \u201c(Obama) can be wrong. But this atttitude that you have is only going to divide us. We have to come together and find solutions.\u201d \u201cPatriotic\u201d Hannity immediately started whining accusatorily, \u201cI can't be critical or else I will divide the country.\u201d \u201cOf course you can be critical,\u201d Kayleigh began. But Hannity had already directed the panel over to Jesse Lee Peterson, Hannity's favorite bigot. Instead of listening to Kayleigh's concerns, Peterson (supposedly an advocate for personal responsibility) pointed the \u201cliberals did it first with President Bush\u201d finger. \u201cWhen people attacked Bush, they were called unpatriotic,\u201d Kayleigh said. Hannity said resentfully, \u201cNot true. That's not true.\u201d Then he began counting off on his fingers about Democrats, saying, \u201cThey said the surge lost, the war was lost.\u201d You could almost hear him longing to attack Democrats further but couldn't when he had just denied being intolerant. So he moved on, pointing to his pal Peterson. So just to correct the record, here are just a few of the things that have been said about Bush critics on Hannity's show, either by him or by a guest he never rebutted: \"Why don\u2019t you liberals just admit it? You don\u2019t like the military. It\u2019s all phony when you say you support the troops,\" Mark Levin (Hannity calls him \"The Great One\"), 11/2/06 \u201cThe left has a disdain for the military... They\u2019re dangerous... trying to undermine the will of the American people.\" Tom DeLay, 10/31/06 \"It\u2019s clear that the Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry wing of the Democratic Party has a visceral loathing for the American military and for, frankly, America as a country in the world. Their whole approach is to blame us for what, in fact, our enemies do... I think it tells you how deep the sickness is in the left wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d Newt Gingrich, 11/1/06 \"That\u2019s your Party that undermines our troop morale and emboldens our enemies,\" Sean Hannity, 2/1/08. \"When you have Democrats saying it's time to get out, artificial timetables and saying that the Commander-in-Chief lied, distorted, hyped and misled the troops. Is that the thing to do during a time of war?\" Sean Hannity, 12/2/05 By the way, last I checked, this is still a time of war. Or is calling our president a radical socialist better than calling him a liar?\" ------------- These personal attacks are outside what we need to have in order to have a good democractic (small D) discourse in this country. Republicans didn't want Bush criticized in time of war, but they feel it is perfectly okay to attack President Obama is the harshest, most ridiculous terms -- in a time of war. And President Clinton -- What became of the Whitewater investigation? How did proving that Vince Foster was murdered in Hillary's office, or apartment -- how did that ever turn out? These attacks -- the Republican Party stock in trade -- in a time of war, ought to repel good citizens. Good citizens who are engaged and knowledgeable should reject the Republican Party. Is it actually -treason- to call the president a radical socialist? Maybe. It can only give aid and comfort to our enemies. Active Duty and Veterans should have the lead on this. Walt",

Kayleigh objected to the characterization and said, \u201c(Obama) can be wrong. But this atttitude that you have is only going to divide us. We have to come together and find solutions.\u201d \u201cPatriotic\u201d Hannity immediately started whining accusatorily, \u201cI can't be critical or else I will divide the country.\u201d \u201cOf course you can be critical,\u201d Kayleigh began. But Hannity had already directed the panel over to Jesse Lee Peterson, Hannity's favorite bigot. Instead of listening to Kayleigh's concerns, Peterson (supposedly an advocate for personal responsibility) pointed the \u201cliberals did it first with President Bush\u201d finger. \u201cWhen people attacked Bush, they were called unpatriotic,\u201d Kayleigh said. Hannity said resentfully, \u201cNot true. That's not true.\u201d Then he began counting off on his fingers about Democrats, saying, \u201cThey said the surge lost, the war was lost.\u201d You could almost hear him longing to attack Democrats further but couldn't when he had just denied being intolerant. So he moved on, pointing to his pal Peterson. So just to correct the record, here are just a few of the things that have been said about Bush critics on Hannity's show, either by him or by a guest he never rebutted: \"Why don\u2019t you liberals just admit it? You don\u2019t like the military. It\u2019s all phony when you say you support the troops,\" Mark Levin (Hannity calls him \"The Great One\"), 11/2/06 \u201cThe left has a disdain for the military... They\u2019re dangerous... trying to undermine the will of the American people.\" Tom DeLay, 10/31/06 \"It\u2019s clear that the Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry wing of the Democratic Party has a visceral loathing for the American military and for, frankly, America as a country in the world. Their whole approach is to blame us for what, in fact, our enemies do... I think it tells you how deep the sickness is in the left wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d Newt Gingrich, 11/1/06 \"That\u2019s your Party that undermines our troop morale and emboldens our enemies,\" Sean Hannity, 2/1/08. \"When you have Democrats saying it's time to get out, artificial timetables and saying that the Commander-in-Chief lied, distorted, hyped and misled the troops. Is that the thing to do during a time of war?\" Sean Hannity, 12/2/05 By the way, last I checked, this is still a time of war. Or is calling our president a radical socialist better than calling him a liar?\" ------------- These personal attacks are outside what we need to have in order to have a good democractic (small D) discourse in this country. Republicans didn't want Bush criticized in time of war, but they feel it is perfectly okay to attack President Obama is the harshest, most ridiculous terms -- in a time of war. And President Clinton -- What became of the Whitewater investigation? How did proving that Vince Foster was murdered in Hillary's office, or apartment -- how did that ever turn out? These attacks -- the Republican Party stock in trade -- in a time of war, ought to repel good citizens. Good citizens who are engaged and knowledgeable should reject the Republican Party. Is it actually -treason- to call the president a radical socialist? Maybe. It can only give aid and comfort to our enemies. Active Duty and Veterans should have the lead on this. Walt",

Do you recall anyone saying that the president (it being Bush at the time) should not be criticized in time of war? Walt I don't recall anyone saying that. I found a good example. \"During last night's (4/2/09) \u201cGreat American Panel\u201d segment on Hannity, panelist Layla Kayleigh confronted Sean Hannity on his divisive tactics against President Barack Obama. When he insisted he was only being \u201ccritical,\u201d she noted that when Democrats criticized President Bush, they were called unpatriotic. \u201cNo, they weren't,\u201d Hannity disingenuously said (or else he suffers from amnesia). OK, so maybe they weren't called \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d They were \u201conly\u201d accused of being sick, hating America, undermining the troops and more. With video. The discussion began with Hannity teasingly calling Kayleigh \u201cthe only socialist on the panel,\u201d based on her Obama-supporting comments in the previous segment. Kayleigh objected to the characterization and said, \u201c(Obama) can be wrong. But this atttitude that you have is only going to divide us. We have to come together and find solutions.\u201d \u201cPatriotic\u201d Hannity immediately started whining accusatorily, \u201cI can't be critical or else I will divide the country.\u201d \u201cOf course you can be critical,\u201d Kayleigh began. But Hannity had already directed the panel over to Jesse Lee Peterson, Hannity's favorite bigot. Instead of listening to Kayleigh's concerns, Peterson (supposedly an advocate for personal responsibility) pointed the \u201cliberals did it first with President Bush\u201d finger. \u201cWhen people attacked Bush, they were called unpatriotic,\u201d Kayleigh said. Hannity said resentfully, \u201cNot true. That's not true.\u201d Then he began counting off on his fingers about Democrats, saying, \u201cThey said the surge lost, the war was lost.\u201d You could almost hear him longing to attack Democrats further but couldn't when he had just denied being intolerant. So he moved on, pointing to his pal Peterson. So just to correct the record, here are just a few of the things that have been said about Bush critics on Hannity's show, either by him or by a guest he never rebutted: \"Why don\u2019t you liberals just admit it? You don\u2019t like the military. It\u2019s all phony when you say you support the troops,\" Mark Levin (Hannity calls him \"The Great One\"), 11/2/06 \u201cThe left has a disdain for the military...

        "reply": " I found a good example. \"During last night's (4/2/09) \u201cGreat American Panel\u201d segment on Hannity, panelist Layla Kayleigh confronted Sean Hannity on his divisive tactics against President Barack Obama. When he insisted he was only being \u201ccritical,\u201d she noted that when Democrats criticized President Bush, they were called unpatriotic. \u201cNo, they weren't,\u201d Hannity disingenuously said (or else he suffers from amnesia). OK, so maybe they weren't called \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d They were \u201conly\u201d accused of being sick, hating America, undermining the troops and more. With video. The discussion began with Hannity teasingly calling Kayleigh \u201cthe only socialist on the panel,\u201d based on her Obama-supporting comments in the previous segment. Kayleigh objected to the characterization and said, \u201c(Obama) can be wrong. But this atttitude that you have is only going to divide us. We have to come together and find solutions.\u201d \u201cPatriotic\u201d Hannity immediately started whining accusatorily, \u201cI can't be critical or else I will divide the country.\u201d \u201cOf course you can be critical,\u201d Kayleigh began. But Hannity had already directed the panel over to Jesse Lee Peterson, Hannity's favorite bigot. Instead of listening to Kayleigh's concerns, Peterson (supposedly an advocate for personal responsibility) pointed the \u201cliberals did it first with President Bush\u201d finger. \u201cWhen people attacked Bush, they were called unpatriotic,\u201d Kayleigh said. Hannity said resentfully, \u201cNot true. That's not true.\u201d Then he began counting off on his fingers about Democrats, saying, \u201cThey said the surge lost, the war was lost.\u201d You could almost hear him longing to attack Democrats further but couldn't when he had just denied being intolerant. So he moved on, pointing to his pal Peterson. So just to correct the record, here are just a few of the things that have been said about Bush critics on Hannity's show, either by him or by a guest he never rebutted: \"Why don\u2019t you liberals just admit it? You don\u2019t like the military. It\u2019s all phony when you say you support the troops,\" Mark Levin (Hannity calls him \"The Great One\"), 11/2/06 \u201cThe left has a disdain for the military... They\u2019re dangerous... trying to undermine the will of the American people.\" Tom DeLay, 10/31/06 \"It\u2019s clear that the Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry wing of the Democratic Party has a visceral loathing for the American military and for, frankly, America as a country in the world.

I found a good example. \"During last night's (4/2/09) \u201cGreat American Panel\u201d segment on Hannity, panelist Layla Kayleigh confronted Sean Hannity on his divisive tactics against President Barack Obama. When he insisted he was only being \u201ccritical,\u201d she noted that when Democrats criticized President Bush, they were called unpatriotic. \u201cNo, they weren't,\u201d Hannity disingenuously said (or else he suffers from amnesia). OK, so maybe they weren't called \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d They were \u201conly\u201d accused of being sick, hating America, undermining the troops and more. With video. The discussion began with Hannity teasingly calling Kayleigh \u201cthe only socialist on the panel,\u201d based on her Obama-supporting comments in the previous segment. Kayleigh objected to the characterization and said, \u201c(Obama) can be wrong. But this atttitude that you have is only going to divide us. We have to come together and find solutions.\u201d \u201cPatriotic\u201d Hannity immediately started whining accusatorily, \u201cI can't be critical or else I will divide the country.\u201d \u201cOf course you can be critical,\u201d Kayleigh began. But Hannity had already directed the panel over to Jesse Lee Peterson, Hannity's favorite bigot. Instead of listening to Kayleigh's concerns, Peterson (supposedly an advocate for personal responsibility) pointed the \u201cliberals did it first with President Bush\u201d finger. \u201cWhen people attacked Bush, they were called unpatriotic,\u201d Kayleigh said. Hannity said resentfully, \u201cNot true. That's not true.\u201d Then he began counting off on his fingers about Democrats, saying, \u201cThey said the surge lost, the war was lost.\u201d You could almost hear him longing to attack Democrats further but couldn't when he had just denied being intolerant. So he moved on, pointing to his pal Peterson. So just to correct the record, here are just a few of the things that have been said about Bush critics on Hannity's show, either by him or by a guest he never rebutted: \"Why don\u2019t you liberals just admit it? You don\u2019t like the military. It\u2019s all phony when you say you support the troops,\" Mark Levin (Hannity calls him \"The Great One\"), 11/2/06 \u201cThe left has a disdain for the military... They\u2019re dangerous... trying to undermine the will of the American people.\" Tom DeLay, 10/31/06 \"It\u2019s clear that the Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry wing of the Democratic Party has a visceral loathing for the American military and for, frankly, America as a country in the world. Their whole approach is to blame us for what, in fact, our enemies do... I think it tells you how deep the sickness is in the left wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d Newt Gingrich, 11/1/06 \"That\u2019s your Party that undermines our troop morale and emboldens our enemies,\" Sean Hannity, 2/1/08. \"When you have Democrats saying it's time to get out, artificial timetables and saying that the Commander-in-Chief lied, distorted, hyped and misled the troops. Is that the thing to do during a time of war?\" Sean Hannity, 12/2/05 By the way, last I checked, this is still a time of war. Or is calling our president a radical socialist better than calling him a liar?\" ------------- These personal attacks are outside what we need to have in order to have a good democractic (small D) discourse in this country. Republicans didn't want Bush criticized in time of war, but they feel it is perfectly okay to attack President Obama is the harshest, most ridiculous terms -- in a time of war. And President Clinton -- What became of the Whitewater investigation? How did proving that Vince Foster was murdered in Hillary's office, or apartment -- how did that ever turn out? These attacks -- the Republican Party stock in trade -- in a time of war, ought to repel good citizens. Good citizens who are engaged and knowledgeable should reject the Republican Party. Is it actually -treason- to call the president a radical socialist? Maybe. It can only give aid and comfort to our enemies. Active Duty and Veterans should have the lead on this. Walt",
