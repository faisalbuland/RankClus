But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble). quote: My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites). Just as important, we need to ensure that no new mistakes are made in the process of moving forward \u2014 a real danger right now. Ali Soufan was an F.B.I. supervisory special agent from 1997 to 2005. \"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html?_r=2&ref=opinion\" One of the oddest things about this ongoing defense, is that it turns out that this was outsourced to private contractors.

        "quote": "Originally posted by jdksfcret: ABC News: Whoops, Our Story Sanitizing Torture Was All Wrong ABC News has quietly acknowledged that they screwed up in airing a now-discredited 2007 story reporting that a top terror suspect swiftly broke under minimal waterboarding, a tale that was widely picked up at the time, sanitizing and shaping the subsequent torture debate and boosting the claim that it works. The network\u2019s concession is not a stand-alone correction \u2014 it appears in a news story that focuses largely on something else: The CIA\u2019s use of private contractors to design the torture program. The original 2007 story aired former CIA officer John Kiriakou\u2019s unverified and second-hand claims that suspected terrorist Abu Zubaydah broke after being waterboarded for \u201cprobably 30, 35 seconds.\u201d The story was suddenly the focus of renewed attention when The New York Times ran a big story earlier this week pointing out that the extensive waterboarding detailed in the torture memos sharply contradicted ABC\u2019s widely-cited tale. ABC News\u2019 correction appears almost in passing in the network\u2019s new story. It mentions that the new memos show that waterboarding was used far more often than originally thought, adding that Zubaydah was waterboarded \u201cat least 83 times.\u201d It continues: That contradicts what former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who led the Zubaydah capture team, told ABC News in 2007 when he first revealed publicly that waterboarding had been used.

        "content": "Well the threads on this board are full of stories about the effectiveness of torture. Heck we have \"real quotes\" from experts in the field. We know for example that it was only thorugh the use of torture that we have arrested KSM, and a half dozed other notables. Well, the truth is getting out there despite all this bogus bravo sierra, which so many believe simply because it appeals to that good old spirit of revenge. But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble). quote: My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites). Just as important, we need to ensure that no new mistakes are made in the process of moving forward \u2014 a real danger right now. Ali Soufan was an F.B.I. supervisory special agent from 1997 to 2005. \"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html?_r=2&ref=opinion\" One of the oddest things about this ongoing defense, is that it turns out that this was outsourced to private contractors. Can you imagine? Some guy goes over the the adolescents in the Bush Administration, as just as he's putting down his latest GI Joe comic book, tells them that HE can guarranttee results - None of this liberal crap about reliable and actionable intelligence. So now KSM has admitted personally cutting off Daniel Pearls head. A crime he couldn't possibly have commited. And if we asked him, who killed Mother Teresa, he'll confess to that as well. In fact, all you have to do is name a crime, and he confesses. That's what I call the real stuff here. Dave",

Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites). Just as important, we need to ensure that no new mistakes are made in the process of moving forward \u2014 a real danger right now.

        "reply": "Well the threads on this board are full of stories about the effectiveness of torture. Heck we have \"real quotes\" from experts in the field. We know for example that it was only thorugh the use of torture that we have arrested KSM, and a half dozed other notables. Well, the truth is getting out there despite all this bogus bravo sierra, which so many believe simply because it appeals to that good old spirit of revenge. But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble).  One of the oddest things about this ongoing defense, is that it turns out that this was outsourced to private contractors. Can you imagine? Some guy goes over the the adolescents in the Bush Administration, as just as he's putting down his latest GI Joe comic book, tells them that HE can guarranttee results - None of this liberal crap about reliable and actionable intelligence. So now KSM has admitted personally cutting off Daniel Pearls head. A crime he couldn't possibly have commited. And if we asked him, who killed Mother Teresa, he'll confess to that as well. In fact, all you have to do is name a crime, and he confesses. That's what I call the real stuff here. Dave",

But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble). quote: My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites).

The network\u2019s concession is not a stand-alone correction \u2014 it appears in a news story that focuses largely on something else: The CIA\u2019s use of private contractors to design the torture program. The original 2007 story aired former CIA officer John Kiriakou\u2019s unverified and second-hand claims that suspected terrorist Abu Zubaydah broke after being waterboarded for \u201cprobably 30, 35 seconds.\u201d The story was suddenly the focus of renewed attention when The New York Times ran a big story earlier this week pointing out that the extensive waterboarding detailed in the torture memos sharply contradicted ABC\u2019s widely-cited tale. ABC News\u2019 correction appears almost in passing in the network\u2019s new story. It mentions that the new memos show that waterboarding was used far more often than originally thought, adding that Zubaydah was waterboarded \u201cat least 83 times.\u201d It continues: That contradicts what former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who led the Zubaydah capture team, told ABC News in 2007 when he first revealed publicly that waterboarding had been used. ABC doesn\u2019t mention the huge role played by original story in shaping the subsequent debate, and to my knowledge the network hasn\u2019t said it regrets the error.

We know for example that it was only thorugh the use of torture that we have arrested KSM, and a half dozed other notables. Well, the truth is getting out there despite all this bogus bravo sierra, which so many believe simply because it appeals to that good old spirit of revenge. But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble). quote: My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites). Just as important, we need to ensure that no new mistakes are made in the process of moving forward \u2014 a real danger right now.

The network\u2019s concession is not a stand-alone correction \u2014 it appears in a news story that focuses largely on something else: The CIA\u2019s use of private contractors to design the torture program. The original 2007 story aired former CIA officer John Kiriakou\u2019s unverified and second-hand claims that suspected terrorist Abu Zubaydah broke after being waterboarded for \u201cprobably 30, 35 seconds.\u201d The story was suddenly the focus of renewed attention when The New York Times ran a big story earlier this week pointing out that the extensive waterboarding detailed in the torture memos sharply contradicted ABC\u2019s widely-cited tale. ABC News\u2019 correction appears almost in passing in the network\u2019s new story. It mentions that the new memos show that waterboarding was used far more often than originally thought, adding that Zubaydah was waterboarded \u201cat least 83 times.\u201d It continues: That contradicts what former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who led the Zubaydah capture team, told ABC News in 2007 when he first revealed publicly that waterboarding had been used. ABC doesn\u2019t mention the huge role played by original story in shaping the subsequent debate, and to my knowledge the network hasn\u2019t said it regrets the error. While it\u2019s good that ABC corrected the record, the damage of the original story has long since been done. http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/torture/abc-news-whoops-our-story-sanitizing-torture-was-all-wrong/",

A normal person, unlike a wingnut, would simply say, that if it wasn't TRUE, the FBI would issue a public statement denying it. A normal person would expect to hear FBI agents publicly denouncing him as a liar. But a wingnut, like yourself can only repeat the incredible Anti-American statements that telling the truth is dishonorable, and therefore it's ok to slander anyone who reveals the truth. The above sounds more like the logic of Stalin then that of an American. Dave",

Well, the truth is getting out there despite all this bogus bravo sierra, which so many believe simply because it appeals to that good old spirit of revenge. But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble). quote: My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites). Just as important, we need to ensure that no new mistakes are made in the process of moving forward \u2014 a real danger right now.

        "content": "Well the threads on this board are full of stories about the effectiveness of torture. Heck we have \"real quotes\" from experts in the field. We know for example that it was only thorugh the use of torture that we have arrested KSM, and a half dozed other notables. Well, the truth is getting out there despite all this bogus bravo sierra, which so many believe simply because it appeals to that good old spirit of revenge. But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble). quote: My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites).

        "quote": "My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May.

        "content": "Well the threads on this board are full of stories about the effectiveness of torture. Heck we have \"real quotes\" from experts in the field. We know for example that it was only thorugh the use of torture that we have arrested KSM, and a half dozed other notables. Well, the truth is getting out there despite all this bogus bravo sierra, which so many believe simply because it appeals to that good old spirit of revenge. But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble). quote: My Tortured Decision By ALI SOUFAN Published: April 22, 2009 FOR seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. I have spoken only in closed government hearings, as these matters were classified. But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story, and on some of the lessons to be learned. One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based. The first, dated August 2002, grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high-ranking terrorist, Abu Zubaydah, on the grounds that previous methods hadn\u2019t been working. The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use. It is inaccurate, however, to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative. Along with another F.B.I. agent, and with several C.I.A. officers present, I questioned him from March to June 2002, before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August. Under traditional interrogation methods, he provided us with important actionable intelligence. We discovered, for example, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber. This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career: traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives, uncovering plots and saving lives. There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t have been, gained from regular tactics. In addition, I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions \u2014 all of which are still classified. The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process. Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mr. Padilla. This is false. The information that led to Mr. Shibh\u2019s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods. As for Mr. Padilla, the dates just don\u2019t add up: the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002, Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May. One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so-called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I., similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks. Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques, our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation. An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him. It was the right decision to release these memos, as we need the truth to come out. This should not be a partisan matter, because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world\u2019s foremost defenders of human rights. Just as important, releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice. The debate after the release of these memos has centered on whether C.I.A. officials should be prosecuted for their role in harsh interrogation techniques. That would be a mistake. Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques: it is un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security. Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites). Just as important, we need to ensure that no new mistakes are made in the process of moving forward \u2014 a real danger right now. Ali Soufan was an F.B.I. supervisory special agent from 1997 to 2005. \"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html?_r=2&ref=opinion\" One of the oddest things about this ongoing defense, is that it turns out that this was outsourced to private contractors. Can you imagine? Some guy goes over the the adolescents in the Bush Administration, as just as he's putting down his latest GI Joe comic book, tells them that HE can guarranttee results - None of this liberal crap about reliable and actionable intelligence. So now KSM has admitted personally cutting off Daniel Pearls head. A crime he couldn't possibly have commited. And if we asked him, who killed Mother Teresa, he'll confess to that as well. In fact, all you have to do is name a crime, and he confesses. That's what I call the real stuff here. Dave",

Fortunately for me, after I objected to the enhanced techniques, the message came through from Pat D\u2019Amuro, an F.B.I. assistant director, that \u201cwe don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I was pulled out of the interrogations by the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller (this was documented in the report released last year by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general). My C.I.A. colleagues who balked at the techniques, on the other hand, were instructed to continue. (It\u2019s worth noting that when reading between the lines of the newly released memos, it seems clear that it was contractors, not C.I.A. officers, who requested the use of these techniques.) As we move forward, it\u2019s important to not allow the torture issue to harm the reputation, and thus the effectiveness, of the C.I.A. The agency is essential to our national security. We must ensure that the mistakes behind the use of these techniques are never repeated. We\u2019re making a good start: President Obama has limited interrogation techniques to the guidelines set in the Army Field Manual, and Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, says he has banned the use of contractors and secret overseas prisons for terrorism suspects (the so-called black sites). Just as important, we need to ensure that no new mistakes are made in the process of moving forward \u2014 a real danger right now. Ali Soufan was an F.B.I. supervisory special agent from 1997 to 2005. \"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html?_r=2&ref=opinion\"", 
        "reply": "Well the threads on this board are full of stories about the effectiveness of torture. Heck we have \"real quotes\" from experts in the field. We know for example that it was only thorugh the use of torture that we have arrested KSM, and a half dozed other notables. Well, the truth is getting out there despite all this bogus bravo sierra, which so many believe simply because it appeals to that good old spirit of revenge. But what about a guy who actually interogated Al Qaeda big wigs? (Of course he must be a liberal. In the new America, \"Liberal\" is defined as anyone who pops the Party line bubble).  One of the oddest things about this ongoing defense, is that it turns out that this was outsourced to private contractors. Can you imagine? Some guy goes over the the adolescents in the Bush Administration, as just as he's putting down his latest GI Joe comic book, tells them that HE can guarranttee results - None of this liberal crap about reliable and actionable intelligence. So now KSM has admitted personally cutting off Daniel Pearls head. A crime he couldn't possibly have commited. And if we asked him, who killed Mother Teresa, he'll confess to that as well. In fact, all you have to do is name a crime, and he confesses. That's what I call the real stuff here. Dave",

Gosh Flanker, a wiki link? You mean he didn't head the Cole investigation? Flanker, it's a summary of the career of an American Hero who got awesome results. A normal person, unlike a wingnut, would simply say, that if it wasn't TRUE, the FBI would issue a public statement denying it. A normal person would expect to hear FBI agents publicly denouncing him as a liar. But a wingnut, like yourself can only repeat the incredible Anti-American statements that telling the truth is dishonorable, and therefore it's ok to slander anyone who reveals the truth. The above sounds more like the logic of Stalin then that of an American. Dave",
