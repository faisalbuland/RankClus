        "content": "To Whom It May Concern: My name is Rhonda Singleton and I am the widow of Woodrow Singleton an E-7 that served in the United States Army for twenty-one years. While on active duty my husband contributed in combat in Haiti and Bosnia. Upon his return to conus duty assignment my husband trained troops under his supervision making every effort to produce the next generation of soldiers that would serve and protect the United States and serve the army proud. We enjoyed life as a military family until May of 2003 when my husband\u2019s health began to decline due to a service connected disability. He was admitted to Walter Reid Army medical center where he was diagnosed with sarcoma of the leg. He remained an out patient receiving chemo therapy for nine months and was later released for treatment in the Fort Bragg N.C. area where his family resided. He died on December 07, 2004 leaving behind a wife and two young children. The SGLI benefit awarded my family 250,000 withholding the retroactive death benefit of an additional 150,000 dollars as stated in Article H.R.1815-181 and H.R. 1815-182 section 664 paragraph D 2 & 3. Under this article soldiers who where not in war time situations when illness, injuries or death occurred are not awarded this sum. I speak for myself and the other 176 documented cases of families that were shorted, when I say it is unfair. The dates written in this article put limitations on the service validity of the soldiers that served their country. Although my husband and others may not have served and died in the current war, they did die in service to their country. Where they died should not be the deciding factor in weather their families receive the full benefits allowed. I believe this article should be amended to include soldiers who die within one year of retirement as a result of a service connected illness or injury. It would greatly benefit the families these soldiers leave behind. Sincerely, Mrs. Rhonda Singleton",
