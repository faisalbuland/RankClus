Cheney had asked the agency to declassify two memos that he believes back up his contention that useful intelligence was gained through such methods. The Bush administration authorized the use of waterboarding, sleep and food deprivation and forced nudity as it sought information after the Sept. 11 attacks. The CIA said the two memos Cheney asked to be made public were relevant to pending litigation. \"For that reason -- and that reason only -- CIA did not accept Mr. Cheney's request for a Mandatory Declassification Review,\" Paul Gimigliano, CIA spokesman, said. The interesting thing is that the memos that President Obama already released are part of the same \"pending litigation\". If those memos could be released, why not the ones that Cheney is requesting?",

I believe these and a whole pile of other memo's will ultimately be released. The Republican strategy to tar the Democrats with torture, and/or torture works, is going to back fire BIG TIME. They have created tremendous presure on Obama to vindicate the Democrats. Up till now he's been calmly trying to bury the question. Pretty soon he's going to have to cave to the very storm that the Republicans have created. Watch and see - I give it two months tops, and all these memo's will be released. Keep in mind that the memo's that Obama has already released were actually released years ago under the FOIA. These were simply more complete versions of what we already knew. Dave",
