The suspects \u2014 two Germans and two Turkish nationals \u2014 were all arrested in 2007. They face charges including membership in a terrorist organization and conspiracy to commit murder. \"The defendants were driven by the will to destroy the enemies of Islam \u2014 particularly U.S. citizens \u2014 in Germany and to reach the scale of the Sept. 11 attacks,\" prosecutor Volker Brinkmann said as he presented the charges at the Duesseldorf state court. The four were moved by \"profound hatred of the U.S.A. as the greatest enemy of Islam,\" said another prosecutor, Ralf Setton, adding that German victims also would have been \"welcome\" to them. He said they aimed to kill \"as many people as possible.\" Related links Photo Prosecutors allege that the group planned car bomb attacks on sites such as pubs, discos and airports, and considered targets in cities including Frankfurt, Dortmund, Duesseldorf, Cologne, Stuttgart, Munich and Ramstein \u2014 where the U.S. military has a large air base. They maintain the attacks were to be carried out before an October 2007 vote by the German parliament on extending German troops' stay in Afghanistan. German authorities arrested three of the men, alleged ringleader Fritz Gelowicz, 29; Daniel Schneider, 23; and Adem Yilmaz, 30, at a rented cottage in central Germany on Sept. 4, 2007. Turkey picked up the fourth, 24-year-old Attila Selek, in Turkey in November 2007 and later extradited to Germany. Gelowicz and Schneider are both Germans who converted to Islam. All the suspects are accused of being members of the radical Islamic Jihad Union, an offshoot of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. According to the U.S. State Department, the Islamic Jihad Union was responsible for coordinated bombings outside the U.S. and Israeli embassies in July 2004 in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent. Members have been trained in explosives by al-Qaida instructors, and the group has ties to Osama bin Laden and fugitive Taliban leader Mullah Omar, according to the State Department.\" Given the fact that no torture was involved bringing these men to trial..I would say that's a pretty good indication that we do not have to torture, to get information to arrest and bring to trial these criminals. Intel did it's job. \"http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-eu-germany-terror-trial,0,2316159.story\"",

Should we just pretend that the techniques are not part of SERE training so they can engage in partisan witch-hunts against people associated with the GW Bush administration? Should we act as though this fact is a closely-guarded secret vital to national security even after The One, in all \"H\"is infinite wisdom, has provided the entire world with details of exactly what enhanced interrogation techniques were used on Islamic terrorists who were responsible for 9/11? Gimme a damn break. Besides which, the fact that waterboarding etc are used to train troops in SERE school is not exactly news, I am not the first one to bring this up.", 
        "reply": " Have you been to SERE school? I have, but I am not going to discuss what happens there on an open forum. When I was in high school I did almost drown, and that was certainly the scariest moment in my life. I have no doubt that drowning someone is torture, and there is no such think as \"simulated drowning\". It is all a matter of how long you do it and if you stop before the person dies.",

The suspects \u2014 two Germans and two Turkish nationals \u2014 were all arrested in 2007. They face charges including membership in a terrorist organization and conspiracy to commit murder. \"The defendants were driven by the will to destroy the enemies of Islam \u2014 particularly U.S. citizens \u2014 in Germany and to reach the scale of the Sept. 11 attacks,\" prosecutor Volker Brinkmann said as he presented the charges at the Duesseldorf state court. The four were moved by \"profound hatred of the U.S.A. as the greatest enemy of Islam,\" said another prosecutor, Ralf Setton, adding that German victims also would have been \"welcome\" to them. He said they aimed to kill \"as many people as possible.\" Related links Photo Prosecutors allege that the group planned car bomb attacks on sites such as pubs, discos and airports, and considered targets in cities including Frankfurt, Dortmund, Duesseldorf, Cologne, Stuttgart, Munich and Ramstein \u2014 where the U.S. military has a large air base. They maintain the attacks were to be carried out before an October 2007 vote by the German parliament on extending German troops' stay in Afghanistan. German authorities arrested three of the men, alleged ringleader Fritz Gelowicz, 29; Daniel Schneider, 23; and Adem Yilmaz, 30, at a rented cottage in central Germany on Sept. 4, 2007. Turkey picked up the fourth, 24-year-old Attila Selek, in Turkey in November 2007 and later extradited to Germany. Gelowicz and Schneider are both Germans who converted to Islam. All the suspects are accused of being members of the radical Islamic Jihad Union, an offshoot of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. According to the U.S. State Department, the Islamic Jihad Union was responsible for coordinated bombings outside the U.S. and Israeli embassies in July 2004 in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent. Members have been trained in explosives by al-Qaida instructors, and the group has ties to Osama bin Laden and fugitive Taliban leader Mullah Omar, according to the State Department.\" Given the fact that no torture was involved bringing these men to trial..I would say that's a pretty good indication that we do not have to torture, to get information to arrest and bring to trial these criminals.

The suspects \u2014 two Germans and two Turkish nationals \u2014 were all arrested in 2007. They face charges including membership in a terrorist organization and conspiracy to commit murder. \"The defendants were driven by the will to destroy the enemies of Islam \u2014 particularly U.S. citizens \u2014 in Germany and to reach the scale of the Sept. 11 attacks,\" prosecutor Volker Brinkmann said as he presented the charges at the Duesseldorf state court. The four were moved by \"profound hatred of the U.S.A. as the greatest enemy of Islam,\" said another prosecutor, Ralf Setton, adding that German victims also would have been \"welcome\" to them. He said they aimed to kill \"as many people as possible.\" Related links Photo Prosecutors allege that the group planned car bomb attacks on sites such as pubs, discos and airports, and considered targets in cities including Frankfurt, Dortmund, Duesseldorf, Cologne, Stuttgart, Munich and Ramstein \u2014 where the U.S. military has a large air base. They maintain the attacks were to be carried out before an October 2007 vote by the German parliament on extending German troops' stay in Afghanistan. German authorities arrested three of the men, alleged ringleader Fritz Gelowicz, 29; Daniel Schneider, 23; and Adem Yilmaz, 30, at a rented cottage in central Germany on Sept. 4, 2007. Turkey picked up the fourth, 24-year-old Attila Selek, in Turkey in November 2007 and later extradited to Germany. Gelowicz and Schneider are both Germans who converted to Islam. All the suspects are accused of being members of the radical Islamic Jihad Union, an offshoot of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

To be fair they hear about torture and equate it to the Saddam or insurgent style torture where people are killed with power drills or other much more vicious types. However the whole debate made us look bad to them, and even worse the perception that we would torture captives just makes it that much more difficult to fight COIN warfare. The perception that we would use torture influences people to join or support the insurgents, because we are seen as an evil occupying force. I would go so far as to say our use of waterboarding has cost many more lives than it has ever saved just by the ability of groups like Al Qaeda or the Mahdi Army to exploit it for their own recruiting. Waterboarding may even produce certain valuble intelligence, but that is unlikely. To have used it 183 times on one person just shows that it is ineffective.",
