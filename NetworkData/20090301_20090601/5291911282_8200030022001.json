We have a four year old daughter, we just fought out that we cannot utilize the school or childcare developments because we don't live on base. (First let down)Child is so expensive (100.00 weekly or more). Previous she was in a headstart program back home. I was told no need to apply for supplement to help pay because we make too much (my husband is only E3, but too much I guess, second let down). Help I need someone with new ideas, recommendations, please someone point me in the right direction, if there any hope. I don't want to get a job just to pay childcare. Help..........",

We just did without a lot of things, I mean a lot of things. When I was deployed to Vietnam, we could leave our family in quarters. So we moved them to Independence MO and our daughter started school a year late. But it all worked out well for her and us. She is now an E9 in the Coast Guard with 27 years. Their daughters are both college graduates - one just joined the USCG Reserves and the other one is in AF Basic at Lackland AFB. Please keep us posted, so that we can rejoice with you and we may be able to help the nest person who comes our way.

Have you been to any of the Mother's Meetings on base yet? You should start networking, and ask for recommendations for women who watch kids in their own homes, some kind of a set up where they are not just watching TV all day (you run that risk with regular day care too!) There's most likely someone offering in-home care for a more reasonable price than you've been quoted. That's probably your best choice for now.",
