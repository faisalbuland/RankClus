PS When I was a kid late 60's earily 70's a man living nearby would tie out his dog when she was in heat and put out baited trap around her. When a dog would get caught in a trap he would shoot it with a pellet gun over and over to inflict pain and several dog died (or had to be put down by the owners) because of the damage done by the trap the pellets or both.
