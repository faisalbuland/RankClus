The disease has already reached Texas and California, and with 24 new suspected cases reported Saturday in Mexico City alone, schools were closed and all public events suspended in the capital until further notice \u2014 including more than 500 concerts and other gatherings in the metropolis of 20 million.

None of them were hospitalised, none of them were in a life threatening situation. Very puzzling and I doubt if we will know any answers for weeks if not months. Oh, I dont know....could it be the high quality private medical that millions of people use in the USA. You know proper immunizations and routine medical care, better hygiene, kids and adults in the US have access to better than government run healthcare. The local hospital that first had contact with Geraldo Leyva Lolis, one of the first victims of this flu strain, didnt even have anti-virals or a means to even test him. But hey, Under Obama's grand plan, that kind of superb government run health care is coming your way to the USA.",

In a few months we will hear that the only way to combat this disease will have all hospitals work together, share patient information, demographics, drugs etc. The only way to do this is to unite the healthcare system under one \"command\"...
