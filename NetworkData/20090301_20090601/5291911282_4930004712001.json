Now they are talking about medically discharging her on the grounds that she may have Crohn's Disease. If she is discharged will she retain any type of benefits? Will she only be paid for the 2 weeks or will she still qualify for her sign-on bonus?",

I was in reserves for 18 years and I had no military benefits except for those times.... Crohn's I believe is treatable so I do not see where your daughter could not continue with a reserve/guard obligation but I suspect that she will have to have treatment first and then doctors memo stating to the effect that she can participate.... good luck. But there are more informed individuals then I on these forums. One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",
