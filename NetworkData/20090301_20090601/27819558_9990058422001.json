Will Pass Marriage-Equality Bill June 01, 2009 On the first day of Gay Pride month, New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn made perhaps the most emphatic statements to date from a public official that the New York state legislature would pass marriage-equality legislation before the end of June. \u201cThis is a very big thing that I believe is going to happen this month,\u201d said Quinn, while cautioning, \u201cthe next 20-plus days are going to be nerve-wracking.\u201d Quinn addressed a forum presented by the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association at the headquarters of WNYC-FM, where she expanded on the optimism she expressed yesterday in an interview with CNN\u2019s John King. The out lesbian leader of the city council has in the past month emerged as a leading voice in the effort to lobby the closely divided state senate to pass the bill. The Democratic-controlled assembly approved the legislation on May 12, and Gov. David Paterson is eager to sign it. Quinn, who has lobbied state lawmakers behind closed doors in Albany in recent weeks, described \u201clong\u201d and \u201crespectful\u201d conversations, often involving religion, with Republicans who are struggling to come to terms with same-sex marriage. Democrats hold a slim 32-30 majority in the senate, and several Democrats have voiced opposition to the bill, making bipartisan support crucial. more at >>>http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid87547.asp",
