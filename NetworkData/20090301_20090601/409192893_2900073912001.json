Things sound kind of scary over there with neo-nazis and gangs on the streets. Since you live there, your opinion would be appreciated. I have always wanted to see the National Museum in Moscow, and Red Square/Kremlin.

I will definitely stay in touch with you skytail. At this point and time, I've no idea when I can travel over there. I don't like venturing into foreign countries alone.
