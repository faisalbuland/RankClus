It is so convoluted and confusing that the next liberal media hound that takes a picture will find themselves sued by the family of one of the deceased that didn't give their permission. It will only take one or two photos then America will be bored. The deceased is usually only at Dover for 72 hours, how quick can a paparazzi get permission from the right family then be there to take only the picture of THAT one? Too much work for the lazy, too much risk of litigation for any magazine or paper buying and publishing the picture. I think one or two pictures followed by a few law suits and this will be a done deal. The way to control the media is with money not laws. Early in this nation\u2019s history we used to be able to Tar and feather paparazzi, wish we could do it now; that would make sure of truth in journalism.",
