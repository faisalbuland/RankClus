[34] Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: [35] For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: [36] Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

David Pinckney's cellphone kept ringing, the pastor took a break and sat down for lunch in the kitchen of his home with his new friend, convicted child killer Raymond Guay. The two men hardly knew each other a week ago. But since Friday, when Pinckney invited Guay, recently paroled, to live with him and his family of five children, the two men's lives have become intertwined. In recent days, both have become pariahs in this tiny, rural New Hampshire community in the hills outside Concord - Pinckney because of his act of kindness and Guay because of his act of evil. Some locals don't claim to understand either, and many want to run Guay out of town. Fear is rampant and growing. Many children here are no longer allowed to play outside. Pinckney said he has received more than one threatening phone call from angry people. \"No Kid Killers,\" says one sign in town, hanging off the side of a parked pickup truck. And people have appealed to elected officials as well. In a town meeting this week, more than 200 people gathered to ask that Guay go somewhere else. But forcing someone to leave isn't exactly easy, or legal. By order of a federal judge, Guay, 60, is supposed to remain in New Hampshire to serve three years of parole. And Pinckney, inviting a reporter into his home for the first time yesterday on the condition that no questions be asked of Guay, made it clear that, protests or not, he and his family are not backing down from their decision to allow Guay to live with them. In fact, on the contrary, Pinckney said, Guay is becoming a beloved house guest. The tall, lanky man with a narrow face and bushy gray beard is making himself useful around the house, helping the Pinckney family to complete an addition above the garage... Convinced that Guay is a changed man - a convert and devoted Christian - Pinckney decided to take the ex-convict into his home for the next two months. And so the *****ly problem of Raymond Guay came to tiny Chichester, population 2,400. \"We were warned,\" said Pinckney, who has four children, ages 13 to 18, living at home and a fifth, age 19, away at school. \"It was said this could disrupt life. People wouldn't like it. He's not liked. But at the end of the day, this is what Jesus did. He defended the defenseless. He was a friend of sinners.\" Few, if anyone, question Pinckney's intentions. The easygoing minister, who preaches on Sundays while wearing jeans and insists that people call him Dave, is well liked and respected in Chichester. But bringing a high-profile ex-convict, reformed or not, to a rural community where chickens outnumber police officers by a wide margin has not gone unnoticed. \"It's a quiet town,\" said Chichester Selectman Jeff Jordan. \"Somebody's cows getting out in the road, that's the worst thing that happens.\"... But now many locals feel like prisoners in their own homes. Smith said he will not allow his 11-year-old daughter to feed her pony, Wilma, alone anymore. Ingram, who lives near Pinckney, has blocked her back deck with the family's gas grill, a barrier to make sure the children do not go wandering. And police understand the fear. There are just four full-time officers in Chichester. \"My concern is safety,\" said Merrimack County Sheriff Scott Hilliard, whose department assists Chichester police. \"That's the priority, safety of the citizens. To be perfectly honest, I wouldn't want Mr. Guay to be living in my town. I'm a parent, too.\" Pinckney said he appreciates law enforcement officers' concerns - and their support. What's disappointed him, he said, are the reactions of others, given the lengths he is taking to keep Guay under close watch. Though Guay is legally free to go where he pleases, he has agreed to Pinckney's terms that he always remain under adult supervision, and has even volunteered to wear a movement-tracking ankle bracelet like an inmate on house arrest. \"I'm telling you, there are more dangers on my road with alcohol and firearms than there is with Raymond Guay,\" Pinckney said yesterday. \"I would not have brought him into my home if I thought he was a danger to my town, my neighborhood, my neighbors, or my children.\" \"http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2009/03/19/pastors_outreach_hits_a_nerve/?page=2#commentAnchor\" quote: Liberals cannot seem to grasp the concepts of guilt and innocence, evil and good. let's spell it out. Murdering a child= bad, very bad. Murderer = bad, Child = innocent. Serving some time in prison does not make bad people good. Bad/evil people like this cannot be trusted near children because they have demonstrated that they like to harm and kill children. Prison does not change this, nothing changes this. Just as you cannot change a homosexual, or a heterosexual, you cannot cure a child predator. Child murderers do not earn back their innocence by doing time. They don't pay any debt to society, (ask the boy's mother if she feels \"repaid\" for the agony and loss she suffered). They are not and never will be safe, or trustworthy, that is why they should be executed. If I was the victims dad or mother, I would hunt this creep down and make sure he never destroyed another child. If I had terminal cancer, I might do it myself... quote: For all you religion bashers out there, this is more a symptom of Loony Left Liberalism, than that of religion. As a Christian, I believe that an eye for an eye should have come into play here, not 35 years in prison... quote: People in Chichester really want to get rid of this guy? It's quite simple. Stop going to the church this pastor works at. Once the collection plates run dry, the church will act and either fire him or transfer him... quote: I believe that Child welfare should step in and take all of his children away while the pastor and this fellow enjoy one anothers company in the comfort of the children's home. Crazy pastor... quote: I find it insane for him to bring the man into his home where his children live. That's great he thinks he's doing a good deed, but some things are just unforgivable. He also had no consideration for the neighbors... quote: Those of you, members of this Reverend's church; I think you should, all, boycott church services and meetings. March and protest outside of all services and meeting with signs showing your disapproval for what he is doing. We can see what a nut this Reverend is, but I wonder what kind of a nut the mother of these children is. She should put out the Rev. and his new boyfriend, or take the children and move out. If not, I think Child Protective Services should step in and remove these children from the dangerous situation in which they have been placed, by their own father and mother. C'mon, Mom, grow a backbone and don't allow this in your home. You carried these children for 9 months, gave birth, and have been nurturing them. Don't let this clown you married put their lives in danger. And finally: \"http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090318-OPINION-90318016\" quote: When they learned that a local pastor was prepared to take a convicted child killer into his home after the man's release from prison, the townsfolk eagerly lit their handy dandy Acme Villager Torch and did their level best to make sure the new resident was not welcome. Nothing says \"ey, we're here to encourage you to learn to walk the straight and narrow!\"like blind hatred and arson threats... Everyone has their breaking point, and the Chichester residents are making a beeline for parolee Raymond Guay's. Maybe they think if enough people aim their hatred at Guay, he'll kill again and be put away for life. Problem solved... Nobody will hire this man. Anyone who offers to give him a home while he tries to put his life back together will be threatened. Anyone who shows him friendship will be made to suffer... The residents are claiming their children are frightened and can\u2019t sleep. Now why would that be? It certainly couldn\u2019t be due to the fact that they told their children awful things about Guay, could it? Surely all their children are psychic and suddenly, with no foreknowledge, awoke in the night from a premonitory dream, screaming, \u201cMommy, an evil man is coming to town I\u2019m going to die next!\u201d Children aren\u2019t afraid of things they don\u2019t know about. The town of Chichester is determined to spread their prejudice down through the generations. It\u2019s the legacy they\u2019re giving their children... From the accounts that came out of their little town meeting, it sounds like given half a chance, the women of this community would gladly load their shotguns and open fire on Guay rather than give him a chance to prove that he\u2019s seen the error of his ways. It somehow eludes these people that they\u2019ll be doing the same thing Guay did so many years ago. They\u2019ll be killing someone\u2019s child. In cold blood.",

        "reply": "I say it again. You don't find it a little crazy that this \"savior\" would send people away for eternal punishment for being afraid of a murdering rapist? Isn't he supposed to be the lamb, the light, and the gentle shepherd of his flock? But don't his actions bespeak a man who would turn on his friends like a viper for any perceived offense and send them to a punishment un-befitting the crime he perceived? Maybe the lesson you're trying to convey is valid. I don't know, and you can't know either. You haven't met the parson of whom you speak, nor have you met the con. You don't know if he actually is a rapist or sex offender. But, you're trying to make a blanket statement about the nature of nurture, if you will. It's an issue we all struggle with, no matter whether we've read the gospel or not. But you, unaware of what you're actually talking about first hand, suggest you would like us all to go to hell for eternity if we hesitate a moment when considering keeping a con in the house with our kids.",

I was just watching the story of jacob and joseph last night... the stories are from so long ago and yet all the lessons still apply today. I was very upset about the role the women played in those two stories... .. thank goodness there are positive stories of great women in the bible, after eve, rebecca, leah and the wife of the egyptian who sat out to get joseph, it was not looking good for the girls. I find the stories of the bible to be gentle reminders of what is right and wrong, and how to love and forgive.",

However, what the blasphemer apparently is doing isn't to a human, thus not a 'vile human action.' It's a self preserving god-thing defending itself from question or cross examination or contrary thought that encompasses the 'sin of'. Obvious, from reading the Bible it becomes clear there is not all that much care for the 'vile humans' regardless of their god-talk - why, according to the myth, the god guy even lets his own son get tortured and murdered! Of course, the mental gymnastics to justify that is the murder/child sacrafice 'saves' everyone else that believes the story is true, etc. The whole issue of what can and cannot be forgiven is a confusing murky swamp of dubious salvation that can bog down any fearful treading insecure human in their quest to settle down their uneasy conscious. Then there is always the big surprise at the end and the folks who end up on the right hand of god (the good guys and gals) didn't even realize they were doing anything at all to placate the questionably forgiving God (Math 25 'sheep & goats' story.)

David Pinckney's cellphone kept ringing, the pastor took a break and sat down for lunch in the kitchen of his home with his new friend, convicted child killer Raymond Guay. The two men hardly knew each other a week ago. But since Friday, when Pinckney invited Guay, recently paroled, to live with him and his family of five children, the two men's lives have become intertwined. In recent days, both have become pariahs in this tiny, rural New Hampshire community in the hills outside Concord - Pinckney because of his act of kindness and Guay because of his act of evil. Some locals don't claim to understand either, and many want to run Guay out of town. Fear is rampant and growing. Many children here are no longer allowed to play outside. Pinckney said he has received more than one threatening phone call from angry people. \"No Kid Killers,\" says one sign in town, hanging off the side of a parked pickup truck. And people have appealed to elected officials as well. In a town meeting this week, more than 200 people gathered to ask that Guay go somewhere else. But forcing someone to leave isn't exactly easy, or legal. By order of a federal judge, Guay, 60, is supposed to remain in New Hampshire to serve three years of parole. And Pinckney, inviting a reporter into his home for the first time yesterday on the condition that no questions be asked of Guay, made it clear that, protests or not, he and his family are not backing down from their decision to allow Guay to live with them. In fact, on the contrary, Pinckney said, Guay is becoming a beloved house guest. The tall, lanky man with a narrow face and bushy gray beard is making himself useful around the house, helping the Pinckney family to complete an addition above the garage... Convinced that Guay is a changed man - a convert and devoted Christian - Pinckney decided to take the ex-convict into his home for the next two months. And so the *****ly problem of Raymond Guay came to tiny Chichester, population 2,400. \"We were warned,\" said Pinckney, who has four children, ages 13 to 18, living at home and a fifth, age 19, away at school. \"It was said this could disrupt life. People wouldn't like it. He's not liked. But at the end of the day, this is what Jesus did. He defended the defenseless. He was a friend of sinners.\" Few, if anyone, question Pinckney's intentions. The easygoing minister, who preaches on Sundays while wearing jeans and insists that people call him Dave, is well liked and respected in Chichester. But bringing a high-profile ex-convict, reformed or not, to a rural community where chickens outnumber police officers by a wide margin has not gone unnoticed. \"It's a quiet town,\" said Chichester Selectman Jeff Jordan. \"Somebody's cows getting out in the road, that's the worst thing that happens.\"... But now many locals feel like prisoners in their own homes. Smith said he will not allow his 11-year-old daughter to feed her pony, Wilma, alone anymore. Ingram, who lives near Pinckney, has blocked her back deck with the family's gas grill, a barrier to make sure the children do not go wandering. And police understand the fear. There are just four full-time officers in Chichester. \"My concern is safety,\" said Merrimack County Sheriff Scott Hilliard, whose department assists Chichester police. \"That's the priority, safety of the citizens. To be perfectly honest, I wouldn't want Mr. Guay to be living in my town. I'm a parent, too.\" Pinckney said he appreciates law enforcement officers' concerns - and their support. What's disappointed him, he said, are the reactions of others, given the lengths he is taking to keep Guay under close watch. Though Guay is legally free to go where he pleases, he has agreed to Pinckney's terms that he always remain under adult supervision, and has even volunteered to wear a movement-tracking ankle bracelet like an inmate on house arrest. \"I'm telling you, there are more dangers on my road with alcohol and firearms than there is with Raymond Guay,\" Pinckney said yesterday. \"I would not have brought him into my home if I thought he was a danger to my town, my neighborhood, my neighbors, or my children.\" \"http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2009/03/19/pastors_outreach_hits_a_nerve/?page=2#commentAnchor\" quote: Liberals cannot seem to grasp the concepts of guilt and innocence, evil and good. let's spell it out. Murdering a child= bad, very bad. Murderer = bad, Child = innocent. Serving some time in prison does not make bad people good. Bad/evil people like this cannot be trusted near children because they have demonstrated that they like to harm and kill children. Prison does not change this, nothing changes this. Just as you cannot change a homosexual, or a heterosexual, you cannot cure a child predator. Child murderers do not earn back their innocence by doing time. They don't pay any debt to society, (ask the boy's mother if she feels \"repaid\" for the agony and loss she suffered). They are not and never will be safe, or trustworthy, that is why they should be executed. If I was the victims dad or mother, I would hunt this creep down and make sure he never destroyed another child. If I had terminal cancer, I might do it myself... quote: For all you religion bashers out there, this is more a symptom of Loony Left Liberalism, than that of religion. As a Christian, I believe that an eye for an eye should have come into play here, not 35 years in prison... quote: People in Chichester really want to get rid of this guy? It's quite simple. Stop going to the church this pastor works at. Once the collection plates run dry, the church will act and either fire him or transfer him... quote: I believe that Child welfare should step in and take all of his children away while the pastor and this fellow enjoy one anothers company in the comfort of the children's home. Crazy pastor... quote: I find it insane for him to bring the man into his home where his children live. That's great he thinks he's doing a good deed, but some things are just unforgivable. He also had no consideration for the neighbors... quote: Those of you, members of this Reverend's church; I think you should, all, boycott church services and meetings. March and protest outside of all services and meeting with signs showing your disapproval for what he is doing. We can see what a nut this Reverend is, but I wonder what kind of a nut the mother of these children is. She should put out the Rev. and his new boyfriend, or take the children and move out. If not, I think Child Protective Services should step in and remove these children from the dangerous situation in which they have been placed, by their own father and mother. C'mon, Mom, grow a backbone and don't allow this in your home. You carried these children for 9 months, gave birth, and have been nurturing them. Don't let this clown you married put their lives in danger. And finally: \"http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090318-OPINION-90318016\" quote: When they learned that a local pastor was prepared to take a convicted child killer into his home after the man's release from prison, the townsfolk eagerly lit their handy dandy Acme Villager Torch and did their level best to make sure the new resident was not welcome. Nothing says \"ey, we're here to encourage you to learn to walk the straight and narrow!\"like blind hatred and arson threats... Everyone has their breaking point, and the Chichester residents are making a beeline for parolee Raymond Guay's. Maybe they think if enough people aim their hatred at Guay, he'll kill again and be put away for life. Problem solved... Nobody will hire this man. Anyone who offers to give him a home while he tries to put his life back together will be threatened. Anyone who shows him friendship will be made to suffer... The residents are claiming their children are frightened and can\u2019t sleep. Now why would that be? It certainly couldn\u2019t be due to the fact that they told their children awful things about Guay, could it? Surely all their children are psychic and suddenly, with no foreknowledge, awoke in the night from a premonitory dream, screaming, \u201cMommy, an evil man is coming to town I\u2019m going to die next!\u201d Children aren\u2019t afraid of things they don\u2019t know about. The town of Chichester is determined to spread their prejudice down through the generations. It\u2019s the legacy they\u2019re giving their children... From the accounts that came out of their little town meeting, it sounds like given half a chance, the women of this community would gladly load their shotguns and open fire on Guay rather than give him a chance to prove that he\u2019s seen the error of his ways. It somehow eludes these people that they\u2019ll be doing the same thing Guay did so many years ago. They\u2019ll be killing someone\u2019s child. In cold blood.",

However, what the blasphemer apparently is doing isn't to a human, thus not a 'vile human action.' It's a self preserving god-thing defending itself from question or cross examination or contrary thought that encompasses the 'sin of'. Obvious, from reading the Bible it becomes clear there is not all that much care for the 'vile humans' regardless of their god-talk - why, according to the myth, the god guy even lets his own son get tortured and murdered! Of course, the mental gymnastics to justify that is the murder/child sacrafice 'saves' everyone else that believes the story is true, etc. The whole issue of what can and cannot be forgiven is a confusing murky swamp of dubious salvation that can bog down any fearful treading insecure human in their quest to settle down their uneasy conscious. Then there is always the big surprise at the end and the folks who end up on the right hand of god (the good guys and gals) didn't even realize they were doing anything at all to placate the questionably forgiving God (Math 25 'sheep & goats' story.)

Blasphemy against Thor, Cernunnos, Herne, Apollo, Diana, Bridget, Hecate, Artemis, or Zeus would mean nothing to you, and you would mock all those deities without giving it a second thought. You are a non-believer and a blasphemer against that which you do not believe, no more and no less than I am a blasphemer against that which I do not believe. In your church, you would consider me a blasphemer; I do not attend your church. In my church, you would be considered a blasphemer; you do not attend my church. And in America, neither of us is guilty of a crime.",
