All but one of the seven parties in the parliament, ruled by a center-right coalition, backed the legislation, which garnered a 261 to 22 vote, and 16 abstentions, according to the Associated Press. Gender-neutral marriage licenses will begin to be issued starting May 1, replacing a civil union option that has been offered since 1995. Religious institutions will not be compelled to perform ceremonies for gay and lesbian couples. A majority of bishops in the Church of Sweden said that churches should not be allowed the task of handling legal registrations of marriages. The Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Spain, Canada, and South Africa already allow same-sex marriage.

Given that logic, since Iran is the only country that claims to have no homosexuals, I assume that you\u2019re in favor of adopting ALL of their policies? Once AGAIN, your assumption is faulty! But, once again....you've helped to make my point. Simply because Iran (or ANY other nation adopts a policy) is NO reason for America to follow suit, AGREED? Why should any nation adopt our policies then? Why should Iraq be a democracy, why not a dictatorship? Why should Iran not make a bomb? The reason one looks at what other nations do (or don't do) is to see if it is a workable scenario. Like making better cars in Japan, or less expensive TVs in China or not growing our own bananas. In the case of treatment towards homosexuals, some democracy's appear to have something to offer as a feasible plan. But not Iraq, where gays are executed. Are we to be the only example of a correct way to conduct democracy? To treat others? To express freedom and rights? THANK YOU. NOW....you're making good sense. It's pointless for ANY nation to adopt the policies (or, a policy) of other countries....simply because it works....for THEM. But we should examine why it works for them, and we do. Just because they are foreigners doesn't mean they have nothing of value or wisdom.",
