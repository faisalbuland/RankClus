The split happened \"a few weeks ago,\" according to a source close to the couple, but it's unclear what precipitated it. \"It was a mutual thing,\" adds the source. Bristol, the 18-year-old daughter of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, spoke with FOX News in February and told Greta Van Susteren that she and Levi \u2013 who are parents to 2-month-old son, Tripp \u2013 expected to get married after they completed high school. \"It kind of just happened,\" says the source, referring to the split. \"I thought they would stick it out. But I think they can work together to raise Tripp.\" \"I'm not sure what caused [them to break up] \u2013 it's common knowledge,\" says another source who knows the family. Despite the breakup, Levi still sees the couple's son. Levi's dad, Keith Johnston, told PEOPLE recently that his son is a devoted and \"proud father.\"",

Bristol, the 18-year-old daughter of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, spoke with FOX News in February and told Greta Van Susteren that she and Levi \u2013 who are parents to 2-month-old son, Tripp \u2013 expected to get married after they completed high school. \"It kind of just happened,\" says the source, referring to the split. \"I thought they would stick it out.
