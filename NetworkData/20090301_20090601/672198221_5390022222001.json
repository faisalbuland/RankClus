The new chief executive quickly determined whether each manager had the skills to help transform tradition-bound, family-run Fiat -- namely \"speed, simplicity and self-confidence.\" \"Many did not make the cut,\" Marchionne recalled later. Marchionne then dismantled Fiat's old hierarchy in favor of what he calls a \"flat management structure\" -- fewer managers for quicker decisions. He has already said similar changes also are needed at Chrysler, the limping U.S. automaker that he may soon be running. The 56-year-old Marchionne's bold conquest -- a deal finalized Thursday for 20 percent of Chrysler, with not a penny down but in exchange for Fiat technology valued at some $8 billion -- was made possible by the deepening financial crisis that has crippled the automotive industry. Chrysler is just the kind of train wreck the dual Canadian-Italian citizen, who solidified his reputation as a turnaround expert in Switzerland, has shown he can fix, employing an outsider's detachment and a willingness to shake things up. \"He has one method, one genetic impulse,\" said Klaus Stoehlker, a leading Swiss management consultant who observed Marchionne's rise from a controller to the head of Swiss industrial concern Alusuisse Lonza Group, then to the helm of goods inspections firm SGS SA and onward to Fiat in the space of 12 years. In each of those cases, Marchionne walked into situations of weak management and cleaned house, unfettered by local loyalties. (....)
