Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I'm not sure about her point - But to my mind the breakup of Yugoslavia was aimed at destroying a powerful country which protected it's resources from exploitation, into a bunch of little countries that could be safely exploited by the West. This was accomplished by pretending that Yugoslav history began with the seizure of the local government of Kossovo by the Yugoslavs - As if the preceding ethnic cleansing of the Serbs (500,000 down to about a hundred thousand) had not occured.) This was accomplished by manipulating the Croats and others into \"revolting\" against the Central government - And making believe that the US Civil War wasn't a real precedent for us to look at this sudden desire for self determination. Germany for example recognised the \"new\" Croat government on the same day of their independance. The whole breakup of Yugoslavia was planned from the beginning by Western Corporate interests, and succeded beyond their wildest dreams. And in order for this to occur - There had to be \"Bad Guys,\" and the Serbs fitted the Bill. Dave",
