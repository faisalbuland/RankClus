        "content": "From American Chronicle: Atheists seek role in proposed Federal \"Religious History Week\" National Desk May 06, 2009 An Atheist public policy group says that it supports the call by conservative Christians to establish a Federal \"Religious History Week,\" and already has suggestions for a proposed curriculum. A federal bill, the Spiritual Heritage Resolution introduced by Rep. J. Randy Forbes (R-Va.) details how religion and politics have played vital roles in American history. The measure has won enthusiastic support from members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, as well as Gary Bauer and James and Shirley Dobson of the Colorado-based National Day of Prayer. The bill will be re-introduced after NDOP events this Thursday. \"We think that 'Religious History Week' can be a tool for informing the public about the positive and negative roles that religion has played,\" said Dr. Ed Buckner, President of American Atheists. \"Our organization would like to participate and make sure that this federal event presents an objective, scholarly view.\" Among the topics Buckner suggested were discussion segments on religious authoritarianism in colonial-era America; the notorious \"Blue Laws\" that punished those not observing the Sabbath; the use of public taxes to support \"Established\" religions prior to the American Revolution; the effects of religious orthodoxy on free speech and other civil liberties; the resistance of religious groups to the Revolution and \"disestablishment\" of churches; support by religious groups for segregation, racism and stopping women from having voting rights; and the more contemporary role religious groups play in opposing equal treatment for gays, lesbians, youth and women seeking abortion and birth control. \"We have other topics we'd like to bring up, too, as part of this wonderful event,\" said Dr. Buckner. Dave Silverman, Communications Director for American Atheists cautioned that those introducing the Spiritual Heritage Resolution \"should refrain from cherry picking only the positive things some religious groups have done throughout our country's history.\" \"We have to acknowledge that, yes, many progressive religious leaders had good ideas. These must be weighed against the role religion, particularly fundamentalist Christianity, has played in retarding political, social and even technological progress.\" Mr. Silverman added that he and Dr. Buckner look forward to working with any federal or private agencies planning the \"Religious History Week\" if the bill is passed by Congress. \"We just have so many wonderful topics to bring up,\" said Dr. Buckner.",
