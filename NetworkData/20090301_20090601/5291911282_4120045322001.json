Do something that will place you right in a good civil career when you get out. MA would place you right into law enforcement. The rest I wouldn't go for unless your into personal services like cooking, restaurant management etc. Is this all they offered you? Stay out of aviation fields unless you can do ATC. Your best bet is some high tech like IT and electronics/electrical on shipboard, telecommunications is a good one.",

And just because you do law enforcement in the military doesn't mean you are guaranteed a job in that area when you leave. Many police departments are looking for degrees in Criminal or Justice Administration. And I have heard from a few people that honestly they prefer no military police experience.

SOME of the aviation fields can lead to specialized licenses for work after you get out or not! Intell would be good. MA is, as CJ says, good for law enforcement if that's what you strive to do.

Your best bet is some high tech like IT and electronics/electrical on shipboard, telecommunications is a good one. I must refute your post here and now. How can you say to stay out of the Aviation ratings unless it's ATC (Air Traffic Control)? Have you served in every Aviation rating to know this? I retired with 20 years in the Aviation Community as an AT (Avionics Technician). The education and experience I received landed me a beautiful job with one of the top 5 Defense Contractors worldwide. I have an unlimited advancement potential in this job. Many Aviation Ratings are HIGHLY marketable in the civilian world. Pease do not cast dispersions where they are unwarranted. Unless you walk a mile in another man's moccassins just say, \"I dont' know about the Aviation rating's though\" and it will suffice. It would also help to point him/her to the navy forums too.",
