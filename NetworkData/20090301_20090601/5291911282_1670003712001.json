My thesis is \"The debilitating effects of PTSD on soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are not being adequately acknowledged by the US military, nor are soldiers receiving proper treatment or being fairly compensated for its devastating effects on their lives.\" I need some testimonies or stories about PTSD or any information you can provide if you know how many soldiers have it, how it effects them, what is being done for soldiers with PTSD or have any solutions. It would be greatly appreciated and very helpful. Thank you!",
