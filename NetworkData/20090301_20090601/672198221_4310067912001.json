Emerging from a conference with U.S. officials, Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina-Mora said more meetings are needed to develop plans to bring warring drug cartels under control along the border. Medina-Mora said Mexico planned to begin checking 10 percent of the vehicles entering the country from the U.S. for illegal weapons and will more closely check outgoing vehicles for drugs and money. Medina-Mora said the new vehicle-inspection measures were part of Mexico's overall $1.4 billion modernization of border customs and crossing points. The first such vehicle checks are already being carried out in Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas.",

Why should she worry about the city across the border? After all, this is El Paso\u2014the third-safest city in the United States. Things have been changing though. There have been increased incidences of kidnapping. Refugees from war-torn Juarez have begun to cross the border, seeking shelter in the States.

The trouble in Mexico is beginning to be noticed in America. But for the mother doing dishes, it is hard to imagine the appalling conditions just across the border. At daybreak in a once-frequented park in Juarez, the light illuminates a horrific scene: headless corpses dumped in plain sight. Tourists used to stream across from its sister city, El Paso, eager to buy trinkets and souvenirs. The streets now are bare. So are schools, with parents keeping children home in fear for their safety. Here drug gangs are the law\u2014judge, jury and executioner\u2014vehemently defending trade routes in what the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates is a $23 billion a year industry.
