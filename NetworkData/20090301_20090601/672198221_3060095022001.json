Cuba is likely to be at the forefront of discussions at the Summit of the Americas, a gathering of 34 heads of government that has always excluded Cuba, starting April 17 in Trinidad. Cuba's main ally, Venezuela, as well as other countries, have said they want to use the summit to press for closer relations between Washington and Havana. Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez stopped in Havana on Friday to coordinate pre-summit strategy with Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro and his ailing bother Fidel. Why does Cuba continue to be left out of the Summit of the Americas, if Cuba is a friend of Latin American and Caribbean countries?\" Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said during a weekly television address last month.
