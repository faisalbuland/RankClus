What is the Christians fascination with execution? Why do they revere it so? With all these Christians enraptured by the passion of the cross, I have to wonder what it would be like if Jesus was executed in modern times with modern executions devices. What if Christ was executed by the electric chair? Would all the Christians be wearing little gold electric chairs around their necks? Would they have electric chairs on top and in front of their churches? What if Christ was hung around the neck by a noose? Would all the Christians have little gold nooses around their necks? Maybe, they would have a gallows in front of their churches. Don\u2019t you find it odd that the symbol of the Christian Church is an execution device? Just wondering\u2026\u2026\u2026 Wondering are you or are attempting to be sarcastic? I have read a few of your beginning forays on to this board and you came in like someone with a grudge. I had read your lead in posts multiple times over many days to try and be as fair minded as I could, given that you will probably not like me very much since I fall into a category that you seem to have a disdain towards (Christian that is). To answer in my opinion your wondering question, the Cross of Christianity as I have found in my STUDY is one of substitution and not of worship. Jesus' act of dying on the cross is a symbol that the Christians physical dying will not result in a final separation from God. In my study there have been many additions and traditions added to this simple message until many just argue about things that no Christian is authoritative to teach. So may you have a wonderful life free from condemnation from any who claim to be Christian. And just so you know you will never hear me say anything of the sort about condemnation, I have no authority to do so and avoid these acts like the plague. If I have done so in the past, let me apologize and pledge to work to stay far away from any such act in the future. LJ",
