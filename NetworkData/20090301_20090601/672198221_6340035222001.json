If a chaplain was to follow a MP Company into a Afghan village while they do a cordon and search and leave a Bible in every house and hut, in my mind would violate the order. But if the same chaplain as \"off duty\" walking between his CHU and the laundry point and a local worker on post asks him about Jesus and the chaplain talks to him about his faith and gives him a bible after the discussion, I would not see that as a violation. On the surface I agree but the sticking point is the bible. What is the \"intent\" of giving the bible that will define either case as proselytizing. In your first scenario it gives the appearance that conversion is implied and therefore wrong. In the second the question is the same what is the intent of giving the bible. If it's clear that it's given solely as an education resource fine but beyond that I think you're in violation.",
