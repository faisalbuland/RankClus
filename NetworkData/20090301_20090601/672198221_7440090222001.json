Taguba, describing the moment nearly three years later, said, sadly, \u201cI thought they wanted to know. I assumed they wanted to know. I was ignorant of the setting.\u201d In the meeting, the officials professed ignorance about Abu Ghraib. \u201cCould you tell us what happened?\u201d Wolfowitz asked. Someone else asked, \u201cIs it abuse or torture?\u201d At that point, Taguba recalled, \u201cI described a naked detainee lying on the wet floor, handcuffed, with an interrogator shoving things up his rectum, and said, \u2018That\u2019s not abuse. That\u2019s torture.\u2019 There was quiet.\u201d \u201chttp://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/06/25/070625fa_fact_hersh\u201d You are aware that one of the things that bothered Toguba was that he was specifically ordered not to investigate the higher ups?
