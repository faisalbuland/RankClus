People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",

People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",

People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",

People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",

Next the made up statistics. \u201cand in the process burned more fuel in one 24 hour period than I or my whole family will use in a LIFE TIME!!\u201d Which allows for great anger. \u201cWhat a %$@#%$ hypocrite!!\u201d Obama critics think that everyone else is as angry as they are \u2013 but they are not. People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",

Instead, they flew in an Air Force Gulfstream V (C-37A) for their flight to NYC, it's a 12 passenger aircraft. Next the made up statistics. \u201cand in the process burned more fuel in one 24 hour period than I or my whole family will use in a LIFE TIME!!\u201d Which allows for great anger. \u201cWhat a %$@#%$ hypocrite!!\u201d Obama critics think that everyone else is as angry as they are \u2013 but they are not. People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",

First the distortion of facts, either from being ill informed or by exaggerating the story: \u201cWhy a 150 ton flying limousine that take 20-30,000 pound of fuel just to get to altitude???\u201d The Obama's did not take the jumbo jet commonly thought of as the president's plane. Instead, they flew in an Air Force Gulfstream V (C-37A) for their flight to NYC, it's a 12 passenger aircraft. Next the made up statistics. \u201cand in the process burned more fuel in one 24 hour period than I or my whole family will use in a LIFE TIME!!\u201d Which allows for great anger. \u201cWhat a %$@#%$ hypocrite!!\u201d Obama critics think that everyone else is as angry as they are \u2013 but they are not. People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",

First the distortion of facts, either from being ill informed or by exaggerating the story: \u201cWhy a 150 ton flying limousine that take 20-30,000 pound of fuel just to get to altitude???\u201d The Obama's did not take the jumbo jet commonly thought of as the president's plane. Instead, they flew in an Air Force Gulfstream V (C-37A) for their flight to NYC, it's a 12 passenger aircraft. Next the made up statistics. \u201cand in the process burned more fuel in one 24 hour period than I or my whole family will use in a LIFE TIME!!\u201d Which allows for great anger. \u201cWhat a %$@#%$ hypocrite!!\u201d Obama critics think that everyone else is as angry as they are \u2013 but they are not. People are looking for leadership to offer real solutions to real problems. All that the Republicans and conservatives come up with is tax cuts, opposition and pettiness. America is a right of center country. But the Republicans have marginalized themselves, and that does not seem to be changing. So, when automotive execs fly corportate jets to a meeting in DC, they are demonized, they are the scum of the earth because their company's are in trouble and they did something as selfish as that. But....it's okay for the President and his wife to take a \"corporate jet\" to NYC for dinner and a Broadway show for \"date night\" the weekend after the President himself said that we, as a country, are \"out of money\". At least the automotive execs were flying their corporate jets for official business...", 
        "reply": " Government aircraft is how the POTUS travels. Why did he go to NYC for a night out? It is where the best theater in America is. \u201cI am taking my wife to New York City,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cbecause I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished.\u201d",
