If he doesn't become a Democrat he could join the Libertarians who will oppose the Democrats in the future. I'm sure grateful that the Democrats who lead our Country are so dedicated to doing what's best for us in the way of social justice,a fair tax system with prosperity for all and leading us in the fight against global warming. When the Republicans controlled the Congress from 1994 until more recently did they balance the budget or lead with integrity? No, they all were hypnotized by Rush Limbaugh who misled them to all become evil. I mean how else would they have ended up nominating the illiterate George W. Bush? Take pity on those poor misinformed Republicans like Newt Gingrich. Why he doesn't even have a Law Degree. How could he have become a Law Maker who could deal with intellectual heavyweights like President Clinton who balanced the Budget and restored confidence in our Nation? I feel also feel sorry for Dick Cheney who has obviously not been exposed to the truth of what the world has been dealing with because of Rush Limbaugh. And what about Rush Limbaugh? What Agency appointed him to such a prominent role of telling us what to think? All I've heard about Rush Limbaugh is that he was somehow a sports commentator before he burst onto the World Stage. And now he has finally stepped down as leader of the Republican Party and is offering the job to Colin Powell. This is so surreal. This message has been edited.

Liberals and Powell support higher taxes and a larger government. Liberals believe high taxes enable the government to do good and create jobs. Liberals need high taxes for social welfare programs, to provide for the poor, etc. Liberals believe we can\u2019t afford to cut taxes. Powell is a RINO. ______________________________________________ Kegler, that should be posted every day. That stupid argument that the liberals keep trying to have. \"What is a coservative?? What is a RINO?? You splained it short and simple. The question is simple, If Powell says he still is a Republican, Why didn't he support McCain, a fellow middle of the roader and ex-military??? Or could it really have been a racial thing?? And the concept of big government was contrary to the founding principals of our nation...Go read the Federalist Papers. We never, ever were intended to be a Socialist society. It was the RINO of all RINOs Teddy Roosevelt who got this big government idea going and Woody Wilson who really gave it traction.",

So how does stating that make him a RINO? Conservatives support lower taxes and a smaller government. Conservatives believe lower taxes create more incentive for people to work, save, invest, and engage in entrepreneurial endeavors. Money is best spent by those who earn it.
