Now our PREFERENCE for jackets is the Navy CPO dress jacket. Damn nice looking coats and most of us have them already. Problem is they are godawful expensive to order from AAFES or NEX. So I rememebered the set of Dress Blues I got at the Thrift shop on base back in the 80's for $50 and thought hmmm.. So long story short, does anyone have contact information for Thrift shops on different bases that might be interested in letting us purchase the jackets over the phone? We have plenty of guys with exchange priveleges, just no Navy base near us",

We have plenty of guys with exchange priveleges, just no Navy base near us Brother, There are several ways to get a Templar coat at a reasonable price. Visit some local Commandry's in your state and ask them if they have any extra coats that you could try on and swap some things they need in return. Next, visit your local military surplus store and look for some Navy coats to purchase. While the buttons are not the same, you could order them and have them put on by a local seamstress for under $20. Finally, check out ebay, I have heard that they get some good deals from time to time. My .02 cents. Fraternally, /s/ Terry, PM Freemason Knights Templar Hot Topics Moderator",
