I just couldn't tell if you meant that she SHOULD get a lighter sentence if she's hot (and therefore some people think the boy was actually lucky, and some idiot judge would let her off easy), or you just knew she WOULD get a lighter sentence (because even if the boy thinks he's lucky, he's still the victim of rape). We actually agree here - she's guilty as sin, whether she's a supermodel or a hippopotamus, and should serve just as much time for statutory rape as any other pedophile. I have always said that in all posts on the same subject. Women get a light sentence. Should be no different. You are correct, the sentences should be identical, but alas they are not. I know one thing for d*mn sure, if you or I had sex with a 14 year old girl and justified it by saying \"she wanted it, to I gave it to her\" I seriously doubt we would be interviewed by Matt Lauer as if it were an issue of national importance.",
