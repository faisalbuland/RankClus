They never bothered me when I was younger I just went about my life and got drunk. Now that I am older I want to fire them all and hire a new bunch that think more like I do. I can't believe that they can be so stupid and so selfish. They don't remember the people that elected them until it come time for re -election. This boondogle with the bank failure is a prime example. These elected officials were aware of what was going on but didn't do anything to stop it until it was too late. Now they just sit back and point fingers at the other guy. Our country is going downhill and we are losing ground daily. There seem to be nothing that we the common dude can do. We complain to our elected representatives to no avail. anyone with an idea as to what to do with this mess? Well, I will climb down from the soap box and give someone else a place to rant",

If you look at the countries that have presidential replacements coming and going usually have a civil war coming down the pike as well. No matter how much we dislike this guy the best thing we can do is make sure that he knows how we really feel about his policies and honor his term unless something comes up that disqualifies him from that term. It's up to him to decide if he wants the people to like him or hate him. 3 years 9 months and counting. Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
