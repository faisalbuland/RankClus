Mullen, speaking on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, said military forces were stretched thin challenged by two wars and he would need time to study the impact of repeal. \u201c[Y]ou know, I would need some time for a force that's under a great deal of stress \u2013 we're in our sixth year of fighting two wars \u2013 to look at if this change occurs, to look at implementing it in a very deliberate, measured way.\u201d Congress enacted \u201cdon't ask, don't tell\u201d \u2013 the law that prescribes discharge for gay and lesbian service members that do not remain celibate or in the closet \u2013 in 1993; a compromise of sorts negotiated by President Clinton who sought to lift a ban on gay and lesbians. Mullen signaled that the Pentagon has no plans to deviate from current law. \u201cThe president has made his strategic intent very clear, that it's his intent at some point in time to ask Congress to change this law,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cI think it's important to also know that this is the law, this isn't a policy. And for the rules to change, a law has to be changed.\u201d But Mullen also appeared supportive of repeal. When Stephanopoulos asked, \u201cSo it sounds like if the Congress calls you up to testify in this, you're going to say now is not the time to repeal?\u201d Mullen answered: \u201cNo, I actually \u2013 I'm going to talk to the process that we have in this country, which is we follow the law, and if the law changes, we'll comply.

Admiral Mullen said, \"The President has made his strategic intent very clear. . . . I've had discussions with the Joint Chiefs about this. I've done certainly a lot of internal, immediate staff discussions about what the issues would be and . . . .\" Sounds like a plan? No, it doesn't, and without a strong push from the White House, it won't be. Nonetheless, it does show considerable progress from last Tuesday when the Pentagon's press secretary Geoff Morrell (a deputy assistant secretary of defense and Secretary Gates's personal spokesman as well as another holdover from the Bush Administration) was still spouting the old message at Tuesday's Pentagon briefing: \"no internal planning efforts underway in anticipation of a change in that [DADT] law,\" and so on. Business as usual. As to his attitude, here's the video. You can judge for yourself. (The DADT discussion begins about eight minutes in.) The White House changed his mind, however, and Morrell, who said Secretary Gates believed his Tuesday comments had been \"mischaracterized,\" asked him to release a \"statement of clarification,\" something like what Catholics might call an act of contrition. Fox News reported that Morrell gave it to a few Pentagon reporters Thursday night and to the rest of the world Friday morning. At the White House briefing the day before (around the time Morrell first released his \"clarification\"), in response to a question by Ana Marie Cox, Obama's press secretary Robert Gibbs said he believed \"the Pentagon did correct that statement on efforts regarding . . . 'don't ask, don't tell.'\" Well, if they hadn't done it before, they got right on the case and it was done that night. And Chairman Mullen did make it clear on This Week that he knew what the President wanted to accomplish with respect to repealing DADT. \"The President has made his strategic intent very clear,\" he said. \"That it's his intent at some point in time to ask Congress to change the law.\" \"At some point in time . . . \" Now what do you suppose that means? Time is a pretty nebulous notion, and there are an infinite number of points in it. I'd like to know what particular point in time Admiral Mullen and the other deciders at the Pentagon have in mind. This month? This year? Next year? This term? Next term? Somehow, Admiral Mullen didn't convey a sense of urgency to it. Stephanopoulos reminded him that one of his predecessors, General John Shalikashvili, who was chairman in the early '90s, now says he believes \"if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.\" George asked, \"Is he right?\" \"He's certainly entitled to his own personal opinion,\" Admiral Mullen replied, quickly adding \"And certainly, I have the greatest respect for him.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement. In the next sentence he noted, \"There are also lots of retired generals and admirals on the other side.\" I can see Elaine Donnelly now, exchanging high fives for the gratuitous plug with her crew of aging flag officers that Admiral Mullen referred to.
