The maintenance guys had to tear out a portion of my ceiling and put in a new sheet of dryrock. Well....the moron just did it again. The water was flowing in through my kitchen ceiling. I was going to go up there and bang on his door but I had visions of me in a jail cell so thought it would be best to let the landlord handle it. He must have caugh it because the water has stopped. I did get another neighbor to come over to be a witness, plus I took photos. From what I understand, he did this a few years ago before I moved in. That makes it three times now. What a complete MORON! I called the apartment office and left a message as they are closed now. \"Either he goes or I do!\" Anyway....I feel a bit better now after venting. Don",

The maintenance guys had to tear out a portion of my ceiling and put in a new sheet of dryrock. Well....the moron just did it again. The water was flowing in through my kitchen ceiling. I was going to go up there and bang on his door but I had visions of me in a jail cell so thought it would be best to let the landlord handle it. He must have caugh it because the water has stopped. I did get another neighbor to come over to be a witness, plus I took photos. From what I understand, he did this a few years ago before I moved in. That makes it three times now. What a complete MORON! I called the apartment office and left a message as they are closed now. \"Either he goes or I do!\" Anyway....I feel a bit better now after venting. Don",
