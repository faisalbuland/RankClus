Right now, the States are protected by DOMA and are not required to recognize the same-sex marriages performed in other States. Once DOMA is out of the way, a State can be legally challenged in Court if they refuse the accept a same-sex marriage from another State which will eventually lead to a Supreme Court showdown on the Constitutionality of the issue.

Office for Same-Sex Union[Akolouthia eis adelphopoiesin] The priest shall place the holy Gospel on the Gospel stand and they that are to be joined together place their right hands on it, holding lighted candles in their left hands. Then shall the priest cense them and say the following: In peace we beseech Thee, O Lord. That their love [agape] abide without offense or scandal all the days of their lives, we beseech Thee, O Lord. That they be granted all things needed for salvation and godly enjoyment of life everlasting, we beseech Thee, O Lord. That the Lord God grant unto them unashamed faithfulness [pistis] and sincere love [agape anhypokritos], we beseech Thee, O Lord. . . . Have mercy on us, O God. The priest shall say: Forasmuch as Thou, O Lord and Ruler, art merciful and loving, who didst establish humankind after thine image and likeness, who didst deem it meet that thy holy apostles Philip and Bartholomew be united, bound one unto the other not by nature but by faith and the spirit.As Thou didst find thy holy martyrs Serge and Bacchus worthy to be united together [adelphoi genesthai], bless also these thy servants, N. and N., joined together not by the bond of nature but by faith and in the mode of the spirit [ou desmoumenous desmi physeis alla pisteis kai pneumatikos tropi], granting unto them peace [eirene] and love [agape] and oneness of mind. Cleanse from their hearts every stain and impurity and vouchsafe unto them to love one another [to agapan allelous] without hatred and without scandal all the days of their lives, with the aid of the Mother of God and all thy saints, forasmuch as all glory is thine. Another Prayer for Same-Sex Union O Lord Our God, who didst grant unto us all those things necessary for salvation and didst bid us to love one another and to forgive each other our failings, bless and consecrate, kind Lord and lover of good, these thy servants who love each other with a love of the spirit [tous pneumatike agape heautous agapesantas] and have come into this thy holy church to be blessed and consecrated.Grant unto them unashamed fidelity [pistis] and sincere love [agape anhypokritos], and as Thou didst vouchsafe unto thy holy disciples and apostles thy peace and love, bestow them also on these, O Christ our God, affording to them all those things needed for salvation and life eternal. For Thou art the light and the truth and thine is the glory. Then shall they kiss the holy Gospel and the priest and one another, and conclude. It is this ceremonial, and blessings like these, that Boswell claims to be part of a lost, or deliberately suppressed, tradition of church-legitimized same-sex marriages between men. You see, even the church had traditional cerimonies for same gender marriages up until the late 16th or 17th century. I say we need to RETURN to Traditional Marriage that includes same gender cerimonies! Golly gee wilikers Kathy, what the heck do you know 'bout that! You were wrong once again! Of course, you won't admit it tho...you will keep your blinders on, stamp your feet, plug your ears and scream, \"Its always been one man and one woman...traditional marriage...never has it ever been any different\" until you are blue in the face hoping that someone, somewhere will believe you without researching it for themselves. The sad thing is, you feel that denying honest service, denying legal standing to two consenting adults w/no blood ties is somehow the \"moral\" high ground. \"What you do unto the least of these you surely do to me...\" Just saying.",

Has it forced your church to marry any couple against the doctrines of your church? No. It hasn\u2019t mine, either. Has it prevented anyone you know from getting married? Not here, either. Marriage is, first and foremost, a civil legal contract between two people. NO member of the clergy can legally marry anyone without the permission and authority of the State and no one except the court can dissolve a marriage. A church/temple/synagogue/coven/whatever wedding is actually two ceremonies, but conducted as one. There is the civil ceremony, which is legally mandatory, where the principals sign and witness the marriage license and/or certificate. Then there is the religious ceremony, which is legally irrelevant. In Europe, at least in Germany & The Netherlands (I assume other countries as well), these are actually two completely separate functions. The couple first goes to the city hall to perform the actual marriage, and then they go wherever for their religious ceremony, should they choose to have one. You do realize that throughout history oppressors have traditionally denied the right of marriage to those they have oppressed? The theory was that only humans married. By denying the right of marriage they were proclaiming that the others were subhuman! Plantation owners denied the right of their slaves to marry, thus originating \u201cjumping the broom\u201d and similar traditions. Nazi Germany made it illegal for Jews, gypsies & etc to marry. I\u2019m certain that a 10 minute Google could turn up more examples.",
