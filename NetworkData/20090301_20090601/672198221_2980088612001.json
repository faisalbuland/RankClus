That challenge was laid down Tuesday by retired Army Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught at an event marking the start of Women\u2019s History Month at the Women In Military Service For America Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. \u201cDo they still serve tea in the White House?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd if they serve tea at the White House, are there any service women who would be willing to go?\u201d Most of the more than 150 people in the audience were military women, and virtually all of them cheered and raised their hands. \u201cYou\u2019re all invited. I think that\u2019s an excellent idea,\u201d Obama said, singling out one of her staff members who would be the point person. The First Lady praised the women\u2019s memorial, and the women it honors who are serving and have served around the world. She included those who have been wounded, and those who have lost their lives in service. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better way to begin Women\u2019s History Month than coming here to the women\u2019s memorial at Arlington National Cemetery to honor our nation\u2019s service women,\u201d she said. Vaught noted that in making service members and families a priority, Obama is following in the footsteps of Eleanor Roosevelt. If not for Roosevelt\u2019s intervention with her husband President Franklin Roosevelt, women might not have been able to serve in the military, Vaught said. And Eleanor Roosevelt \u201cfrequently had service women in for tea at the White House,\u201d which many women veterans of World War II have cited as their most memorable experience, Vaught said.

Whenever you make an assumption, you make an azz out of you and umption. Seriously though, you assume too much, and you don't even try to counter my argument. So, are you saying it isn't lip service? Isn't military support usually lip service anyway (Yes, I realize she's not a politician, but she's still playing the game)? While I'll concede that the \"proud of her nation\" statement gets overplayed, it is still funny, and I will continue to use it when appropriate. On the other hand, perhaps she spoke with her heart when she put her foot in her mouth. In either case, I'm sure she loves her country now that her husband is President. To sum up, I'd prefer her not to play lipservice to the troops, so you're assumption is false. I have more respect for people who do and say what they mean, rather than playing political games. As much as I love my country, and always have, unlike our First Lady , in some respects I am glad that I am no longer actively serving in the military (although, I am in the IRR presently), since I feel that we are being used as political capital at this point. I hope people here don't misunderstand me on this issue. I feel that if we are to go to war, we go there to win. Use me to kill the enemy or assist others to do so, but don't use me as political capital. I'm not against the war, but at this point, if I were to be sent back, I would feel that it would be for nothing, fully expecting the dagger of Congress to be plunged in our backs for political gain whenever it is convenient for them to do so.",

If she didn't say anything to support service members, you'd slam her for not supporting the troops. And when she does make a supportive statement and positive gesture, you call it lip service. For people with your perspective, nothing will be good enough and nothing will make you happy. It must be a miserable life to see everything so negatively. On the contrary, it's not a miserable life except for the fact of a misguided policy on economics and mountains of debt we'll likely never recover from. Other then that, who said she was finally proud of her country? Nawww, I would call it 'lip service' as you say. I'd call it condescending and patronizing! Cut out the swine smell money, the study of bees and grape genetics money and I would agree with you.",

By the way, your beloved Palin governs a state on that self-same ring of fire. Bet she is a big backer of funds to the USGS.",

Time will tell if the Obama's are really behind the military and their families but for now I want to hope that they are. I think they more than anyone will now have a new found respect for our military. They now have access to information on what is really going on behind the smoke and mirrors and just how much we depend on our military, just how much they do for us, and just how much they do without. I am hoping this will wake the Obama's up and they can wake up their party and our country as to just how much we need to respect and support our military.",
