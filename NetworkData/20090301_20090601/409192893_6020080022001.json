Here is the part that caught my attention: Parents must actively oppose this hijacking of the classroom for political purposes. The GBLT, the Athiests, the 'Religions Other Than Christianity', and 'everyone and their dog' want to let the school be school and to keep the \"agendas\" out of the schools. Their reasoning is sound, ('Don't indoctrinate their impressionable young minds. Allow their parents to guide them on moral decisions.), but they want to then turn around and \"indoctrinate their impressionable young minds\" onto their agenda. Feel free to comment. I almost put this on the \"Gay in the Military\" thread, but it's not about the military...it's about our children. Thankfully, mine have already graduated. Message follows: April 7, 2009 If your child's school allows \"Day of Silence\" propaganda, keep your child at home April 17 The Day of Silence, which is sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), fast approaches. This year it will take place in most public schools on April 17. On this day, thousands of public high schools and increasing numbers of middle schools will allow students to remain silent throughout an entire day-even during instructional time-to promote GLSEN's socio-political goals and its controversial, unproven, and destructive theories on the nature and morality of homosexuality. Parents must actively oppose this hijacking of the classroom for political purposes. Please join the national effort -http://www.illinoisfamily.org/doswalkout- to restore to public education a proper understanding of the role of government-subsidized schools. You can help de-politicize the learning environment by calling your child out of school if your child's school allows students to remain silent during instructional time on the Day of Silence. Parents should no longer passively countenance the political usurpation of public school classrooms through student silence. If students will be permitted to remain silent, parents can express their opposition most effectively by calling their children out of school on the Day of Silence and sending letters of explanation to their administrators, their children\u2019s teachers, and all school board members. One reason this is effective is that most school districts lose money for each student absence. School administrators err when they allow the classroom to be disrupted and politicized by granting students permission to remain silent throughout an entire day. Visit this website -http://www.illinoisfamily.org/doswalkout/ - for complete information on opposing the Day of Silence. Take Action! 1. Call your local schools and ask whether they permit students or teachers to remain silent in the classroom on \u201cDay of Silence.\u201d IMPORTANT: Do not ask any administrator, school board member, or teacher if the school sponsors, endorses, or supports DOS. Schools do not technically sponsor the Day of Silence. Technically, it is students, often students in the gay-straight alliance, who sponsor it. Many administrators will tell you that they do not sponsor the DOS when, in fact, they do permit students and sometimes even teachers to remain silent during instructional time. Also ask administrators whether they permit teachers to create lesson plans to accommodate student silence. 2. Find out what date the event is planned for your school. (The national date in 2009 is April 17, but some schools observe DOS on a different date). 3. Inform the school of your intention to keep your children home on that date and explain why. (A sample letter is available -http://www.illinoisfamily.org/content/img/f34263/sample-call-out-letter.doc- .)

        "quote": "Originally posted by Bleah: Is there a rule in your local school that students must talk? The day of silence allows for answering questions and participating in group dicsussion. This is not talking in the hall, in the lunchroom, or unless absolutely necessary. Are you going to punish kids for not talking to each other on this day? You people are off your rocker. I mean just READ about what you're supposed to get all bent out of shape about: quote: Parents should no longer passively countenance the political usurpation of public school classrooms through student silence. That sentence is the most laughable I've read in an activist email in years. I lifted the following passage from a website that makes a lot more sense than your rediculous chain email, that is the official DOS website. I would post a link, but mil.com is run by morons who fear links like Satan's spawn. OR...you could do as I did, blech, put the link url in your post and make sure it's not a 'hot' link. Oh, wait. That would mean that you have one less tirade to throw out here. My bad, I forgot that truth and helpfullness is NOT part of YOUR agenda.
