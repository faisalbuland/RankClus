CBS News affiliate WNEM-TV5 said police had identified the teen as Brett Elder. A police news release says officers answered a report of a fight about 3:40 a.m. Sunday. The statement says two males were arguing in an apartment, and one of them \"attempted to fight the officers.\" Police say police Tasered him, and his reaction led them to immediately call for emergency medical help. He was pronounced dead at Bay Regional Medical Center. \"He was flopping around and looked like a fish out of water,\" Elder\u2019s aunt Cindy Hernden told WNEM. \"That\u2019s the only way to explain it - his whole body was bent over.\" Hernden did admit to the TV station that Elder had attempted to punch of the officers, but said the officer's use of a Taser was excessive as her nephew was already in handcuffs. Deputy Chief Thomas Pletzke told TV5 however that Elder was not handcuffed when the Taser was fired. Deputy Chief Thomas Pletzke said one officer had been put on administrative leave.",

CBS News affiliate WNEM-TV5 said police had identified the teen as Brett Elder. A police news release says officers answered a report of a fight about 3:40 a.m. Sunday. The statement says two males were arguing in an apartment, and one of them \"attempted to fight the officers.\" Police say police Tasered him, and his reaction led them to immediately call for emergency medical help. He was pronounced dead at Bay Regional Medical Center. \"He was flopping around and looked like a fish out of water,\" Elder\u2019s aunt Cindy Hernden told WNEM. \"That\u2019s the only way to explain it - his whole body was bent over.\" Hernden did admit to the TV station that Elder had attempted to punch of the officers, but said the officer's use of a Taser was excessive as her nephew was already in handcuffs. Deputy Chief Thomas Pletzke told TV5 however that Elder was not handcuffed when the Taser was fired. Deputy Chief Thomas Pletzke said one officer had been put on administrative leave.",
