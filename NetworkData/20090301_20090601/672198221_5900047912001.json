Jasim, whose name is being withheld for his safety, has received strong support from the U.S. military, and the Department of Homeland Security approved his application for a visa. But the State Department has denied Jasim a visa because he was arrested in 1996 for actions against the Saddam dictatorship. . . Because Iraqi translators are seen by jihadists and former Baathists as \"traitors,\" Jasim's life is at greater risk the longer he stays in Iraq, according to multiple State Department and U.S. military officials. A number of translators and their families have already been tortured and/or murdered. . . U.S. military officials familiar with Jasim's case believe that he will be in even greater danger after U.S. forces withdraw from most of Iraq next year. The State Department, meanwhile, has told Jasim that he must wait three more years before he can apply for a waiver of its visa rejection. . . During his three years as a translator, Jasim has exposed himself to enemy fire in the course of saving American lives. Three different Americans who served with him in Iraq told FOXNews.com that they are alive today because of Jasim. \"The only reason I am here today is because of Jasim,\" said Elisabeth Keene, a U.S. Army specialist who serves in a combat unit. \"He saved the life of everyone in my unit. \"On several occasions while our guys were putting rounds down range, Jasim put himself in harm's way to pull the wounded out and treat them,\" Keene said. \"Jasim is a hero to everyone he has ever met.\" \"I owe my life to Jasim ... hands down,\" said Master Sgt. Jason Krieger, who went on over 200 combat patrols with Jasim. \"I consider him a brother, not only in arms, but in love as well.\" Those who have worked with Jasim are astonished at the decision to deny him a visa. FOXNews.com has obtained numerous letters submitted by U.S. Army and Marine Corps personnel supporting his application. Each letter praises his heroism in glowing terms and strongly recommends issuing a visa. Jasim even received letters of recommendation from a couple of two-star generals. It is unusual for a translator's visa application to be endorsed even by one general. U.S. Army Captain Joseph Schwankhaus wrote about one day in particular when Jasim performed multiple heroic acts. \"While establishing security positions around a patrol that was struck by an IED, [Jasim] singlehandedly removed a wounded soldier from a disabled vehicle and ensured that he was treated by the company medic. During this security cordon, another soldier was shot in the head by a sniper and a large fire fight ensued. [Jasim], while under direct enemy fire provided cover for the wounded soldier while medical personnel rendered life-saving first aid.\" Schwankhaus stated emphatically, \"His dedication to my soldiers and his total disregard for his own personal safety assisted in saving the life of a very good Non-Commissioned Officer.\" . . It's a concern shared by Americans who have served with him. \"To deprive him of his opportunity to protect his family, after he had protected mine for well over a year, is nothing short of criminal,\" said Master Sgt. Krieger. \"Every day he remains in Iraq, he, his wife, and newborn son are at risk of death, solely due to his service to our country.\" <much more> \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,512422,00.html\" This administration decision epitomizes \"stupid\".

Paterson imam fights deportation by Brian Donohue/The Star-Ledger Wednesday May 07, 2008, 12:05 AM Mitsu Yasukawa / The Star LedgerImam Mohammad Qatanani The day after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, FBI agents seeking Arabic interpreters turned to the Islamic Center of Passaic County in Paterson, where the imam, Mohammad Qatanani, instructed the faithful to lend the agents a hand. In 2005, the New Jersey Senate tapped Qatanani to be the first Muslim to lead the opening prayer for a voting session, praising him as a voice of moderation and tolerance. And for years, Jewish and Christian clergy have called on Qatanani to speak at programs promoting interfaith dialogue. Twelve years after he arrived from the West Bank, however, Qatanani's days as the Garden State's most visible Muslim cleric may be coming to an end. Qatanani, his wife and three children are facing deportation for his alleged failure to disclose a 1993 arrest by Israeli authorities on his green card application. Israeli military officials told the Associated Press he confessed to being a member of Hamas, a known terrorist organization. Qatanani denies the charge. Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will begin presenting the case before an immigration judge in Newark Thursday. Muslim leaders and the rank-and-file faithful across New Jersey are calling it a watershed moment for a community that has often struggled for acceptance. \"If a man of moderation is being put out in this fashion, what kind of Muslim does America want?\" said Aref Assaf, president of the Denville-based Arab American Forum. Qatanani's supporters have raised $100,000 for his defense, printed shirts reading \"Keep the Imam in America\" and hired a fleet of buses to take them to a rally outside the courtroom. His lawyer has assembled a list of character witnesses that includes a rabbi, three Christian clergymen, the Bergen County and Passaic County sheriffs and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark. U.S. Rep. William Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) has written a letter to the judge calling the imam \"a gentleman who's had a tremendous positive influence.",

He acknowledged that the decision was based on Jasim's theft of Uday Hussein's car, which he said was not deemed a \"political\" act for purposes of the visa denial. Based on government documents obtained by FOXNews.com, it appears that the Department of Homeland Security cleared Jasim for a visa, issuing him last May a \"notice of approval.\" Jendrisak, however, said that DHS had no authority to issue a visa now.

Jason Krieger, who went on over 200 combat patrols with Jasim. \"I consider him a brother, not only in arms, but in love as well.\" Those who have worked with Jasim are astonished at the decision to deny him a visa. FOXNews.com has obtained numerous letters submitted by U.S. Army and Marine Corps personnel supporting his application. Each letter praises his heroism in glowing terms and strongly recommends issuing a visa. Jasim even received letters of recommendation from a couple of two-star generals. It is unusual for a translator's visa application to be endorsed even by one general. U.S. Army Captain Joseph Schwankhaus wrote about one day in particular when Jasim performed multiple heroic acts. \"While establishing security positions around a patrol that was struck by an IED, [Jasim] singlehandedly removed a wounded soldier from a disabled vehicle and ensured that he was treated by the company medic.

It's a concern shared by Americans who have served with him. \"To deprive him of his opportunity to protect his family, after he had protected mine for well over a year, is nothing short of criminal,\" said Master Sgt.

In 2005, the New Jersey Senate tapped Qatanani to be the first Muslim to lead the opening prayer for a voting session, praising him as a voice of moderation and tolerance. And for years, Jewish and Christian clergy have called on Qatanani to speak at programs promoting interfaith dialogue. Twelve years after he arrived from the West Bank, however, Qatanani's days as the Garden State's most visible Muslim cleric may be coming to an end. Qatanani, his wife and three children are facing deportation for his alleged failure to disclose a 1993 arrest by Israeli authorities on his green card application. Israeli military officials told the Associated Press he confessed to being a member of Hamas, a known terrorist organization. Qatanani denies the charge. Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will begin presenting the case before an immigration judge in Newark Thursday. Muslim leaders and the rank-and-file faithful across New Jersey are calling it a watershed moment for a community that has often struggled for acceptance. \"If a man of moderation is being put out in this fashion, what kind of Muslim does America want?\" said Aref Assaf, president of the Denville-based Arab American Forum. Qatanani's supporters have raised $100,000 for his defense, printed shirts reading \"Keep the Imam in America\" and hired a fleet of buses to take them to a rally outside the courtroom. His lawyer has assembled a list of character witnesses that includes a rabbi, three Christian clergymen, the Bergen County and Passaic County sheriffs and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark.

Jasim, whose name is being withheld for his safety, has received strong support from the U.S. military, and the Department of Homeland Security approved his application for a visa. But the State Department has denied Jasim a visa because he was arrested in 1996 for actions against the Saddam dictatorship. . . Because Iraqi translators are seen by jihadists and former Baathists as \"traitors,\" Jasim's life is at greater risk the longer he stays in Iraq, according to multiple State Department and U.S. military officials. A number of translators and their families have already been tortured and/or murdered. . . U.S. military officials familiar with Jasim's case believe that he will be in even greater danger after U.S. forces withdraw from most of Iraq next year.

During his three years as a translator, Jasim has exposed himself to enemy fire in the course of saving American lives. Three different Americans who served with him in Iraq told FOXNews.com that they are alive today because of Jasim. \"The only reason I am here today is because of Jasim,\" said Elisabeth Keene, a U.S. Army specialist who serves in a combat unit. \"He saved the life of everyone in my unit. \"On several occasions while our guys were putting rounds down range, Jasim put himself in harm's way to pull the wounded out and treat them,\" Keene said. \"Jasim is a hero to everyone he has ever met.\" \"I owe my life to Jasim ... hands down,\" said Master Sgt. Jason Krieger, who went on over 200 combat patrols with Jasim. \"I consider him a brother, not only in arms, but in love as well.\" Those who have worked with Jasim are astonished at the decision to deny him a visa. FOXNews.com has obtained numerous letters submitted by U.S. Army and Marine Corps personnel supporting his application. Each letter praises his heroism in glowing terms and strongly recommends issuing a visa. Jasim even received letters of recommendation from a couple of two-star generals. It is unusual for a translator's visa application to be endorsed even by one general. U.S. Army Captain Joseph Schwankhaus wrote about one day in particular when Jasim performed multiple heroic acts. \"While establishing security positions around a patrol that was struck by an IED, [Jasim] singlehandedly removed a wounded soldier from a disabled vehicle and ensured that he was treated by the company medic. During this security cordon, another soldier was shot in the head by a sniper and a large fire fight ensued. [Jasim], while under direct enemy fire provided cover for the wounded soldier while medical personnel rendered life-saving first aid.\" Schwankhaus stated emphatically, \"His dedication to my soldiers and his total disregard for his own personal safety assisted in saving the life of a very good Non-Commissioned Officer.\" . . It's a concern shared by Americans who have served with him. \"To deprive him of his opportunity to protect his family, after he had protected mine for well over a year, is nothing short of criminal,\" said Master Sgt.

Paterson imam fights deportation by Brian Donohue/The Star-Ledger Wednesday May 07, 2008, 12:05 AM Mitsu Yasukawa / The Star LedgerImam Mohammad Qatanani The day after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, FBI agents seeking Arabic interpreters turned to the Islamic Center of Passaic County in Paterson, where the imam, Mohammad Qatanani, instructed the faithful to lend the agents a hand. In 2005, the New Jersey Senate tapped Qatanani to be the first Muslim to lead the opening prayer for a voting session, praising him as a voice of moderation and tolerance. And for years, Jewish and Christian clergy have called on Qatanani to speak at programs promoting interfaith dialogue. Twelve years after he arrived from the West Bank, however, Qatanani's days as the Garden State's most visible Muslim cleric may be coming to an end. Qatanani, his wife and three children are facing deportation for his alleged failure to disclose a 1993 arrest by Israeli authorities on his green card application. Israeli military officials told the Associated Press he confessed to being a member of Hamas, a known terrorist organization. Qatanani denies the charge. Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will begin presenting the case before an immigration judge in Newark Thursday. Muslim leaders and the rank-and-file faithful across New Jersey are calling it a watershed moment for a community that has often struggled for acceptance. \"If a man of moderation is being put out in this fashion, what kind of Muslim does America want?\" said Aref Assaf, president of the Denville-based Arab American Forum. Qatanani's supporters have raised $100,000 for his defense, printed shirts reading \"Keep the Imam in America\" and hired a fleet of buses to take them to a rally outside the courtroom. His lawyer has assembled a list of character witnesses that includes a rabbi, three Christian clergymen, the Bergen County and Passaic County sheriffs and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark. U.S. Rep. William Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) has written a letter to the judge calling the imam \"a gentleman who's had a tremendous positive influence.",
