Even better, this same GOP leadership might have done even more homework and figured out that the U.S. economy experienced a major Depression in 1921, but with the federal government\u2019s actions still informed by a Constitution that greatly limited the activities of the federal government, it quite simply did nothing. Sure enough, during the early \u201820s downturn the federal government correctly deduced that the last thing it wanted to do was burden the business sector with more federal spending, so it actually decreased government outlays, reduced taxes slightly, and balanced the budget. And the U.S. economy soared. Maybe the truly misguided GOP of the George W. Bush years has figured out how totally ineffective government spending always is. But in case Brooks is not convinced, a thought experiment is in order. Let\u2019s assume that the New York Times\u2019 Metro desk is on one floor in the venerable paper\u2019s new building, and that editorial staff is on another floor. After that, let\u2019s assume that the Metro staffers enter the offices of Brooks, Nic Kristof, Maureen Dowd and Paul Krugman, steal whatever cash is lying around, and then go spend it wildly in Manhattan. Would midtown-Manhattan\u2019s economy be stimulated, or would Brooks, Kristof, Dowd, and Krugman be that much poorer the next time they wanted to go hog wild in Times Square? What Brooks never bothered to explain as he smacked the GOP for its allegedly born-again thriftiness is how government profligacy with money borrowed or taxed from the private sector would actually enhance economic growth. Brooks correctly suggests that the GOP should talk up capitalism as \u201cin innovative force,\u201d then contradicts his previous suggestion by adding on that \u201cwe have been reminded of its shortcomings.\u201d All this begs a basic question about what our present economic predicament has to do with capitalism? Indeed, wasn\u2019t it the federal government (on Bush\u2019s watch) that made a weak dollar its specific policy such that hapless Americans did as they\u2019ve always done and hedged government thievery with real estate purchases? When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed congressional orders to make home loans available to the weakest of credit risks, was this a failure of capitalism? When some of the federally subsidized borrowers predictably proved unequal to the task of paying off their mortgages, wasn\u2019t it the U.S. Senate (with the Obama administration\u2019s approval) that introduced a mortgage \u201ccramdown\u201d bill that insured \u201cfrozen\u201d markets for the mortgage securities that are destroying bank balance sheets? No doubt lots of mistakes were made of the public and private variety, but it would be nice if just once, Brooks or someone else explained where capitalism was at fault. Logic says capitalism was never practiced, but now that some Republicans have woken up to the utter disaster that is TARP, a non-capitalist concept if there ever was one, Brooks decries \u201call this populist talk about letting Citigroup fail.\u201d In truth, had Washington let Citigroup fail, that would have been the sole example of true capitalism being practiced in that we know the latter is working when, yes, businesses fail. Had true capitalism ever been considered amid this mess, failing companies regardless of sector would have been allowed to go bankrupt so that more effective managers could have taken over their assets. Instead, and in a repeat of Japan\u2019s mistakes over the last twenty years, taxpayer money will prop up the walking dead, including GM, Chrysler, AIG, and Citigroup, which means we\u2019ll weaken the various capitalistic companies that did not take government funds in order to \u201csave\u201d those that did. Brooks is troubled by a GOP that fails to treat our present problems \u201clike a genuine emergency\u201d, but assuming this is true, it seems the Republicans have at long last found their way. Indeed, wasn\u2019t it the GOP controlled Congress that gave the U.S. economy the bodyblow that was Sarbanes-Oxley after the Enron and Worldcom \u201ccrises\u201d? Wasn\u2019t it the same GOP-led Congress that foisted the first of two \u201cstimulus\u201d packages on President Bush\u2019s watch that did nothing to stimulate the economy? Wasn\u2019t President Bush\u2019s selling of the free market down the river in the dying days of his administration example enough for Brooks of how tragically his party overreacted? In a 2007 column for the Weekly Standard, Brooks perhaps gave voice to the kind of Republican Party he wanted. In the column he observed that, \"American purpose can find its voice only in Washington.\" Judging by activist government activity by the GOP in the aftermath of the column, it seems Brooks\u2019s advice was followed, albeit all the way to a party change at the White House, and Democrat control of both houses. So while Brooks decries what he deems the party of \u201cno\u201d, it just may be that the Republicans have finally figured out that big government and excessive government intrusion in the economy not only offend the base, but fail miserably.
