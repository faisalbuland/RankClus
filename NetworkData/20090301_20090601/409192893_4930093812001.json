I dont even know the number of individuals that received the bonus's, nor do i know the amount. If a person entered into a contract with AIG or anyone else, then that might just be a binding tool. Today rep Barney Franks announced he wants crimninal prosecution towards the individuals that caused this mess, this man is way out in left field. Barney Franks needs to be muzzled and or ignored, he is head of the banking cmt and he is one of the culprits that caused most of this.. but i doubt if this grandstand play by the house will fly",

I am curious as to whether the objections here are over the use of the tax code or whether the poster genuinely think these people deserve to take $165 million from us and put it straight in their pockets. Oh yeah: Congress and the Obama administration dropped the ball by not catching this crap at the start.

Still, starting from here (we gave them the money, they pocketed the bonuses), what should be done?", 
        "reply": " you raise a good point. I dont even know the number of individuals that received the bonus's, nor do i know the amount. If a person entered into a contract with AIG or anyone else, then that might just be a binding tool. Today rep Barney Franks announced he wants crimninal prosecution towards the individuals that caused this mess, this man is way out in left field. Barney Franks needs to be muzzled and or ignored, he is head of the banking cmt and he is one of the culprits that caused most of this.. but i doubt if this grandstand play by the house will fly",

I dont even know the number of individuals that received the bonus's, nor do i know the amount. If a person entered into a contract with AIG or anyone else, then that might just be a binding tool. Today rep Barney Franks announced he wants crimninal prosecution towards the individuals that caused this mess, this man is way out in left field. Barney Franks needs to be muzzled and or ignored, he is head of the banking cmt and he is one of the culprits that caused most of this.. but i doubt if this grandstand play by the house will fly",

I am curious as to whether the objections here are over the use of the tax code or whether the poster genuinely think these people deserve to take $165 million from us and put it straight in their pockets. Oh yeah: Congress and the Obama administration dropped the ball by not catching this crap at the start.

Still, starting from here (we gave them the money, they pocketed the bonuses), what should be done?", 
        "reply": " you raise a good point. I dont even know the number of individuals that received the bonus's, nor do i know the amount. If a person entered into a contract with AIG or anyone else, then that might just be a binding tool. Today rep Barney Franks announced he wants crimninal prosecution towards the individuals that caused this mess, this man is way out in left field. Barney Franks needs to be muzzled and or ignored, he is head of the banking cmt and he is one of the culprits that caused most of this.. but i doubt if this grandstand play by the house will fly",

Yah, an attempt to get the bonus money (that the dems screwed the pooch and allowed to happen) by an illegal tax move by a Congress that doesnt seem to give a schyte about what the constitution says. So, they break the ice with this illegal bill with the approval of a bunch of sheople, and what's next. Let's change amendment 1 to say that people are free to say what we want them to. The people have made it clear that they think the money was unearned and should not have been paid.

I do, at the risk of being redundant, think that we ought not to start \u2014 you know, the government basically is not in this business \u2014 start dictating every thing they can do in their businesses.

So I think that the principle is sound. I'm not necessarily advocating going forward, that the federal government be able to set salaries across the board for any company. I think that that is just not what we're about. We're a free-market country. We love ya Cantor! Yes we should give them the money, get an 80% stake in the company, then let them do whatever they want, you know, because it is a free country and we believe in free markets. You just can't make this **** up. Unbelievable. What is unbelievable to me is that a former member of the military would be \"proud\" of the fact that the American Government is taking control of a private business and telling the CEO and board members how they can run their business, and then use the governments strong right arm to tax individual citizens out of money that is theirs, even if not righteously. So, why don't we pass new tax laws to kill all of the gangs, the drug cartells, the organized crime figures?? All we have to do is suspect them, don't have to prove anything. We've got kool-aid drinkers to back up the shady politicians.",
