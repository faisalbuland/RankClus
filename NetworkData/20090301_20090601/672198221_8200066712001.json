With the way the economy is, and with so many American's not getting proper health care, or are uninsured, here we have a group of people getting almost free care from the VA, and they are still complaining. I have been getting VA healthcare for many years, with co-pays, and I have nly received top-notch care and follow-up care from the VA every time. The amount of my co-pay is a smidgen to what I used to pay when I had private care and co-pays. Dont worry folks, Barack Obama will not be cutting VA healthcare benefits anytime soon, or during in his administration NEVER. He also campaigned against taxing health care benefits, so don't get comfortable in your complacency. Will the antics of Barack Obama bring about the demise of Jack_Flats????????",
