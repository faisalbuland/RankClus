Despite what many think, the Iranians are not completely insane. Great observations. It's easy to overlook (or just plain ignore) that Iran is a relatively modern society as it goes in that part of the world. They work, they worship, they shop, they love their ice cream; they hold something very much like free and fair elections, and many are trying to implement changes to draconian social policies at the polls. Can you imagine being a modern urbane society with a foot-in-the-mouth megalomaniac president surrounded by morons who take all their cues from the religious right? [sarcasm]I didn't think so...[/sarcasm] The real value of a nuke is as a threat. Like the Godfather said, a threat is no good if you have to use it. The first guy to use a nuke in today's world digs two graves - one for the other guy and one for himself. The only time nukes have been used is when we were the only ones that had them. The old Soviet Union was just as fanatical as any state existing today but when the chips are down, fanaticism has always given way to pragmatism. Iran will be pragmatic. Al Qeda might not be pragmatic at all but no state is going to back these guys with a nuke since that hand could not be hidden. Doesn't mean they can't get a nuke and it doesn't mean they won't but I don't lose sleep over Iran. The dynamics in Pakistan are a different story but if they don't lose their country, all is well. Mostly. International terrorists are a definite threat to the world. Always has been, always will be.",
