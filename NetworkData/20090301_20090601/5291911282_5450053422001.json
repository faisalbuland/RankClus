        "content": "His name is Harry Ellsworth Scott. I believe he was a SFC. His nickname was \"Red\" because of his red hair. He was from Pennsylvania. He was spent three years in the U S Navy and then joined the U S Army. He was assigned to the 28th Infantry in the 1940's. From what I can tell he was assigned to the 28th replacement company under Capt Harold L. Fleck, 1st Lt. Harry E. Reitz and 2nd Lt. Walter H. Fox. My DAD never talk much about his years in the U S Army. He spent 20+ years of his life serving this fine country and when I checked with St. Louis records; all I got was \"A fire destroyed your dad's records\". Someone out there has got to remember my dad and I'm asking for your help. Some information I was able to gather indicates that my dad was assigned to the following bases and or units: \"KMAG\"-Korean Military Advisory Group?; Ft. Meade, MD (possible MP); Ft. Hollibird, MD; Ft. Greeley, Alaska (1963); Ft. Knox, KY; Ft. Dix, NJ. He spent time in Korea, Vietnam and I'm not sure where else? He was originally from Aliquippa, PA and spent time in New Castle, PA. From what I can tell by some of his patches and pins: Alaskan Defense Command Patch, Drill Instructor Badge, 28th Infantry \"Keystone-Bloody Bucket\", 2nd Armored Division \"Hell on Wheels\", a Red Diamond possibly the 5th infantry, and the 45th Thunderbirds Patch. Not much of this makes sense to me so I'm asking for your help to locate anyone who may recall my father or mother (her name was Helen). Please send email to: I'm sorry, but personal contact information is not authorized. You may want to post this here: Army Missing Persons We wish you great success and please keep us posted.
