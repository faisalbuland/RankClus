He is not. \"Back in February, the Obama administration shocked many civil libertarians by filing a brief in federal court that, in two sentences, declared that it embraced the most extremist Bush theory on this issue -- the Obama DOJ argued, as The New York Times's Charlie Savage put it, \"that military detainees in Afghanistan have no legal right to challenge their imprisonment there, embracing a key argument of former President Bush\u2019s legal team.\" Remember: these are not prisoners captured in Afghanistan on a battlefield. Many of them have nothing to do with Afghanistan and were captured far, far away from that country -- abducted from their homes and workplaces -- and then flown to Bagram to be imprisoned. Indeed, the Bagram detainees in the particular case in which the Obama DOJ filed its brief were Yemenis and Tunisians captured outside of Afghanistan (in Thailand or the UAE, for instance) and then flown to Bagram and locked away there as much as six years without any charges. That is what the Obama DOJ defended, and they argued that those individuals can be imprisoned indefinitely with no rights of any kind -- as long as they are kept in Bagram rather than Guantanamo. Last month, a federal judge emphatically rejected the Bush/Obama position and held that the rationale of Boudemiene applies every bit as much to Bagram as it does to Guantanamo. Notably, the district judge who so ruled -- John Bates -- is an appointee of George W. Bush, a former Whitewater prosecutor, and a very pro-executive-power judge. In his decision (.pdf), Judge Bates made clear how identical are the constitutional rights of detainees flown to Guantanamo and Bagram and underscored how dangerous is the Bush/Obama claim that the President has the right to abduct people from around the world and imprison them at Bagram with no due process of any kind.\" This is very bad. Remember that the Constitution had to be sent back for a 'do-over' to add the Bill of Rights back in 1787. This included the right to Habeas Corpus review. Obama's DOJ, like Bush's DOJ is just tossing the pillars upon which the country is built -- what makes the United States a special place. This is what Senator Obama said in September 2006 on the floor of the Senate: The bottom line is this: Current procedures under the CSRT are such that a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut the Government's case and has no way of proving his innocence. I would like somebody in this Chamber, somebody in this Government, to tell me why this is necessary. I do not want to hear that this is a new world and we face a new kind of enemy. I know that. . . . But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of my family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent to Guantanamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were being held and being able to prove their innocence.\" I know you are not supposed to live links so go to salon.com and click on Glen Greenwald's link for a lot more information and links to these court cases where the Obama DOJ makes a mockery of everything we stand for.

One thing that seems to apply here is that the Supreme Court (or a lower court) can say \"A\" and the Administration can file a motion or whatever and that makes it drag on foe 1-2 more years. The Bush Administration held an American citizen for 3.5 years with no charges and no trial.

He is not. \"Back in February, the Obama administration shocked many civil libertarians by filing a brief in federal court that, in two sentences, declared that it embraced the most extremist Bush theory on this issue -- the Obama DOJ argued, as The New York Times's Charlie Savage put it, \"that military detainees in Afghanistan have no legal right to challenge their imprisonment there, embracing a key argument of former President Bush\u2019s legal team.\" Remember: these are not prisoners captured in Afghanistan on a battlefield. Many of them have nothing to do with Afghanistan and were captured far, far away from that country -- abducted from their homes and workplaces -- and then flown to Bagram to be imprisoned. Indeed, the Bagram detainees in the particular case in which the Obama DOJ filed its brief were Yemenis and Tunisians captured outside of Afghanistan (in Thailand or the UAE, for instance) and then flown to Bagram and locked away there as much as six years without any charges. That is what the Obama DOJ defended, and they argued that those individuals can be imprisoned indefinitely with no rights of any kind -- as long as they are kept in Bagram rather than Guantanamo. Last month, a federal judge emphatically rejected the Bush/Obama position and held that the rationale of Boudemiene applies every bit as much to Bagram as it does to Guantanamo. Notably, the district judge who so ruled -- John Bates -- is an appointee of George W. Bush, a former Whitewater prosecutor, and a very pro-executive-power judge. In his decision (.pdf), Judge Bates made clear how identical are the constitutional rights of detainees flown to Guantanamo and Bagram and underscored how dangerous is the Bush/Obama claim that the President has the right to abduct people from around the world and imprison them at Bagram with no due process of any kind.\" This is very bad. Remember that the Constitution had to be sent back for a 'do-over' to add the Bill of Rights back in 1787. This included the right to Habeas Corpus review. Obama's DOJ, like Bush's DOJ is just tossing the pillars upon which the country is built -- what makes the United States a special place. This is what Senator Obama said in September 2006 on the floor of the Senate: The bottom line is this: Current procedures under the CSRT are such that a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut the Government's case and has no way of proving his innocence. I would like somebody in this Chamber, somebody in this Government, to tell me why this is necessary. I do not want to hear that this is a new world and we face a new kind of enemy. I know that. . . . But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of my family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent to Guantanamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were being held and being able to prove their innocence.\" I know you are not supposed to live links so go to salon.com and click on Glen Greenwald's link for a lot more information and links to these court cases where the Obama DOJ makes a mockery of everything we stand for.

Indeed, the Bagram detainees in the particular case in which the Obama DOJ filed its brief were Yemenis and Tunisians captured outside of Afghanistan (in Thailand or the UAE, for instance) and then flown to Bagram and locked away there as much as six years without any charges. That is what the Obama DOJ defended, and they argued that those individuals can be imprisoned indefinitely with no rights of any kind -- as long as they are kept in Bagram rather than Guantanamo. Last month, a federal judge emphatically rejected the Bush/Obama position and held that the rationale of Boudemiene applies every bit as much to Bagram as it does to Guantanamo. Notably, the district judge who so ruled -- John Bates -- is an appointee of George W. Bush, a former Whitewater prosecutor, and a very pro-executive-power judge. In his decision (.pdf), Judge Bates made clear how identical are the constitutional rights of detainees flown to Guantanamo and Bagram and underscored how dangerous is the Bush/Obama claim that the President has the right to abduct people from around the world and imprison them at Bagram with no due process of any kind.\" This is very bad. Remember that the Constitution had to be sent back for a 'do-over' to add the Bill of Rights back in 1787. This included the right to Habeas Corpus review. Obama's DOJ, like Bush's DOJ is just tossing the pillars upon which the country is built -- what makes the United States a special place. This is what Senator Obama said in September 2006 on the floor of the Senate: The bottom line is this: Current procedures under the CSRT are such that a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut the Government's case and has no way of proving his innocence. I would like somebody in this Chamber, somebody in this Government, to tell me why this is necessary. I do not want to hear that this is a new world and we face a new kind of enemy. I know that. . . . But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of my family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent to Guantanamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were being held and being able to prove their innocence.\" I know you are not supposed to live links so go to salon.com and click on Glen Greenwald's link for a lot more information and links to these court cases where the Obama DOJ makes a mockery of everything we stand for.

One thing that seems to apply here is that the Supreme Court (or a lower court) can say \"A\" and the Administration can file a motion or whatever and that makes it drag on foe 1-2 more years. The Bush Administration held an American citizen for 3.5 years with no charges and no trial. They did it by stringing out in the courts by denying a what is clearly required in the Bill of Rights -- a speedy and public trial.

The Witch Hunters will continue though until they either a) discover they were wrong all along or b) get hunted down, convicted with little to no justice and then with a dumb look on their faces, wonder why? As for Obama, The courts rule allot on this stuff now that W opened room for the civil authorities to get involved. Had W set up a legal system utilizing the military ranks that was fair and just to handle whoever was taken into custody, all of this could have been avoided. How dumb of these so called \"college educated buffoons\". If nothing else at least you have the chance to whine about W a little bit more Like we don't read whining about how it's Obama's fault everyday. Paint the whole picture, not just your partisan propaganda.",

Many of them have nothing to do with Afghanistan and were captured far, far away from that country -- abducted from their homes and workplaces -- and then flown to Bagram to be imprisoned.

That is what the Obama DOJ defended, and they argued that those individuals can be imprisoned indefinitely with no rights of any kind -- as long as they are kept in Bagram rather than Guantanamo. Last month, a federal judge emphatically rejected the Bush/Obama position and held that the rationale of Boudemiene applies every bit as much to Bagram as it does to Guantanamo.

No judge is going to be the one to suspend a law that's been in effect since Roman times!! One thing that seems to apply here is that the Supreme Court (or a lower court) can say \"A\" and the Administration can file a motion or whatever and that makes it drag on foe 1-2 more years. The Bush Administration held an American citizen for 3.5 years with no charges and no trial. They did it by stringing out in the courts by denying a what is clearly required in the Bill of Rights -- a speedy and public trial. This really does apply: \"In Germany, they came first for the Communists, And I didn\u2019t speak up because I wasn\u2019t a Communist; And then they came for the trade unionists, And I didn\u2019t speak up because I wasn\u2019t a trade unionist; And then they came for the Jews, And I didn\u2019t speak up because I wasn\u2019t a Jew; And then . . . they came for me . . .
