According to the Human Rights Campaign, the e-mail was sent to at least one LDS ward in Illinois and was authorized by a bishop named Chris Church. \"The messaging in the e-mail carries many of the same bigoted lies that were hallmarks of the LDS Church\u2019s campaign in support of Proposition 8 in California and Proposition 102 in Arizona,\" according to an HRC press release. \"The e-mail misleads citizens in Illinois by blatantly misstating that the civil unions legislation would 'empower the public schools to begin teaching this lifestyle to our young children regardless of parental requests otherwise.'

I've spent the last few years listening to die-hard Righties whining and ranting that they don't want the gays forcing the \"gay lifestyle\" on them, yet here they are, trying to force their ultra-conservative religiously restrictive lifestyle on everyone. No gay person has ever (except as a tongue-in-cheek joke) said that other people ought to \"become gay,\" nor has any gay person tried to force the \"gay lifestyle\" (and I use that term sardonically) on anyone else. However, the very people who complain about the concept of \"forcing the lifestyle\" on others are the ones who actually ARE forcing their lifestyle on other people. And now, not only do they want to control other people's lives in their own state, but they want to push their religious views on OTHER sovereign states. Seriously, the irony is just too much.",
