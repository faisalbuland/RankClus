For a guy that wanted to be President so bad he sure doesn't seem to like anything about this country, or his wife till now for that matter. Think about it, OUR PRESIDENT BAD MOUTHED US, THE CITIZENS HE REPRESENTS, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. More blame America First. Maybe he is in campaign mode again, going on for President of the NWO? What a sell-out. I don't care what your beliefs are,there is something going on with this. Bows to sponsors of anti-Americanism, Olive Branch to terrorist organizations vowing the destruction of the West (us), bad mouthing America as the root of all that is wrong in the world. Not letting banks repay money to get out of Gov control, legislation to take control and/or shut down the internet.

Maybe Arrogant comes from going all over the world every time there is trouble while Europe Sends usually token forces or supplies? Maybe Arrogance comes from giving more money to charity from Private Citizens than the value of many countries GDP? Maybe Arrogance comes from taking care of our citizens, Mexico-Central-and South American refugees from their impoverished and/or greedy leadership. Maybe Arrogance comes from being on the moon, creating more in our short couple centuries than Europe did in millennia. Maybe it come in the way our immigrants (legal ones anyway) assimilate here, yet riot and burn neighborhoods in France and plot to blow up planes with their babies in Britain. Maybe it is Arrogance in that we have a lower crime rate per capita than many countries that don\u2019t allow a version of our 2nd Amendment. Maybe it is Arrogance in KNOWING that for all the whining, crying, finger pointing, and hating America, when Crap-Hits-The \u2013Fan who is it the world calls on to spend their wealth, give their supplies and to bleed and maybe die\u2026..Americans. It isn\u2019t the US government that fights and gives to the troubled parts of the world\u2026.It is the America People. So if Obama can\u2019t handle that, he can resign anytime he decides this country, Its People, and Its Ideals are too much for him\u2026.. I think tomorrow would be a good day to get more ammo. ...for what? When this country falls apart into the 3rd World nation O wants us to be, to protect my family.

Maybe Arrogant comes from going all over the world every time there is trouble while Europe Sends usually token forces or supplies? Maybe Arrogance comes from giving more money to charity from Private Citizens than the value of many countries GDP? Maybe Arrogance comes from taking care of our citizens, Mexico-Central-and South American refugees from their impoverished and/or greedy leadership. Maybe Arrogance comes from being on the moon, creating more in our short couple centuries than Europe did in millennia. Maybe it come in the way our immigrants (legal ones anyway) assimilate here, yet riot and burn neighborhoods in France and plot to blow up planes with their babies in Britain.

That was republican members of congress that 'banned' french fries. You're a day late and a dollar short. Because of what france did, congress changed the name in the congress cafeteria after bringing the french arrogance up on the congress floor from \"french fries\" to \"freedom fries\". Do a google to bring yourself up to at least, what, ten years ago? LOL...are you confused? Because France didn't agree with our invasion of iraq, you call that arrogant?

For a guy that wanted to be President so bad he sure doesn't seem to like anything about this country, or his wife till now for that matter. Think about it, OUR PRESIDENT BAD MOUTHED US, THE CITIZENS HE REPRESENTS, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. More blame America First. Maybe he is in campaign mode again, going on for President of the NWO? What a sell-out. I don't care what your beliefs are,there is something going on with this. Bows to sponsors of anti-Americanism, Olive Branch to terrorist organizations vowing the destruction of the West (us), bad mouthing America as the root of all that is wrong in the world.

        "content": "Gee, I wonder what happens when the speech is posted in context: In recent years we've allowed our Alliance to drift. I know that there have been honest disagreements over policy, but we also know that there's something more that has crept into our relationship. In America, there's a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.

Think about it, OUR PRESIDENT BAD MOUTHED US, THE CITIZENS HE REPRESENTS, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. More blame America First. Maybe he is in campaign mode again, going on for President of the NWO? What a sell-out. I don't care what your beliefs are,there is something going on with this. Bows to sponsors of anti-Americanism, Olive Branch to terrorist organizations vowing the destruction of the West (us), bad mouthing America as the root of all that is wrong in the world. Not letting banks repay money to get out of Gov control, legislation to take control and/or shut down the internet. (They want to be able to look into any ones online activity, where are all the Bush wire tap whiners on this?) Firing people in private companies, wanting limited pay in private companies. West Wing Aides got millions for brokering Bail-out deals, no outrage. All these corrupted appointees. What is going on with this guy? How can some people keep blowing all this off as nothing? Maybe Arrogant comes from going all over the world every time there is trouble while Europe Sends usually token forces or supplies? Maybe Arrogance comes from giving more money to charity from Private Citizens than the value of many countries GDP? Maybe Arrogance comes from taking care of our citizens, Mexico-Central-and South American refugees from their impoverished and/or greedy leadership. Maybe Arrogance comes from being on the moon, creating more in our short couple centuries than Europe did in millennia. Maybe it come in the way our immigrants (legal ones anyway) assimilate here, yet riot and burn neighborhoods in France and plot to blow up planes with their babies in Britain. Maybe it is Arrogance in that we have a lower crime rate per capita than many countries that don\u2019t allow a version of our 2nd Amendment. Maybe it is Arrogance in KNOWING that for all the whining, crying, finger pointing, and hating America, when Crap-Hits-The \u2013Fan who is it the world calls on to spend their wealth, give their supplies and to bleed and maybe die\u2026..Americans. It isn\u2019t the US government that fights and gives to the troubled parts of the world\u2026.It is the America People. So if Obama can\u2019t handle that, he can resign anytime he decides this country, Its People, and Its Ideals are too much for him\u2026.. I think tomorrow would be a good day to get more ammo.

What's obvious is what he says that you take as what you want to hear. If anyone spent any amount of years in europe, europeans lead the way in arrogance, especially the french. Remember the banning of \"french\" fries? That's just one example. They made it pretty clear a few years back about how the anglo language was polluting the french language and how even speaking anglo was against the french culture. What? That was republican members of congress that 'banned' french fries. You're a day late and a dollar short. Because of what france did, congress changed the name in the congress cafeteria after bringing the french arrogance up on the congress floor from \"french fries\" to \"freedom fries\". Do a google to bring yourself up to at least, what, ten years ago? LOL...are you confused? Because France didn't agree with our invasion of iraq, you call that arrogant? You think congress banned french fries because \"the anglo language was polluting the french language?\" I think YOU need google.",

For a guy that wanted to be President so bad he sure doesn't seem to like anything about this country, or his wife till now for that matter. Think about it, OUR PRESIDENT BAD MOUTHED US, THE CITIZENS HE REPRESENTS, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. More blame America First. Maybe he is in campaign mode again, going on for President of the NWO? What a sell-out. I don't care what your beliefs are,there is something going on with this. Bows to sponsors of anti-Americanism, Olive Branch to terrorist organizations vowing the destruction of the West (us), bad mouthing America as the root of all that is wrong in the world. Not letting banks repay money to get out of Gov control, legislation to take control and/or shut down the internet. (They want to be able to look into any ones online activity, where are all the Bush wire tap whiners on this?) Firing people in private companies, wanting limited pay in private companies. West Wing Aides got millions for brokering Bail-out deals, no outrage. All these corrupted appointees. What is going on with this guy? How can some people keep blowing all this off as nothing? Maybe Arrogant comes from going all over the world every time there is trouble while Europe Sends usually token forces or supplies? Maybe Arrogance comes from giving more money to charity from Private Citizens than the value of many countries GDP? Maybe Arrogance comes from taking care of our citizens, Mexico-Central-and South American refugees from their impoverished and/or greedy leadership. Maybe Arrogance comes from being on the moon, creating more in our short couple centuries than Europe did in millennia. Maybe it come in the way our immigrants (legal ones anyway) assimilate here, yet riot and burn neighborhoods in France and plot to blow up planes with their babies in Britain.

He blamed US, instead of Mexico, their military (whom has deserted in astonishing numbers), the cartels, and so on. So now, Obama wants to disarm us, while other countries are looking to increase their arsenals. There is a reason for us maintaining our nuclear arsenal. It is called deterrence. Does he think that if he disarms us, everyone else will follow? It will only make us more vulnerable. The man needs to step into reality. NK just fired a missile. The words he used weren't strong. Rather, it was a weak scolding. When Reagan told Gorbachev to \"tear down this wall\"...was he there blaming previous administrations, trying to apologize and so on? Hell no. When he inherited a horrible economy, did he sit there, crying about Carter? No, he took action. Blaming and so on was handled at the debates. Now we have an administration that is blaming us for the worlds problems, instead of dealing with them. Or, they choose to deal with them trying to restrict our rights. That is a bunch of BS. How some of you can stand for it is beyond me.",
