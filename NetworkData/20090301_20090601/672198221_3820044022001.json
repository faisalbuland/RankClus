First you'll get a Medical Board and let's say you are so bad they give you a 40% Disability Rating and put you out under the Temporary Disabled Retired List. You will get 50% of base pay while on this list. I got rated by the VA with a 40% Disability for the same thing. Then you will get a physical around the 18 month mark to see if you have changed. It's kind of a sham inspection as the Air Force does not use the Veterans Affairs Disability Schedules, they make their own rating. They will come back with a ruling of 20% and removal from the Retired List with severance pay to see if you appeal, even though you are rated 40% by the VA. You appeal and they come back with 30%. Sick of the whole process you sign the damn form and send it back. To your surprise you shortly receive Retirement orders with a 40% disability rating. Oh my god, the Air Force grew a heart or actually followed the VA disability schedules. Your Retirement check is $300 from the Air Force. That's it. There's a law that says you can't receive VA Disability AND retirement so since you get $600 from the VA for disability they deduct that from your \"retirement\". About a year and a half later you receive a letter saying they error'ed in your retirement and \"\"heres your new Amended retirement orders, for 30%\"\". Doing so, now you would have been eligible to only receive $90 from the Air Force as a \"retirement\" check. Guess what? They say they overpaid you then and now want the money back plus interest. The sum they figured YOU owe them is $5000 and since your puny \"retirement\" check is only $90 now....it till take until beyond 2019 to pay them back. Well this isn't so bad right? You were just operated on for that disability by Veterans Affairs and they made you worse. Guess what? VA will raise your disability rating and in doing so....you won't get a DOD \"retirement\" check anymore. So the question I have is which collections agency will DFAS use to collect an \"overpayment\" because of this ordeal? It would never have happened if the Air Force used the VA Disability Schedule. I thought they did hence the retirement orders for 40%. I know I'm not the only one that's been hosed. Don't break your back for your country. Don't think the DOD Disability Retirement system will help you, it won't. Anyone with similiar stories shoot me an email. For you young folks in the military, get AFLAC disability insurance. You ain't going to get squat if you don't, well not enough to support yourself let alone a family. The DOD Chapter 61 Disability Retirement Program needs to be abolished with the removal of Executive Order 10122. That would put the VA back in control of the program, and end the Air Force/other services low balling broken Americans and ......making them PAY to be Disability RETIRED.",

Congress is allowing the military departments to ignore Veterans Affairs Disability Ratings in regards to Chapter 61 Disability Retirements.

The American people keep driving around with those yellow 'support the troops' decals on their cars but they are allowing American military members to be broken and screwed over. Abolishing Executive Order 10122 would put this program back into Veterans Affairs and put Veterans Affairs back into the business of taking care of service injured Veterans instead of the welfare system of giving away healthcare benefits that are not service connected for millions of Americans and Phillipino's. Congress gave $200 million to the Phillipines for WWII Phillipino Veterans in the Stimulus Bill. Why do they give so much attention to non-Americans than the Americans they are breaking and hosing over? It's more than Bush and Obama. Congress is allowing this to happen. Matter of fact they approved of money for non-Americans instead of spending time thinking about the Americans they are breaking.",
