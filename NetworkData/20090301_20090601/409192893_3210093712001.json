Mr. Buffett is shopping for bargains while the share prices of most companies are sliding \u2014 his own portfolio included. quote: The stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed, history-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors,\u201d he wrote. He went on: \u201cThese parties looked at loss experience over periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then made this experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had recently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn\u2019t afford.\u201d Also blissfully ignored, he wrote, were the perils of relying on mathematical models devised without worst-case situations in mind.
