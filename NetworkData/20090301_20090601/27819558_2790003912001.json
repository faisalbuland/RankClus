        "content": "Gay Rights Achieve Victories in Delaware The Delaware legislature delivered two victories for gay rights on Thursday, rejecting a proposed same-sex marriage ban and approving a bill to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation -- though not gender identity. The senate voted 11-9 to reject a constitutional amendment that would have banned gay marriage in the state. The ban was viewed as overreaching, with the potential to affect future efforts to create civil unions in the state. In addition, the house voted 26-14 in favor of a bill that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment, public works contracting, public accommodations, and insurance. The bill does not, however, prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. Similar nondiscrimination legislation has passed the house previously and died without a vote each time in the senate. A change in senate rules makes it more likely that the bill will come to a vote this year. >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid76621.asp",
