Don't they know that once LGBT folks get hitched, we act just like heterosexual married couples and stop having sex after the honeymoon is over!!!.. Well, it starts tapering off as a once-a-week thing and graduates to once-a-year if your lucky.. Personally, sex is way over-rated. I'd rather be fishing. Of course I'm no spring chicken any longer and fishing is less taxing on the body (BG).. That \"broad-based coalition\" has it all backward, they should be praying for us to get hitched if they are truly interested in seeing us stop sinning.",
