I know that we can tell a lot of the time if they are trolls, but some have been way off the mark lately. Please do not jump on the posters and help them as you would have liked help when you were knew to here. We have the wire thread to post beliefs about a possible troll. We have the other threads that are posted on every hour to use to let others know that you belief a troll in the wire. Please contact me or another Moderator and we will handle it.
