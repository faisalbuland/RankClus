Then I was going to write how the President had appointed a guy to run an outfit named 'Director of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers,' but I thought the 'and Workers' part was too obvious even for Barack Obama, so that wasn't going to work as an April Fool's prank. I mean, don't Workers count as part of the Community of Autos? Or did someone want to make certain that the UAW and the AFL-CIO understood they were going to be actually running the Auto Communities ere long? Next I thought I might write a joke item about how 'Health and Human Services nominee Kathleen Sebelius recently corrected three years of tax returns and paid more than $7,000 in back taxes after finding \"unintentional errors.\"' The funny part was going to be a when I reported that the Associated Press headlined her appearance before a Senate Subcommittee as part of her confirmation process: 'HHS nominee calls for health care fraud crackdown.' But who would believe that on the same day she admitted to missing by $7,000 on her taxes she would have the chutzpah to say she wanted to, 'send the signal that there's a new sheriff in town.' No one would believe that, so I couldn't use it as part of my April Fool's Day column. ... Finally, ending up where we started with the car companies, I watched the press conference by the Obama-appointed Chairman of GM, Fritz Henderson claiming that GM would cover up to nine months of car payments for people who bought a GM vehicle then lost their job. I thought that had to be an early April Fool's joke. Where would Fritz Henderson get the money to do that? I mean, that would be just about as funny as giving mortgages to people to buy houses who... Oh. Wait a minute. You mean my tax dollars -- already going to people who bought houses they couldn't afford -- are now going to go to people who buy cars they can't afford? Looks like the joke's on me.\" --political analyst Rich Galen",
