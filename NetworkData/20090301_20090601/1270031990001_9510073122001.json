Near the beginning of this particular broadcast, you stated that people do not have a right to freedom FROM religion. That is one place I would disagree with you - with a caveat. IMO, people DO have a right to be free from religion also - meaning from a governmental preference for religion vs no religion. (It does not mean that other people do not have a right to have their own beliefs as long as they don't push it on those who do not wish it.) That is where I believe there is freedom FROM religion. What do you think regarding this? This ties into what you were saying, I believe, when you referenced the incident in Iraq where the SPC wished to have a MAAF meeting that was interrupted by Maj Welborne, who threatened them with UCMJ, for being atheists, if they did not break up the meeting or if they held another meeting.",

The religious are supposed to keep quiet under this onslaught!! So I am of the opinion that the courtesy can be returned from time to time.

A cross look or comment about being hellbound or other such nonsense is what has given so many a bad name as evangelists.

The toughest thing to teach and make stick, was that if the phone didn't ring, that was O.K. too!!! Some times new people would come to church because we were always busy and they would come from curiosity, if nothing else! It was quite a little church and the lights were on every night as there was always some thing going on. People from several towns around us always comment on it. And so it goes!!

As you heard me say, I didn't spare the horses when calling down that incident, as well as other offensive practices of the religious, and the abuses of subordinates by superiors. You probably noticed the caller had a hard time recognising that it IS a problem for Christians in that when we see wrongs they must be pointed out and corrected swiftly by US not those outside the churches. This kind of thinking as I mentioned almost has destroyed the Catholic church and by extension, has damaged ALL churches in the U.S. and elsewhere. We can't worry about maintaining the edifice, we must care for the mission and the people within the church, and in the community, that we have a responsibility to.

        "content": "Hi Bruce, Yes, I tend to agree with your statements. A moment of silence is not bad, as long as it is not intended to promote religion over non-religion. During that moment of quiet people are free to do as they wish\u2026pray, meditate, do puzzles, study, etc. Unfortunately, in some places, that was the intent, to promote religion. In those cases, where it went to court, it was found unconstitutional. And true, a simple no thank you should suffice when someone offers their religious beliefs. I believe the problem arises when one, or the other, will not take a simple no for an answer. When one person keeps pushing, something is bound to give one way or the other. Unfortunately that is not always the case. I remember one duty station there one individual who even verbalized that he did not even want to know who was not christian, because he did not feel that he could be impartial if he knew. That is where some of our current problems arise. Some people are not willing to live and let live. What does it matter is someone has a different belief than yours, after all? Believe, or don\u2019t believe, what you will. Thanks, also, for taking that opinion on the Maj Welborne incident. IMO it was despicable for him to act in such a manner. Personally, I don\u2019t give a darn what your religion (or lack of) is, you still have the freedom to believe as you please. For him to have threatened the individuals, as was reported, was wholly inappropriate and a violation of EO. He did not have to attend the meeting, if he did not wish. Same as we are not required to attend a religious service, if we do not wish. I think that some people take it the wrong way when I say that I am for freedom FROM religion also. Some believe that to mean that I oppose religion, which I do not. What it means is that I am against the imposition of any belief, or lack of belief, on anyone by any governmental body/person. Government, as a body, is supposed to be neutral on that aspect. This message has been edited. Last edited by: DragonRider01, Sat 25 June 2011 08:09 AM",
