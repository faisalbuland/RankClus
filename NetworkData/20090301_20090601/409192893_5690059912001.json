'http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123897492702491091.html#printMode' Education Secretary Arne Duncan did a public service last week when he visited New York City and spoke up for charter schools and mayoral control of education. That was the reformer talking. The status quo Mr. Duncan was on display last month when he let Congress kill a District of Columbia voucher program even as he was sitting on evidence of its success. <edit> In New York City with its 1.1 million students, mayoral control has resulted in better test scores and graduation rates, while expanding charter schools, which means more and better education choices for low-income families. But mayoral control expires in June unless state lawmakers renew it, and the United Federation of Teachers is working with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to weaken or kill it. President Obama's stimulus is sending some $100 billion to the nation's school districts. What will he demand in return? The state budget passed by the New York legislature last week freezes funding for charters but increases it by more that $400 million for other public schools. Perhaps a visit to a charter school in Harlem would help Mr. Obama honor his reform pledge. \"I'm looking at the data here in front of me,\" Mr. Duncan told the New York Post. \"Graduation rates are up. Test scores are up. Teacher salaries are up. Social promotion was eliminated. Dramatically increasing parental choice. That's real progress.\" Mr. Duncan's help in New York is in stark contrast to his department's decision to sit on a performance review of the D.C. voucher program while Congress debated its future in March. The latest annual evaluation was finally released Friday, and it shows measurable academic gains. The Opportunity Scholarship Program provides $7,500 vouchers to 1,700 low-income families in D.C. to send their children to private schools. Ninety-nine percent of the children are black or Hispanic, and there are more than four applicants for each scholarship. The 2008 report demonstrated progress among certain subgroups of children but not everyone. This year's report shows statistically significant academic gains for the entire voucher-receiving population. Children attending private schools with the aid of the scholarships are reading nearly a half-grade ahead of their peers who did not receive vouchers. Voucher recipients are doing no better in math but they're doing no worse. Which means that no voucher participant is in worse academic shape than before, and many students are much better off. \"There are transition difficulties, a culture shock upon entering a school where you're expected to pay attention, learn, do homework,\" says Jay Greene, an education scholar at the Manhattan Institute. \"But these results fit a pattern that we've seen in other evaluations of vouchers. Benefits compound over time.\" It's bad enough that Democrats are killing a program that parents love and is closing the achievement gap between poor minorities and whites. But as scandalous is that the Education Department almost certainly knew the results of this evaluation for months. Voucher recipients were tested last spring. The scores were analyzed in the late summer and early fall, and in November preliminary results were presented to a team of advisers who work with the Education Department to produce the annual evaluation. Since Education officials are intimately involved in this process, they had to know what was in this evaluation even as Democrats passed (and Mr. Obama signed) language that ends the program after next year. Opponents of school choice for poor children have long claimed they'd support vouchers if there was evidence that they work. While running for President last year, Mr. Obama told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that if he saw more proof that they were successful, he would \"not allow my predisposition to stand in the way of making sure that our kids can learn . . . You do what works for the kids.\" Except, apparently, when what works is opposed by unions. Mr. Duncan's office spurned our repeated calls and emails asking what and when he and his aides knew about these results. We do know the Administration prohibited anyone involved with the evaluation from discussing it publicly. You'd think we were talking about nuclear secrets, not about a taxpayer-funded pilot program. A reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Duncan's department didn't want proof of voucher success to interfere with Senator Dick Durbin's campaign to kill vouchers at the behest of the teachers unions. The decision to let 1,700 poor kids get tossed from private schools is a moral disgrace. It also exposes the ugly politics that lies beneath union and liberal efforts across the country to undermine mayoral control, charter schools, vouchers or any reform that threatens their monopoly over public education dollars and jobs. The Sheldon Silver-Dick Durbin Democrats aren't worried that school choice doesn't work. They're worried that it does, and if Messrs. Obama and Duncan want to succeed as reformers they need to say so consistently.",

        "content": "I am a public school teacher and I think that parents should be given the choice with vouchers. (Actually I have worked at both private and public schools.) It is awful that some children have no choice other than to attend schools where they worry every minute, for their own safety. Why force these kids to continue going to these schools? People just assume that every private school is just going to take these vouchers. With vouchers come accountability and government intrusion into the private school system. The private Catholic school where I taught would not be so quick to take this option. The school has it's rules and requirements. If you didn't want to be there you could leave. The school didn't have to take everyone. If a student disrupted the school and the students, the parents would be asked to find another place to educate that student. We also had students of other faiths enrolled in our school, and it was not the school's purpose to indoctrinate them into its faith. (Actually I had more religious harassment at the public school I had left prior to teaching at the private school.) Also, think logistics....how will these new students get to a private school? Not every community has a local private school and how would the student get to school. I just can't see every private school investing in mass transportation nor every parent able to drive these children to school across a city. Would the vouchers cover the cost of the transportation, too? Will the vouchers cover the cost of uniforms? Class supplies? The parents at private school do not grumble about the fact that they have to provide their children with pencils, pens, notebooks, lab fees, etc. It is expected and generally stated in the enrollment application. Oh, and remember, not all who send their children to private or parochial schools are rich. Many families make great sacrifices to make this education available to their children; but it is a matter of choice. In another post, someone mentioned that private schools can educate children much cheaper. This may well be the case. In our private school, parents would volunteer to clean (didn't have to hire a janitorial service). Need an electrician.....oh so and so's dad will help out. We had parents and some students that worked over the summer to sand and varnish all old hardwood floors of the elementary building. The school raised money to pay for the supplies and equipment needed. They did a beautiful job. The students took ownership of their facility and due to this no graffiti or property damage. Of course, there were some students that would also get to clean the bathroom or hallway with a toothbrush.

Yes, and many teachers work for much less because the working conditions are often times more desirable than some public schools, as well as class size much smaller. Students are for the most part polite and are there to learn. Now that is not to say that ALL public schools are less desirable than a public school. Right now I teach in a very nice public school that is in a higher socio-economic area with a majority of college educated parents. Parents are involved in their child's education and have high expectations. Communication is done readily by email and grades are all on-line. Vouchers would not take away our student population. Maybe, the real problem, is with those schools that have no control, have huge student populations (in which students have to have security and metal detectors), and have no discipline/high expectations.

        "reply": "I am a public school teacher and I think that parents should be given the choice with vouchers. (Actually I have worked at both private and public schools.) It is awful that some children have no choice other than to attend schools where they worry every minute, for their own safety. Why force these kids to continue going to these schools? People just assume that every private school is just going to take these vouchers. With vouchers come accountability and government intrusion into the private school system. The private Catholic school where I taught would not be so quick to take this option. The school has it's rules and requirements. If you didn't want to be there you could leave. The school didn't have to take everyone. If a student disrupted the school and the students, the parents would be asked to find another place to educate that student. We also had students of other faiths enrolled in our school, and it was not the school's purpose to indoctrinate them into its faith. (Actually I had more religious harassment at the public school I had left prior to teaching at the private school.) Also, think logistics....how will these new students get to a private school? Not every community has a local private school and how would the student get to school.

'http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123897492702491091.html#printMode' Education Secretary Arne Duncan did a public service last week when he visited New York City and spoke up for charter schools and mayoral control of education. That was the reformer talking. The status quo Mr. Duncan was on display last month when he let Congress kill a District of Columbia voucher program even as he was sitting on evidence of its success. <edit> In New York City with its 1.1 million students, mayoral control has resulted in better test scores and graduation rates, while expanding charter schools, which means more and better education choices for low-income families. But mayoral control expires in June unless state lawmakers renew it, and the United Federation of Teachers is working with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to weaken or kill it. President Obama's stimulus is sending some $100 billion to the nation's school districts. What will he demand in return? The state budget passed by the New York legislature last week freezes funding for charters but increases it by more that $400 million for other public schools. Perhaps a visit to a charter school in Harlem would help Mr. Obama honor his reform pledge. \"I'm looking at the data here in front of me,\" Mr. Duncan told the New York Post. \"Graduation rates are up. Test scores are up. Teacher salaries are up. Social promotion was eliminated. Dramatically increasing parental choice. That's real progress.\" Mr. Duncan's help in New York is in stark contrast to his department's decision to sit on a performance review of the D.C. voucher program while Congress debated its future in March. The latest annual evaluation was finally released Friday, and it shows measurable academic gains. The Opportunity Scholarship Program provides $7,500 vouchers to 1,700 low-income families in D.C. to send their children to private schools. Ninety-nine percent of the children are black or Hispanic, and there are more than four applicants for each scholarship. The 2008 report demonstrated progress among certain subgroups of children but not everyone. This year's report shows statistically significant academic gains for the entire voucher-receiving population. Children attending private schools with the aid of the scholarships are reading nearly a half-grade ahead of their peers who did not receive vouchers. Voucher recipients are doing no better in math but they're doing no worse. Which means that no voucher participant is in worse academic shape than before, and many students are much better off. \"There are transition difficulties, a culture shock upon entering a school where you're expected to pay attention, learn, do homework,\" says Jay Greene, an education scholar at the Manhattan Institute. \"But these results fit a pattern that we've seen in other evaluations of vouchers. Benefits compound over time.\" It's bad enough that Democrats are killing a program that parents love and is closing the achievement gap between poor minorities and whites. But as scandalous is that the Education Department almost certainly knew the results of this evaluation for months. Voucher recipients were tested last spring. The scores were analyzed in the late summer and early fall, and in November preliminary results were presented to a team of advisers who work with the Education Department to produce the annual evaluation. Since Education officials are intimately involved in this process, they had to know what was in this evaluation even as Democrats passed (and Mr. Obama signed) language that ends the program after next year. Opponents of school choice for poor children have long claimed they'd support vouchers if there was evidence that they work. While running for President last year, Mr. Obama told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that if he saw more proof that they were successful, he would \"not allow my predisposition to stand in the way of making sure that our kids can learn . . . You do what works for the kids.\" Except, apparently, when what works is opposed by unions. Mr. Duncan's office spurned our repeated calls and emails asking what and when he and his aides knew about these results. We do know the Administration prohibited anyone involved with the evaluation from discussing it publicly. You'd think we were talking about nuclear secrets, not about a taxpayer-funded pilot program. A reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Duncan's department didn't want proof of voucher success to interfere with Senator Dick Durbin's campaign to kill vouchers at the behest of the teachers unions. The decision to let 1,700 poor kids get tossed from private schools is a moral disgrace. It also exposes the ugly politics that lies beneath union and liberal efforts across the country to undermine mayoral control, charter schools, vouchers or any reform that threatens their monopoly over public education dollars and jobs. The Sheldon Silver-Dick Durbin Democrats aren't worried that school choice doesn't work. They're worried that it does, and if Messrs.

It is awful that some children have no choice other than to attend schools where they worry every minute, for their own safety. Why force these kids to continue going to these schools? People just assume that every private school is just going to take these vouchers. With vouchers come accountability and government intrusion into the private school system. The private Catholic school where I taught would not be so quick to take this option. The school has it's rules and requirements. If you didn't want to be there you could leave. The school didn't have to take everyone. If a student disrupted the school and the students, the parents would be asked to find another place to educate that student. We also had students of other faiths enrolled in our school, and it was not the school's purpose to indoctrinate them into its faith. (Actually I had more religious harassment at the public school I had left prior to teaching at the private school.) Also, think logistics....how will these new students get to a private school? Not every community has a local private school and how would the student get to school. I just can't see every private school investing in mass transportation nor every parent able to drive these children to school across a city. Would the vouchers cover the cost of the transportation, too? Will the vouchers cover the cost of uniforms? Class supplies? The parents at private school do not grumble about the fact that they have to provide their children with pencils, pens, notebooks, lab fees, etc. It is expected and generally stated in the enrollment application. Oh, and remember, not all who send their children to private or parochial schools are rich. Many families make great sacrifices to make this education available to their children; but it is a matter of choice. In another post, someone mentioned that private schools can educate children much cheaper. This may well be the case. In our private school, parents would volunteer to clean (didn't have to hire a janitorial service). Need an electrician.....oh so and so's dad will help out. We had parents and some students that worked over the summer to sand and varnish all old hardwood floors of the elementary building. The school raised money to pay for the supplies and equipment needed. They did a beautiful job. The students took ownership of their facility and due to this no graffiti or property damage. Of course, there were some students that would also get to clean the bathroom or hallway with a toothbrush. (Parental support) So after a few times, these students, too, began to care about the appearance of the school. Yes, and many teachers work for much less because the working conditions are often times more desirable than some public schools, as well as class size much smaller. Students are for the most part polite and are there to learn. Now that is not to say that ALL public schools are less desirable than a public school. Right now I teach in a very nice public school that is in a higher socio-economic area with a majority of college educated parents. Parents are involved in their child's education and have high expectations. Communication is done readily by email and grades are all on-line. Vouchers would not take away our student population. Maybe, the real problem, is with those schools that have no control, have huge student populations (in which students have to have security and metal detectors), and have no discipline/high expectations. Perhaps reducing school size would be a part of the answer. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",

They can choose the best students, the public school is left with the rest, then the public schools get less money to educate those students the voucher and charter schools deem as undesirable but now with less resources because their resources have been siphoned off for vouchers and charter campuses.

'http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123897492702491091.html#printMode' Education Secretary Arne Duncan did a public service last week when he visited New York City and spoke up for charter schools and mayoral control of education. That was the reformer talking. The status quo Mr. Duncan was on display last month when he let Congress kill a District of Columbia voucher program even as he was sitting on evidence of its success. <edit> In New York City with its 1.1 million students, mayoral control has resulted in better test scores and graduation rates, while expanding charter schools, which means more and better education choices for low-income families. But mayoral control expires in June unless state lawmakers renew it, and the United Federation of Teachers is working with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to weaken or kill it. President Obama's stimulus is sending some $100 billion to the nation's school districts. What will he demand in return? The state budget passed by the New York legislature last week freezes funding for charters but increases it by more that $400 million for other public schools. Perhaps a visit to a charter school in Harlem would help Mr. Obama honor his reform pledge. \"I'm looking at the data here in front of me,\" Mr. Duncan told the New York Post. \"Graduation rates are up. Test scores are up. Teacher salaries are up. Social promotion was eliminated. Dramatically increasing parental choice. That's real progress.\" Mr. Duncan's help in New York is in stark contrast to his department's decision to sit on a performance review of the D.C. voucher program while Congress debated its future in March. The latest annual evaluation was finally released Friday, and it shows measurable academic gains. The Opportunity Scholarship Program provides $7,500 vouchers to 1,700 low-income families in D.C. to send their children to private schools. Ninety-nine percent of the children are black or Hispanic, and there are more than four applicants for each scholarship. The 2008 report demonstrated progress among certain subgroups of children but not everyone. This year's report shows statistically significant academic gains for the entire voucher-receiving population. Children attending private schools with the aid of the scholarships are reading nearly a half-grade ahead of their peers who did not receive vouchers. Voucher recipients are doing no better in math but they're doing no worse. Which means that no voucher participant is in worse academic shape than before, and many students are much better off. \"There are transition difficulties, a culture shock upon entering a school where you're expected to pay attention, learn, do homework,\" says Jay Greene, an education scholar at the Manhattan Institute. \"But these results fit a pattern that we've seen in other evaluations of vouchers. Benefits compound over time.\" It's bad enough that Democrats are killing a program that parents love and is closing the achievement gap between poor minorities and whites. But as scandalous is that the Education Department almost certainly knew the results of this evaluation for months. Voucher recipients were tested last spring. The scores were analyzed in the late summer and early fall, and in November preliminary results were presented to a team of advisers who work with the Education Department to produce the annual evaluation. Since Education officials are intimately involved in this process, they had to know what was in this evaluation even as Democrats passed (and Mr. Obama signed) language that ends the program after next year. Opponents of school choice for poor children have long claimed they'd support vouchers if there was evidence that they work. While running for President last year, Mr. Obama told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that if he saw more proof that they were successful, he would \"not allow my predisposition to stand in the way of making sure that our kids can learn . . . You do what works for the kids.\" Except, apparently, when what works is opposed by unions. Mr. Duncan's office spurned our repeated calls and emails asking what and when he and his aides knew about these results. We do know the Administration prohibited anyone involved with the evaluation from discussing it publicly. You'd think we were talking about nuclear secrets, not about a taxpayer-funded pilot program. A reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Duncan's department didn't want proof of voucher success to interfere with Senator Dick Durbin's campaign to kill vouchers at the behest of the teachers unions. The decision to let 1,700 poor kids get tossed from private schools is a moral disgrace. It also exposes the ugly politics that lies beneath union and liberal efforts across the country to undermine mayoral control, charter schools, vouchers or any reform that threatens their monopoly over public education dollars and jobs. The Sheldon Silver-Dick Durbin Democrats aren't worried that school choice doesn't work. They're worried that it does, and if Messrs. Obama and Duncan want to succeed as reformers they need to say so consistently.",

It is awful that some children have no choice other than to attend schools where they worry every minute, for their own safety. Why force these kids to continue going to these schools? People just assume that every private school is just going to take these vouchers. With vouchers come accountability and government intrusion into the private school system. The private Catholic school where I taught would not be so quick to take this option. The school has it's rules and requirements. If you didn't want to be there you could leave. The school didn't have to take everyone. If a student disrupted the school and the students, the parents would be asked to find another place to educate that student. We also had students of other faiths enrolled in our school, and it was not the school's purpose to indoctrinate them into its faith. (Actually I had more religious harassment at the public school I had left prior to teaching at the private school.) Also, think logistics....how will these new students get to a private school? Not every community has a local private school and how would the student get to school. I just can't see every private school investing in mass transportation nor every parent able to drive these children to school across a city. Would the vouchers cover the cost of the transportation, too? Will the vouchers cover the cost of uniforms? Class supplies? The parents at private school do not grumble about the fact that they have to provide their children with pencils, pens, notebooks, lab fees, etc. It is expected and generally stated in the enrollment application. Oh, and remember, not all who send their children to private or parochial schools are rich. Many families make great sacrifices to make this education available to their children; but it is a matter of choice. In another post, someone mentioned that private schools can educate children much cheaper. This may well be the case. In our private school, parents would volunteer to clean (didn't have to hire a janitorial service). Need an electrician.....oh so and so's dad will help out. We had parents and some students that worked over the summer to sand and varnish all old hardwood floors of the elementary building. The school raised money to pay for the supplies and equipment needed. They did a beautiful job. The students took ownership of their facility and due to this no graffiti or property damage. Of course, there were some students that would also get to clean the bathroom or hallway with a toothbrush. (Parental support) So after a few times, these students, too, began to care about the appearance of the school. Yes, and many teachers work for much less because the working conditions are often times more desirable than some public schools, as well as class size much smaller. Students are for the most part polite and are there to learn. Now that is not to say that ALL public schools are less desirable than a public school. Right now I teach in a very nice public school that is in a higher socio-economic area with a majority of college educated parents. Parents are involved in their child's education and have high expectations. Communication is done readily by email and grades are all on-line. Vouchers would not take away our student population. Maybe, the real problem, is with those schools that have no control, have huge student populations (in which students have to have security and metal detectors), and have no discipline/high expectations. Perhaps reducing school size would be a part of the answer. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",
