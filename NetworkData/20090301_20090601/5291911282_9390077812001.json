This is the \"TEAR DROP\" made and Installed by the Russians to honor those Who died in 9/11 and a statement against Terrorism. It is very impressive. The tear drop is lined up with the Statue Of Liberty ... ....it is an impressive memorial and Statement against terrorism. Names of the persons killed on 9 11 are inscribed on the base. The base like the Vietnam Memorial wall. It was a cold and Windy day but well worth the drive to see. It is down in the Shipping yards across from \"The Lady\". The walkway is made of stones.
