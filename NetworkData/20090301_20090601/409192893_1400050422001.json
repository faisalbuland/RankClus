Muller lasted less than 10 seconds. Olbermann said that he will contribute the money to Veterans of Valor, a charity founded by Sgt. Klay South, who administered the controversial interrogation technique. Previously, Olbermann has said he would make a donation of $1,000 for each second Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity lasted while being waterboarded if Hannity followed through on his offer last month to undergo the process for charity. But Olbermann said Friday he is withdrawing his offer to Hannity, whose syndicated radio show also airs on WLS-AM. \"With today's development, the point is moot,\" Olbermann said. \"Mancow Muller had the guts to put his mouth where his mouth was, and the guts to admit he was dead wrong -- as you saw, he not only said it is torture, but that he had nearly drowned as a boy, and it is drowning, and that he would have admitted to anything to make it stop.\"",

Ezra Klein at the Washington Post piled on. So did Jonathan Chait: \u201cI think the torture debate would be mighty different if more of the conservatives who scoff at waterboarding would try the same thing.\u201d And Think Progress.
