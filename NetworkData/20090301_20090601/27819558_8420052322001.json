        "content": "Gay Adoption Win in Florida The National Center for Lesbian Rights scored a decisive win for gay parents in Florida, when an appeals court unanimously agreed on Wednesday that the Sunshine State must honor second-parent adoptions by same-sex couples granted in other states. The Florida court of appeals reversed a lower court ruling and held that Florida must give full faith and credit to adoptions granted to same-sex couples by other states. About half of U.S. states allow second-parent adoptions by same-sex couples, according to Shannon Price Minter, legal director for NCLR.

Your constantly bending over pulling weeds out of your flower beds (Chiropractor's delight) and fighting the unrelenting mold that grows on the sides of your home and on your sidewalks & driveways (very slippery). The flying bugs and Fire Ants rule supreme and we have cock roaches that are the size of locust, we call them Palmetto bugs but they're just giant roaches. I have to go on Fire Ant Patrol around the yard every three days using expensive ant killer chemicals to keep them from overrunning the property and I still get bit because the sneaky little critters are hiding in the flower beds and bite me when I bend over and reach down to pull out the weeds that popped up overnight!! Back on topic; There are some angry seething folks down here that are as mad as a swarm of Africanized bees over this Appeal Court ruling. The plot thickens",
