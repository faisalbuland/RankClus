IMO the ONLY thing Limbaugh cares about is his big pay check and he knows that depends on continuing the attacks and lies his fans want to hear. I beleive that if Limbaugh thought he could make more money attacking the very Conservative issues and people he has supported for years and supporting the issues and people he has attacked he would do it in a NY minute.",
