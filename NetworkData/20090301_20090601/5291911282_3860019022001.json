Weir 260th QM Batallion out of Fort Lee, VA. I am fighting a Veterans Administration Service connected disability case. I didn't realize when I got out of active duty that my DD-214 did not show my service in Somalia. I do have awards proving it but the V.A. says that's not good enough. Any help is welcome. Please help!!!",

Please help!!! Did you keep any of your copies of orders for military movement to and from that area? That might help. Probably a redundant question, but I have copies of every set of orders I was ever issued - just in case - - Wandering and Wondering",

I am now trying to get my DFAS for 1993 which will show my danger duty pay and Oconus pay. I am also going to the social security office to get print outs which will show that I payed no federal taxes for that time period. If you can think of any other ideas to put me in the right directions please emaail me back either here or at solider4u2007@yahoo.com",
