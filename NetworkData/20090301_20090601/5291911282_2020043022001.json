They can hire away some of the best by virtue of astronomical pay, but they also can draw some of the worst who can't continue to make it in their units. Any government that has made long term use of mercenaries has always ran into one problem- after a while, they begin to think of themselves as a power unto themselves. Look back at Mad Mike Hoare- if he hadn't gotten caught early, the Seychelles would have been overthrown to make basically a mercenary homeland. We now have a situation where a private company has more armed troops, armed/armored vehicles, and armed aircraft than some small nations. Their plan to put armed vessels to sea may still cause problems- combat vessels at sea, not part of a nations forces, are classified as pirates, the same as those they are supposedly planning to oppose. Does anyone find it strange that whenever the State Dept would start talking about cut backs to PSCs, an incident would occur, usually involving PSC personnel engaging civilians, causing greater unrest and greater need for PSCs?",

        "reply": "The situation with \"Private Security Contractors\" is like a double edged knife-they give the government hiring them some deniability, but they also aren't directly controlled by that gov't and can get out of control. They can hire away some of the best by virtue of astronomical pay, but they also can draw some of the worst who can't continue to make it in their units. Any government that has made long term use of mercenaries has always ran into one problem- after a while, they begin to think of themselves as a power unto themselves. Look back at Mad Mike Hoare- if he hadn't gotten caught early, the Seychelles would have been overthrown to make basically a mercenary homeland. We now have a situation where a private company has more armed troops, armed/armored vehicles, and armed aircraft than some small nations. Their plan to put armed vessels to sea may still cause problems- combat vessels at sea, not part of a nations forces, are classified as pirates, the same as those they are supposedly planning to oppose. Does anyone find it strange that whenever the State Dept would start talking about cut backs to PSCs, an incident would occur, usually involving PSC personnel engaging civilians, causing greater unrest and greater need for PSCs?",
