The fear prevented me from developing friendships. I was never a part of the group as a result. I know that changing DADT, so that gays and lesbians can serve openly will help many of us serve better. There are more active duty members that are accepting of us, than those who do not. The current policies enable that disapproving minority to terrorize us. I, for one, will celebrate the day that we are equal in the service. Oh, and before anyone uses the \"watching me in the shower\" line; I've showered with hundreds of guys over the years and was seldom impressed, so get over yourselves.",
