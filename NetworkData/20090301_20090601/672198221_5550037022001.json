A territory existing as an independent state. Texas CANNOT be \"sovereign\" with out succession. Not even before the Civil War were States considered \"Soverign.\" In fact the opposite it true, as States were denied many of the characteristics of a soverign power. Now we have the 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution which should have put this entire conversation to rest. \"States Rights,\" in the context of America is not a discussion of the rights of a Soverign Nation.

Now we have the 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution which should have put this entire conversation to rest. \"States Rights,\" in the context of America is not a discussion of the rights of a Soverign Nation.
