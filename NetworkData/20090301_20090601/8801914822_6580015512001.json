I don't want to sound condescending or that I only like the underdog. In fact, there is much about the Chinese people that I truly admire, and I would be proud to face them on the field of honor. But I also know that there is a certain racial arrogance that has defined China for 3,000 years, and that is what our broken and betrayed Western Civilization will be up against in an all-out war. As for Nixon - Well I think the last honest president we had was JFK, even with all his faults. Mr Thrust , to your surprise , you observation on CHinese and chinese civilisations is not particularly correct . You dont like conquer you love weaker vessel . That is fine with me , but there is something to be said about this chirisianty . Chinese people does need absorb more western culture , but our people has to be selective . I tell you a story , there is a monk live in seetle , he teachs tibet buddism . And he want to print his teachings . the publisher rejcted him , the only reason is that , his stuff belongs to devil . ALright , if we brought Chrisitaniy back into china and let it spread in a grand scale , all what our people had cherished for many generations now become something devilish and unacceptable . SO , I believe what we need is more torelant western culture . like western esotercism , western occultism , western mystical culture . Have you heard about Kabblar tree , the tree of life , Madona is a fervent follower , rosicursiant order , gnotism . western hermitism . And plus we import the Yoga religion of india . there way we will have a wonderful melting pot in CHina . Chirisitanity is dictatorship , I dont think our people will embrace them wholeheartly , what we need is stuff there will harmonisly co-exist with our culture .SOmething like western esotercism and india esotericism . Thats what I believe .",
