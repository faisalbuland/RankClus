You, like my 20-year-old, drama-major son, \"get it;\" \"it,\" being the meaning of military service and sacrifice. And while our generations can be light-years away from each other in many ways, you both \"get it\" because of the example of your veteran fathers. I'm sure you're glad your father is still around, not only because of what he can share with you, but also what you able to share with him now that you are grown. I lost my Air Force veteran father when I was 23 years old. He never saw me in uniform, and he never met his grandson. I've always regretted that we didn't talk more -- of course, neither of us knew at the time that he would be gone and at St Michael's side at 56 years old. There is a song by Mike and the Mechanics, \"In the Living Years,\" that says it all: \"I wasn't there that morning when my father passed away. I didn't get to tell him all the things I had to say. \"I thought I caught his spirit, later that same year. I'm sure I heard his echo in my baby's newborn tears. I just wish I could have told him in The Living Years.\" I couldn't have said it better myself.",
