Nancy Pelosi, by virtue of her position of being 3rd in line for the Presidency, being briefed regularily on top secret issues, and having access to top secret documents, does not mean she is compelled to anywer with truth and candor, each and every crazy question served up by the Washington press corps. In fact, she has every right to be evasive or to not even be truthful when posed such questions, for to do so would undermine national security and secret missions and/or personnel. I mean, who do you think she is, the office of the former Vice President, who \"out\" active CIA agents for political gain? This lady is doing her job and a damn good job at that.", 
        "reply": " I possibly would agree with you if she had answered the questions as such,\"Because of the nature of the briefing, I can not and will not comment on that question.\" Instead, she outright DENIED it which is just as much as a violation of the secret briefing if she had admitted it. You have no grounds to defend her Jack, give it up. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns.

So if they are going to have a truth commission ALL parties involved had best have an answer. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns.

Doesn't bother me that she sounded evasive or even that she lied for she did so to protect national security, as a person 3rd in line for the presidency should. In fact, sounds to me she's done her job well and has not outed any secret programs the United States is engaged in. If the Republicans want to make an issue of it, let them. It's them who will be losing the elections because they out secret programs and personnel for their own political gain, and constantly try and deflect important issues with nonsense issues like this because they have nothing ( and I do mean \"nothing\") else going for them. Nancy is doing her job just fine. I know how hard it must be for Republican's to have a shrewd and intelligent woman in her high position of 3rd in line, but that's the way it is, get used to it.
