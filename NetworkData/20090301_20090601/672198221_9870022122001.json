I wonder what was going through this young Marines mind when he decided to do this? I also wonder why he is only being held on a $50,000 bail bond? U.S. Marine arrested at Logan Airport for weapons possession Mia Carter Boston (WBZ Newsroom) -- Massachusetts State Police have arrested a U.S. Marine at Boston's Logan Airport, after he was allegedly found with weapons and explosives in his luggage. Police say it was approximately 7:10 a.m. Sunday, April 19, when an explosive detection luggage screening machine was activated by a piece of luggage, said to belong to 22-year-old Justin Reed, a U.S. Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, in Jacksonville, North Carolina. It's being reported that Reed had arrived at Logan Airport from Las Vegas aboard a red-eye flight; he was reportedly scheduled to board an 8:00 a.m. flight to Charlotte, North Carolina. He apparently had to re-check his luggage during the layover. Reed was tracked down by authorities and taken into custody without incident. He faces charges that include unlawful possession of an infernal machine and unlawful possession of a concealed weapon in a secure area of an airport Reed was ordered held on $50,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in East Boston District Court Tuesday.",

I wonder what was going through this young Marines mind when he decided to do this? I also wonder why he is only being held on a $50,000 bail bond? U.S. Marine arrested at Logan Airport for weapons possession Mia Carter Boston (WBZ Newsroom) -- Massachusetts State Police have arrested a U.S. Marine at Boston's Logan Airport, after he was allegedly found with weapons and explosives in his luggage. Police say it was approximately 7:10 a.m. Sunday, April 19, when an explosive detection luggage screening machine was activated by a piece of luggage, said to belong to 22-year-old Justin Reed, a U.S. Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, in Jacksonville, North Carolina. It's being reported that Reed had arrived at Logan Airport from Las Vegas aboard a red-eye flight; he was reportedly scheduled to board an 8:00 a.m. flight to Charlotte, North Carolina. He apparently had to re-check his luggage during the layover. Reed was tracked down by authorities and taken into custody without incident. He faces charges that include unlawful possession of an infernal machine and unlawful possession of a concealed weapon in a secure area of an airport Reed was ordered held on $50,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in East Boston District Court Tuesday.",
