Four decades later, this country and six others \u2014 Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, South Africa and Sweden \u2014 grant marriage rights to same-sex couples on an equal footing with heterosexuals. Many other countries, as well as most American states, have laws restricting access to same-sex marriage. Here are some key dates in the story: Before the Criminal Law Amendment Act was passed in 1969, homosexuality was a criminal offence in Canada, as it remains to this day in many other countries. Four decades later, this country and six others \u2014 Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, South Africa and Sweden \u2014 grant marriage rights to same-sex couples on an equal footing with heterosexuals. Many other countries, as well as most American states, have laws restricting access to same-sex marriage. Here are some key dates in the story: May 26, 2009: The U.S. In a 6-1 decision, the California Supreme Court upholds the state's same-sex marriage ban. But it also rules that the roughly 18,000 existing same-sex marriages carried out in the state before the ban can stand. Supporters of same-sex marriage vow to press on, hoping to put another proposition over the issue on the 2010 state ballot and eyeing another legal challenge before the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. May 18, 2009: The U.S. Washington state Gov. Chris Gregoire signs into law a bill that extends all the domestic rights and benefits of heterosexual marriages to same-sex couples. The \"everything but marriage\" law will take effect in July 26, unless opponents can gather enough signatures to force a referendum on the question. May 13, 2009: The U.S. The New York State Assembly passes a same-sex marriage bill, bringing New York one step closer to legalizing such marriages.

May 9, 2009: Hungary Hungary's official government publication announces that gay couples will be able to register domestic partnerships beginning July 1, provided both partners are at least 18 years old.

The passing of Proposition 8 leaves Connecticut and Massachusetts as the only two states to allow gay marriage. Amendments to ban gay marriage are also approved in Arizona and Florida.
