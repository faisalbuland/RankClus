Is he a kid just messing around? Then you find out info on the dad and you hunt there and get more info. You all are like a machine. I have to tell you, you make me more alert and thought provoking on issues that I am faced with. I really like your style guys. It is something else to watch the way you go about collecting your info and putting all the peices in to place. At the end of your hunt, I always know you will have the answers and we will be better protected if need be or even make a new friend if so lucky. Thanks for letting me be the fly on the wall so I can watch and learn.",
