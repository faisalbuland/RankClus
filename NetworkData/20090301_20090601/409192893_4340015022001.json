The standing authority gave them clearence to engage the pirates if the life of the captain was in immediate danger. The on scene commander deemed this to be true and gave the order to fire......... This was not a rescue attempt ordered by National Command Authority i.e. the President. It was a reaction by the on scene commander under standard authority to safeguard the life of a hostage. The AP is reporting that President Obama gave the order to use military force to rescue the hostage, this is misleading.... The AP is making it sound that there was an active rescue ordered by the President. It was not, there was an imminent threat and the local commander gave the order to fire. Good on Obama for ensuring their authorization was clear, but let's also be clear that he did not authorize or order an active rescue attempt. uhler...

The AP is making it sound that there was an active rescue ordered by the President. It was not, there was an imminent threat and the local commander gave the order to fire.

Look umm, I hate to pollute this thread further, but as one who has been authorized to use \"appropriate force\", I can pretty much tell you it's a legal cop out, as appropriate force is always determined later.

This was not a rescue attempt ordered by National Command Authority i.e. the President. It was a reaction by the on scene commander under standard authority to safeguard the life of a hostage. The AP is reporting that President Obama gave the order to use military force to rescue the hostage, this is misleading.... The AP is making it sound that there was an active rescue ordered by the President. It was not, there was an imminent threat and the local commander gave the order to fire.

THANK YOU PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!! Agreed. President Obama did not hesitate to give our Naval Forces the authority to rescue the captain using any and all appropriate measures. The Commander In Chief doing his thing... Look umm, I hate to pollute this thread further, but as one who has been authorized to use \"appropriate force\", I can pretty much tell you it's a legal cop out, as appropriate force is always determined later. Had the Captain been killed in the exchange, you surely would have heard, \"I authorized the use of appropriate force and clearly this wasn't.\" The Captain of the Bainbridge made the call, \"Kill them now.\" Where he was \"at\" and Where Obama was \"at\" are two entirely different places. Authorizing appropriate force is not definitely authorizing the use of deadly force, and the thing that burns me, is that this is being reported as a negotiation gone wrong, with the Navy pulling the fish out of the fire. This was not a planned rescue attempt, as I believe it should have been...three days ago. If someone had authorized deadly force. And he sums it up with the line, \"We need the world's help dealing with these pirates.\" Certainly the world needs to be involved in anti-piracy ops. They have been. It is a combined fleet that patrols those waters. But it seems to me like the world once again needed our help to show them how to deal with their issues. The frikin' cowboy way. God bless the Captain of Bainbridge and those snipers. It isn't like they had the MSM spin machine in their pocket to clarify any \"misperception of mistakes\" when they made their momentous decision to shoot. It is an awesome American Navy day. Let's let it be that.",

Must suck to be you right now and see the CinC not fail. He failed to act. He covered his ass with legalese, sent an FBI hostage negotiator...and sat there for four days. Commander Castellano seized the initiative and acted on a situation he had to wait for. I haven't been around here since 2000. Tell me. How many posts praising George Bush for acting were there the day Jessica Lynch was rescued?",
