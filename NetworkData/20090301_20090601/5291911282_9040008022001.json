Is what the problem is in your home country. What ever happened to \"my house, my rules\"? I have read about such groups in the US, yes. In my home country (Ireland, not the UK), there are comparatively few Muslims, but quite a few Sikhs. They retain their traditions and culture, but contribute positively to communal life. The same is true of Sikhs in the UK; they're an asset to the place and not a tiresome burden - in contrast to some groups of Muslims. Again, when you mention \"these groups\" you seem to want to pitch in the Sikhs with the Muslims, just because they wear turbans. There is a significant difference, not the least being that Sikhs, more than any other group, effectively destroyed the Muslim attempt to take over the whole of India. As for assimilating Sikhs with their culture into the US Armed Forces: why not? It appears to be the typical argument based on: \"We've always done it like that\". Maybe it's time to examine the rules again and see if certain aspects can't be adapted.

        "reply": " I have read about such groups in the US, yes. In my home country (Ireland, not the UK), there are comparatively few Muslims, but quite a few Sikhs. They retain their traditions and culture, but contribute positively to communal life. The same is true of Sikhs in the UK; they're an asset to the place and not a tiresome burden - in contrast to some groups of Muslims. Again, when you mention \"these groups\" you seem to want to pitch in the Sikhs with the Muslims, just because they wear turbans. There is a significant difference, not the least being that Sikhs, more than any other group, effectively destroyed the Muslim attempt to take over the whole of India. As for assimilating Sikhs with their culture into the US Armed Forces: why not? It appears to be the typical argument based on: \"We've always done it like that\". Maybe it's time to examine the rules again and see if certain aspects can't be adapted.

They might serve just fine in the British Army with their turban/barnet (head cover) and facial hair, but the US Military doesn't single out this group with the rules to keep them out, they are rules that have been there longer than most of those fighting against them have been alive.

In my home country (Ireland, not the UK), there are comparatively few Muslims, but quite a few Sikhs. They retain their traditions and culture, but contribute positively to communal life. The same is true of Sikhs in the UK; they're an asset to the place and not a tiresome burden - in contrast to some groups of Muslims.

Don't forget that something like 170,000 Sikhs died in WWII. They were all volunteers! I don't quite understand this automatic knee-jerk reaction to change and adaptation.

You might want to take a butcher's here: \u201chttp://sikhsinkuwait.wordpress.com/2007/08/18/sikh-recruitment-drive-for-british-army/\u201d Where it says this: quote: The Afghan Sikh community is of great help to the British Special Air Service Regiment and USA Delta force for intelligence and reconnoitering. They serve in an informal capacity with these armies. And this: quote: The British army has many different forms of correct uniforms. Most regiments have distinct styles of uniforms as well as distinct traditions. It is easy for the British army to fit Sikhs in with this mindset. The British Army is to be commended for this step. Many Sikhs would be happy to continue our five hundred year tradition of fighting fundamentalist terrorism. The ideology of the fundamentalist terrorists such as Al Queda goes back to Islamic sects that held sway over India and resulted in the death of millions as well as the destruction of nearly all North Indian Holy places Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jain. The Sikh Gurus and their disiciples fought and neutralized this fundamentalist movement. Obviously, I have a bit of a different mindset and point of view to you, since I served with Sikhs (and also Buddhists, Hindus and about twenty other religions) in the British Army. But it can\u2019t do any harm to gather some information on a subject before you start gobbing off, can it? MsG",

        "reply": " You're still displaying your ignorance, fella. You might want to take a butcher's here: \u201chttp://sikhsinkuwait.wordpress.com/2007/08/18/sikh-recruitment-drive-for-british-army/\u201d Where it says this: quote: The Afghan Sikh community is of great help to the British Special Air Service Regiment and USA Delta force for intelligence and reconnoitering. They serve in an informal capacity with these armies. And this: quote: The British army has many different forms of correct uniforms. Most regiments have distinct styles of uniforms as well as distinct traditions. It is easy for the British army to fit Sikhs in with this mindset. The British Army is to be commended for this step. Many Sikhs would be happy to continue our five hundred year tradition of fighting fundamentalist terrorism. The ideology of the fundamentalist terrorists such as Al Queda goes back to Islamic sects that held sway over India and resulted in the death of millions as well as the destruction of nearly all North Indian Holy places Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jain. The Sikh Gurus and their disiciples fought and neutralized this fundamentalist movement. Obviously, I have a bit of a different mindset and point of view to you, since I served with Sikhs (and also Buddhists, Hindus and about twenty other religions) in the British Army. But it can\u2019t do any harm to gather some information on a subject before you start gobbing off, can it? MsG",

Is what the problem is in your home country. What ever happened to \"my house, my rules\"? I have read about such groups in the US, yes. In my home country (Ireland, not the UK), there are comparatively few Muslims, but quite a few Sikhs. They retain their traditions and culture, but contribute positively to communal life. The same is true of Sikhs in the UK; they're an asset to the place and not a tiresome burden - in contrast to some groups of Muslims. Again, when you mention \"these groups\" you seem to want to pitch in the Sikhs with the Muslims, just because they wear turbans. There is a significant difference, not the least being that Sikhs, more than any other group, effectively destroyed the Muslim attempt to take over the whole of India. As for assimilating Sikhs with their culture into the US Armed Forces: why not? It appears to be the typical argument based on: \"We've always done it like that\". Maybe it's time to examine the rules again and see if certain aspects can't be adapted. I mean, it's not as if a few fellas with beards and wearing turbans (and Sikhs are a warrior caste, don't forget, and thus make excellent soldiers) are going to destabilise the whole organisation, is it? Don't forget that something like 170,000 Sikhs died in WWII. They were all volunteers! I don't quite understand this automatic knee-jerk reaction to change and adaptation. It's not what has kept the human race from improving things over the centuries. Just a thought. MsG",

They serve in an informal capacity with these armies. And this: quote: The British army has many different forms of correct uniforms. Most regiments have distinct styles of uniforms as well as distinct traditions. It is easy for the British army to fit Sikhs in with this mindset. The British Army is to be commended for this step. Many Sikhs would be happy to continue our five hundred year tradition of fighting fundamentalist terrorism. The ideology of the fundamentalist terrorists such as Al Queda goes back to Islamic sects that held sway over India and resulted in the death of millions as well as the destruction of nearly all North Indian Holy places Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jain. The Sikh Gurus and their disiciples fought and neutralized this fundamentalist movement. Obviously, I have a bit of a different mindset and point of view to you, since I served with Sikhs (and also Buddhists, Hindus and about twenty other religions) in the British Army. But it can\u2019t do any harm to gather some information on a subject before you start gobbing off, can it? MsG",

Is what the problem is in your home country. What ever happened to \"my house, my rules\"? I have read about such groups in the US, yes. In my home country (Ireland, not the UK), there are comparatively few Muslims, but quite a few Sikhs. They retain their traditions and culture, but contribute positively to communal life. The same is true of Sikhs in the UK; they're an asset to the place and not a tiresome burden - in contrast to some groups of Muslims. Again, when you mention \"these groups\" you seem to want to pitch in the Sikhs with the Muslims, just because they wear turbans. There is a significant difference, not the least being that Sikhs, more than any other group, effectively destroyed the Muslim attempt to take over the whole of India. As for assimilating Sikhs with their culture into the US Armed Forces: why not? It appears to be the typical argument based on: \"We've always done it like that\". Maybe it's time to examine the rules again and see if certain aspects can't be adapted. I mean, it's not as if a few fellas with beards and wearing turbans (and Sikhs are a warrior caste, don't forget, and thus make excellent soldiers) are going to destabilise the whole organisation, is it? Don't forget that something like 170,000 Sikhs died in WWII. They were all volunteers! I don't quite understand this automatic knee-jerk reaction to change and adaptation. It's not what has kept the human race from improving things over the centuries. Just a thought. MsG",
