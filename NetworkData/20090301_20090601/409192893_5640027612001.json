It really makes no sense other than the legislature was attempting to put the Governor back into \"her place\" and show her who had the real power in Kansas government. You just hit the nail on the head, actually. It was a power-play. A gang of unpopular local representatives, trying to push the governor around at the expense of working folks. Basically, they wanted to do anything they could to make it harder for the governor, to make her look bad, and to make people think it's her fault. Of course, most of us know better. They also wanted to back her into a corner to get her to agree to some of their political demands, almost like political black-mail, using state employees as a bargaining chip. Cheap tactic, I'd say. quote: Real wierd... I have asked my family there and they do not know either. All the people who work with me were discussing it in-depth.

Where I work, I know we're all doing everything we can to trim the budget without firing anyone. We're trying to formulate a budget that's even tighter than the one we've been told to anticipate, and the intent is to avoid both layoffs and furloughs. We'd go to furloughs before we'd go to layoffs. Our institution and the state both know that if even more people are out of work, things will go downhill even faster (fewer dollars to spend, even more businesses laying off people, less tax money... downward spiral), so we're doing everything we can to keep everyone on board. We'll fix equipment instead of getting new stuff. We'll recycle more. We'll consolidate supplies and projects whenever possible. We're taking care of ourselves, and our governor is taking care of her end of the bargain. I hope she doesn't take the nomination. Kansas needs her more.",
