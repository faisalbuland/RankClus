Perhaps the RNC should start interviewing again now for a new chairman ... one who has \"better judgment\" in deferring the Republican political platform to a fat-mouthed radio entertainer who has hypocritically never lifted one finger in actual civic contribution in his life or conducted his personal life to the moral aspirations of the Republican base. It certainly seems that Mr. Steele has already compromised his political integrity and ability to forge a Republican agenda that really does respond to mainstream American sentiment.
