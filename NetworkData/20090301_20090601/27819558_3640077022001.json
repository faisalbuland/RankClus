Current state law exempts spouses, children, parents, grandparents, stepchildren or stepparents, and siblings from paying state inheritance tax when property changes hands. All others pay a 10% tax on the property's value. The measure, which passed the senate by a vote of 27-18, adds domestic partners to the list. The bill is awaiting the signature of Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who intends to sign it. >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid78951.asp Since Maryland doesn't allow civil unions or any other recognition of gay marriages how do you prove you are someone's domestic partner?",

Nowhere in the Constitution does it mandate that we subsidize any group. I think that all those str8 married couples should have to give up their subsidy...AND it should be retroactive. Tax them for all of that property that was willed to them. The revenue from just the last 50 years should be enough to dig us out of this fiscal mess. You DID say NO group is subsidized, right?",
