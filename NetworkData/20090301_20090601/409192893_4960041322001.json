The children that depend on our schools and libraries will one day be the US citizens who run our societies and choose our leaders. We watch our students struggle when resources are lacking, teacher's salaries are not competitive, and facilities do not have the funds to stay open after school. The current economic recession is bound to have repercussions years from now when underprepared students enter the working world. With this in mind, we are deeply troubled that the U.S. Army is planning to spend untold millions opening combat video game arcades throughout the country. This is where our tax dollars are being spent while public schools and libraries suffer from the economic downturn. Already the Army Experience Center in Northeast Philadelphia, the first of these arcades, attracts hundreds of high schoolers while Philadelphia library hours are cut due to city budget deficits. Instead of learning and experiencing history and culture these children will be inundated by military propaganda as they are prepared for current and future wars. As people who have dedicated our lives to teaching our youth that knowledge and access to information are the primary means to a peaceful society we condemn this militarization that undoes our efforts to provide for the future. We call for the closing of the Army Experience Center in the Franklin Mills Mall in Northeast Philadelphia. We boycott the businesses at the Franklin Mills Mall until the mall authorities expel the US Army from its property. We demand that the United States Army cancel the Army Experience project and cease from building video arcades in the communities where our youth live. We call for our tax dollars to be allocated for the education of all young people before any money goes toward military recruitment. Sign the petition at **http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/educatorsagainstarmyexpe rience/** This petition will be sent to the AEC staff, the recruitment division of the US Army, local politicians and local press. Please identify the school or institution you work for on the petition. This will give readers a sense of the breadth of support.

Therefore if the good people of Philly are upset that there are Army video arcades being set up in the mall while their library cuts hours, it seems they could all chip in pay more CITY TAXES and the library would stay open. Or you can take it for what it is a bunch of hypocritical liberals (as if there was ANY OTHER TYPE) complaining about the Army every chance they get. Oh my they'll feign \"something must be done to stop these precious children from playing violent ARMY VIDEO GAMES, junior turn down the volume on GRAND THEFT AUTO, 6 DAYS IN FALLUJAH, ETC so I can sign this petition\". Yet these are the same people who cry at the top of their lungs \"where is our National Guard\" when they experience flooding, blizzards, power outtages etc. Well maybe if you would let YOUR CHILDREN JOIN you just might have that all important \"HELP\" arrive when you need it.",
