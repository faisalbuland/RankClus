There are even early fragile signs that the recession MAY be receding. Obama has managed to inject some hope in what might have been a desparate situation. I don't think anyone likes the idea of borrowing $800 billion from the future, and not all of the stimulus money will be wisely spent, but we have so far avoided disaster and the alternatives to Obama's plan (and the TARP bailouts) might have been far worse. Bottom line is that it is MUCH too soon to pronounce the stimulus a success or failure, but at least there are fragile signs of hope which weren't there three months ago.",

        "reply": " Pronouncing the stimulus package a failure at this early date is like those people who were prouncing the Iraq surge a failure just a month or two after it started when most new troops had not even arrived. It is MUCH too early to say whether the stimulus will succeed or fail. What is clear is that in September 2008, the economy faced a potential catastrophe. The actions taken since that time, while disagreeable (except to the executives of bailout companies who got large bonuses) have so far managed to stave off what could have been a financial meltdown. There are even early fragile signs that the recession MAY be receding. Obama has managed to inject some hope in what might have been a desparate situation. I don't think anyone likes the idea of borrowing $800 billion from the future, and not all of the stimulus money will be wisely spent, but we have so far avoided disaster and the alternatives to Obama's plan (and the TARP bailouts) might have been far worse. Bottom line is that it is MUCH too soon to pronounce the stimulus a success or failure, but at least there are fragile signs of hope which weren't there three months ago.",
