The memorial there was built with private funds and was dedicated sometime in the early '90s, I believe. Sen. Robert Dole attended, as he was one of the primary backers of the memorial. The one in NOLA was originally where the duck boats, used in the landings, were built. To my knowledge, that is not a public memorial/museum, either. The WWII Memorial, on the Mall in Washington DC, is the official publicly-owned memorial to WWII - not just D-Day.",

It is not; the location was given to the WIMSA foundation since that space was deteriorating and WIMSA promised to refurbish it - which it did.",
