(AP) \u2014 Adrenaline and two hours of sleep got Mike Wieser through the night. But as he gasped for air and looked wearily at his country home slowly being absorbed by a lake of flood water, the new father looked like he would soon be running on empty. Water was seeping through his homemade dike, he was counting on three pumps to continue spitting out more water than was coming in, and the only other man there to keep it all afloat on Wednesday was his father-in-law. \"It's closing in,\" he said. Others are in the same boat. While Fargo and Bismarck get most of the attention as floodwaters approach, people in the countryside are quietly, and wearily, fighting a flood that has already arrived. \"They don't believe Fargo is going to give them any help,\" 20-year rural mail carrier Rhonda Wyum said about rural residents while snow swirled around her SUV on an icy intersection about 15 miles south of Fargo. She was unable to deliver mail to some residents because of flooded roads and said conditions were worse than in 1997, when a historic flood ravaged the area. \"If you listen to the news, it's all Fargo. A lot of these little townships around here are struggling, and people don't know it.\" Cass County Sheriff Paul D. Laney said 46 people had been rescued or evacuated from 15 homes in Oxbow and a six-mile corridor to the north. Laney expected more evacuations Thursday. Reaction to the rural-urban dichotomy from country folks illuminates the lifestyle of self-reliance in this sparse, harsh swath of the northern Plains. In interviews with residents, no one complained. Even as they fought off flood waters and at the same time a snowstorm raged. Wyum said most rural residents don't begrudge the attention Fargo is getting, understanding that the city \"has the fight of its life on its hands.\" The mood out here is oddly calm. As 72-year-old Don Tessier stood alone near the country home where he has lived for 51 years, he shrugged off suggestions his house was in danger. The tidy structure was nearly encircled by water, standing atop a mound Tessier built upon after a flood 40 years ago.\" Also: news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090326/ap_on_re_us/midwest_flooding \"Volunteers scramble as Fargo nears record flooding.\" \"By NATE JENKINS and DAVE KOLPACK, Associated Press Writers Nate Jenkins And Dave Kolpack, Associated Press Writers FARGO, N.D. \u2013 North Dakota's largest city moved to the brink of potentially disastrous flooding Thursday, with earlier optimism fading as officials predicted the Red River would reach a record-high crest of 41 feet by the weekend. Thousands of volunteers who have been piling sandbags for days scrambled to add another foot to Fargo's dike protection, and official briefings lost the jokes and quips that had broken the tension earlier in the week. Instead, Thursday's meeting opened with a prayer. \"We need all the help we can get,\" Mayor Dennis Walaker said. The city of 92,000 unveiled a contingency evacuation plan Thursday afternoon, but at least four nursing homes already had begun moving residents by then.\" This message has been edited.
