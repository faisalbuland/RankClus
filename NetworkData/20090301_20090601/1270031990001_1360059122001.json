Altogether, Americans are switching in and out of churches at unprecedented rates, with about half of Americans today saying that they have changed their religious affiliation at some point during their lives, according to a study released yesterday by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life... Among the most striking findings is that most people who change religious affiliation leave the denomination in which they were raised by age 24, and many change religious affiliation more than once. The study also explores the growing ranks of the unaffiliated, about 16 percent of American adults, according to Pew. The study finds many of the unaffiliated cite objections to religious people or religious institutions as the reason for leaving organized religion, rather than a conclusion that God does not exist. About one third of the unaffiliated say they are open to finding the right religion... Only 2 percent of former Catholics who are now unaffiliated volunteered the abuse scandal as the main reason they are no longer Catholic. Former Catholics who are now unaffiliated often said they left because of disagreements with the Catholic Church over homosexuality, abortion, birth control, or gender... Susan Spilecki, a 41-year-old English teacher from Brighton who was a lifelong and active Catholic until entering the Episcopal church last year, said she \"found plenty of company when I left.

I always knew I wasn't alone. I agree - I think this is a good thing. I think it's good that people are making decisions for themselves about what they believe, why they believe it, and which leaders they are willing to follow. The days when children automatically grew up to follow their parents' religious footsteps - just as their parents had followed their grandparents - are over. People are aware of different philosophies. People are aware of the misbehavior of the leaders of various churches and religions, and have chosen to explore their spirituality and their understanding of the Divine without the blind adherence to the dogma and decrees of any given church. Whether a person grows up to follow their parents' religion by their own choice, or switches to a similar denomination, or decides to follow a completely different path; whether that person joins a megachurch or simply decides to pray on their own... I think it's always a wonderful thing when people follow their conscience when it comes to religion, as opposed to blindly following the dogma they've been fed since birth.",

Among the most striking findings is that most people who change religious affiliation leave the denomination in which they were raised by age 24, and many change religious affiliation more than once.

About one third of the unaffiliated say they are open to finding the right religion... Only 2 percent of former Catholics who are now unaffiliated volunteered the abuse scandal as the main reason they are no longer Catholic. Former Catholics who are now unaffiliated often said they left because of disagreements with the Catholic Church over homosexuality, abortion, birth control, or gender...

I think it's good that people are making decisions for themselves about what they believe, why they believe it, and which leaders they are willing to follow. The days when children automatically grew up to follow their parents' religious footsteps - just as their parents had followed their grandparents - are over. People are aware of different philosophies. People are aware of the misbehavior of the leaders of various churches and religions, and have chosen to explore their spirituality and their understanding of the Divine without the blind adherence to the dogma and decrees of any given church. Whether a person grows up to follow their parents' religion by their own choice, or switches to a similar denomination, or decides to follow a completely different path; whether that person joins a megachurch or simply decides to pray on their own...
