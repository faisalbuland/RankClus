The Rockefellas,the Warbergs, the Rothchilds, the JP morgans, etc. Bankers who have controlled the disasters and then bought up everything in sight at pennies on the dollar further enrichening themselves and gaining more power. Since 1913 they have as a private group controlled our treasury printing worthless paper and loaning it to the gov for interest. A win win situation for them that creates a law of diminishing returns for us a government that can never repay the debt and so must loan from them more worthless paper which they gladly print. When one considers being born ino extreme wealth with the ability to buy anything that money can buy and never run out, Whats left to do with your life when money is no longer a factor? The obvious answer is Power and control and that is dangerous. Where does it end and at what point would they stop. Money is Power and Power corrupts while absolute power absoulutely corrupts. Our country is governed by the wealthy who dont have a clue to what it feels like to be in the shoes of the average American worker stuggling to fulfill the American dream and yet are expected to solve the problems.",

Hopefully we have a leader now that will prove himself by results and Gain the confidence by turning this mess around. I didnt vote for him but I do like what I see so far. Hes gaining the confidence and the market and housing are good indicators, His first appearance on the international scene was an outstanding sucess and the loans dont bother me at this point because it takes money to conduct business and I view it as a necessary investment.
