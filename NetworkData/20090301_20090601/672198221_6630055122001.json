I live in Southern New Hampshire close to what was Pease AFB, now a public airport with an ANG refueling wing still there. I've been seeing KC-135's for most of my life and have also seen a number of the KC-10's. The other day, I saw what looked like a KC-135 flying right over me at a low altitude. The thing is, it only had one engine on each wing instead of the two on each. As it passed over, I couldn't make out if it had a tail engine but it didn't look like it. Still, I thought it looked like the KC-135 as it didn't appear to be large enough to be a KC-10. Any ideas as to what the heck I was seeing? Don",
