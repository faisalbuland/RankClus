Don't drink the blood!\" Post a link to any previous American Leader describing waterboarding as \"enhanced interogation,\" and I'll change my mind. You have it azz backwards, and a certain amount of hypocricy is in your post. In fact, you can't even find the words, \"enhanced interogation\" before 9/11. So, just who invented this wonderful new expression? Right, Obama, those who have BDS, we're the ones who invented it... And what kills me here is that 3/4's of those who use the term aren't shy about saying, \"we want some blood, pull their toe nails out, skin them alive.\" Dave Dave, If it were your responsibility to stop any kind of organization from killing me, my family, my friends and neighbors, I hope you would only have to ask them for the info you need. However, since it probably would take more than asking, I hope you would, with careful conscience, find a way. I hope that you would go further, and enhance current methods within reason. Personnally, I would do pretty much what is necessary if it were reversed. I would likely want to know how far I could go without breaking the law, and would ask for advice from legal concil if possible. Rest assured. If breaking the law was the only way to save lives, I would do it as a last resort and be prepared to face the consequences. And Dave, other than these posts, I don't know you all that well but would still stick my neck out. What a man does to protect his family will no doubt be called \"extenuating circumstances\" when it comes to his sentencing. To my mind there is no difference between torturing an American criminal who commits horrendous acts, and a political criminal who commits horrendous acts. Fifty years ago, the police in America would routinely use the \"Third degree\" to extract information. And you know what? It worked. Everyone confessed... We are fortunate to have trained interogation teams in both the military and the Police. While the Third degree worked, it didn't give us information worth a damn. Yet the skilled interogators of the military and the police can worm informaton out of a brick. Now I posted a thread on this topic - You really ought to read it. It's one thing to go ballistic about danger to your beloved, it's another to cut off your nose to spite your face. http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/672198221/m/1930072222001 Dave",
