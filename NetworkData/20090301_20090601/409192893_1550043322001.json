If you don't know how the bond market works, then you won't get it. When the company goes into bankruptcy, which Chrysler has done because the President ordered it, after already giving them a ton of our money(good business sense says to let it go to begin with, the company and the holding company has a contract to insure that the investors will take an agreed to loss. The bond holders were told that they were going to take a bigger loss, and like it, thus breaking the contract.

I mean, both parties agree on product and price. When the mob goes in to collect protection money, there is no crime...because the business owner agrees to pay so he doesn't get his legs broken. No crime there...both parties agree.... false analogy is false.

If you don't know how the bond market works, then you won't get it. When the company goes into bankruptcy, which Chrysler has done because the President ordered it, after already giving them a ton of our money(good business sense says to let it go to begin with, the company and the holding company has a contract to insure that the investors will take an agreed to loss. The bond holders were told that they were going to take a bigger loss, and like it, thus breaking the contract.

If you don't know how the bond market works, then you won't get it. When the company goes into bankruptcy, which Chrysler has done because the President ordered it, after already giving them a ton of our money(good business sense says to let it go to begin with, the company and the holding company has a contract to insure that the investors will take an agreed to loss. The bond holders were told that they were going to take a bigger loss, and like it, thus breaking the contract.

If you don't know how the bond market works, then you won't get it. When the company goes into bankruptcy, which Chrysler has done because the President ordered it, after already giving them a ton of our money(good business sense says to let it go to begin with, the company and the holding company has a contract to insure that the investors will take an agreed to loss. The bond holders were told that they were going to take a bigger loss, and like it, thus breaking the contract.
