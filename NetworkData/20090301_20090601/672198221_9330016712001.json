Now where have I pointed out other people's partisanship at every turn? And you, in your sarcasm, are spot on. I don't hate Obama ... hope he is fully successful in quite a number of his agenda items ... private accounts to supplement social security, Afghanistan, a systematic drawdown in Iraq, eliminating wasteful spending, and the list goes on. What I do hate is his seeming abdication of much of his agenda to Congressional scribes ... who I believe have eroded his high ground. You may disagree ... but you ought to be able to do it without engaging in ad hominems. I suppose Axelrod is a \"hater\" too ... quote: White House aides said they debated whether the president should sign an omnibus spending bill that includes more than 8,500 pet projects worth $7.7 billion. White House counselor David Axelrod suggested a veto would send a strong signal that Mr. Obama's Washington really would represent change. But the president decided it wasn't worth adding a fight with his own party onto a plate that is already overly filled.",
