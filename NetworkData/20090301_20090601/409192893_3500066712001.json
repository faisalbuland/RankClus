Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill.

Why, because if I have it there is an opportunity for the gvmnt to recoup some of the cost for treating me. This has been an ongoing look see as per this study done back in 2000. quote: Research Objective: Veterans who use the Veterans' Health Administration (VA) may have other health care coverage such as Medicare or private insurance. Previous studies have examined VA and Medicare dual users, but little is known about VA patients' private insurance status. This study uses a unique survey of VA patients to determine the level of other insurance coverage VA patients have and their patterns of VA and non-VA care.Study Design: We used the '1999 Health Survey of Veterans' data, by far the largest and most detailed survey of veterans using VA services ever conducted, to assess the insurance coverage and compare the degree of using VA and non-VA care by insurance coverage categories for 175,276 VA users (overall response rate of 61%). We grouped individuals into Medicare and non-Medicare categories. For the Medicare sample, we identified whether they had Medigap or enrolled in HMOs. For the non-Medicare sample, we identified whether they had private insurance. For people who used inpatient care in the 3 months preceding the survey, we identified veterans as VA, non-VA, and dual users. We also examined outpatient care in the same fashion. Population Studied: A random sample of veteran users of the Veterans Health Administration.Principal Findings: Seventy six percent of veterans who use VA services have some other type of health care coverage. Sixty-one percent are enrolled in Medicare and another 15% have private insurance. Of the Medicare enrollees, 42% have additional Medigap insurance; 13% are in Medicare HMOs. VA patients report considerable health utilization: 21% had inpatient care and 72% used outpatient services in the 3 months preceding the survey. Those with Medicare coverage used more inpatient and outpatient care than the non-Medicare user population, but were more likely to use non-VA care (e.g., 40% compared to 26% of non-Medicare enrollees used only non-VA inpatient care).VETERANS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE (WHETHER MEDIGAP - 56% -- OR OTHER -55%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INPATIENT CARE OUTSIDE VA. MEDICARE ENROLLEES WITHOUT MEDIGAP COVERAGE USED VA HEAVILY (56% USING VA ONLY, 28% USING ONLY NON-VA CARE AND 16% USING BOTH SYSTEMS) AND AS MUCH AS 74% OF THE NON-MEDICARE SAMPLE WITHOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE GOT ALL OF THEIR INPATIENT CARE FROM VA. FOR VETERANS WHO HAD MEDIGAP OR OTHER PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE, 30% RECEIVED CARE ONLY FROM VA WHILE ANOTHER 14% USED VA ALONGSIDE PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH CARE. THESE PATTERNS OF UTILIZATION WERE SIMILAR FOR OUTPATIENT VISITS. Conclusions: Out of the total veteran population using VA services, those enrolled in Medicare use more services than the non-Medicare population but the latter are more likely to seek care from VA. Further, VA is clearly a safety net for veterans without any other (public or private) insurance coverage. However, VA also provides a great deal of care to veterans with alternative sources of health care coverage. Implications for Policy, Delivery and Practice: Understanding the patterns of veterans' insurance and utilization of VA and Medicare services can help policy makers better manage care and allocate funding. This comprehensive data also provides information on potential revenue that the VA can bill private insurers for those services rendered through private coverage.Primary Funding Source: Office of Quality and Performance (10Q) and Health Services Research and Development Service, Veterans Health Administration U.S. National Institutes of Health Does anyone belive that care WILL NOT be affored a veteran just because he has other insurance that could be used to help pay for his treatment?

Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I.

The site sounds like a good idea, but only if the bill is completely outlined. Often a good intentioned bill gets so many ear marks, it must be voted against. Without that info, the site is unfair. No doubt, if a bill is any kind of entitlement, the Dem votes will outnumber the Rep. If it's a guns and ammo concern, or a national security issue, the Reps will almost outnumber the Dems.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by cybercafe: If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

No doubt, if a bill is any kind of entitlement, the Dem votes will outnumber the Rep. If it's a guns and ammo concern, or a national security issue, the Reps will almost outnumber the Dems.",

        "content": "If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

        "reply": "If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

Why, because if I have it there is an opportunity for the gvmnt to recoup some of the cost for treating me. This has been an ongoing look see as per this study done back in 2000. quote: Research Objective: Veterans who use the Veterans' Health Administration (VA) may have other health care coverage such as Medicare or private insurance. Previous studies have examined VA and Medicare dual users, but little is known about VA patients' private insurance status. This study uses a unique survey of VA patients to determine the level of other insurance coverage VA patients have and their patterns of VA and non-VA care.Study Design: We used the '1999 Health Survey of Veterans' data, by far the largest and most detailed survey of veterans using VA services ever conducted, to assess the insurance coverage and compare the degree of using VA and non-VA care by insurance coverage categories for 175,276 VA users (overall response rate of 61%). We grouped individuals into Medicare and non-Medicare categories. For the Medicare sample, we identified whether they had Medigap or enrolled in HMOs. For the non-Medicare sample, we identified whether they had private insurance. For people who used inpatient care in the 3 months preceding the survey, we identified veterans as VA, non-VA, and dual users. We also examined outpatient care in the same fashion. Population Studied: A random sample of veteran users of the Veterans Health Administration.Principal Findings: Seventy six percent of veterans who use VA services have some other type of health care coverage. Sixty-one percent are enrolled in Medicare and another 15% have private insurance. Of the Medicare enrollees, 42% have additional Medigap insurance; 13% are in Medicare HMOs. VA patients report considerable health utilization: 21% had inpatient care and 72% used outpatient services in the 3 months preceding the survey. Those with Medicare coverage used more inpatient and outpatient care than the non-Medicare user population, but were more likely to use non-VA care (e.g., 40% compared to 26% of non-Medicare enrollees used only non-VA inpatient care).VETERANS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE (WHETHER MEDIGAP - 56% -- OR OTHER -55%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INPATIENT CARE OUTSIDE VA. MEDICARE ENROLLEES WITHOUT MEDIGAP COVERAGE USED VA HEAVILY (56% USING VA ONLY, 28% USING ONLY NON-VA CARE AND 16% USING BOTH SYSTEMS) AND AS MUCH AS 74% OF THE NON-MEDICARE SAMPLE WITHOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE GOT ALL OF THEIR INPATIENT CARE FROM VA. FOR VETERANS WHO HAD MEDIGAP OR OTHER PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE, 30% RECEIVED CARE ONLY FROM VA WHILE ANOTHER 14% USED VA ALONGSIDE PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH CARE. THESE PATTERNS OF UTILIZATION WERE SIMILAR FOR OUTPATIENT VISITS. Conclusions: Out of the total veteran population using VA services, those enrolled in Medicare use more services than the non-Medicare population but the latter are more likely to seek care from VA. Further, VA is clearly a safety net for veterans without any other (public or private) insurance coverage. However, VA also provides a great deal of care to veterans with alternative sources of health care coverage. Implications for Policy, Delivery and Practice: Understanding the patterns of veterans' insurance and utilization of VA and Medicare services can help policy makers better manage care and allocate funding. This comprehensive data also provides information on potential revenue that the VA can bill private insurers for those services rendered through private coverage.Primary Funding Source: Office of Quality and Performance (10Q) and Health Services Research and Development Service, Veterans Health Administration U.S. National Institutes of Health Does anyone belive that care WILL NOT be affored a veteran just because he has other insurance that could be used to help pay for his treatment?

The site sounds like a good idea, but only if the bill is completely outlined. Often a good intentioned bill gets so many ear marks, it must be voted against. Without that info, the site is unfair. No doubt, if a bill is any kind of entitlement, the Dem votes will outnumber the Rep. If it's a guns and ammo concern, or a national security issue, the Reps will almost outnumber the Dems.",

Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I.

        "reply": "If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

Why, because if I have it there is an opportunity for the gvmnt to recoup some of the cost for treating me. This has been an ongoing look see as per this study done back in 2000. quote: Research Objective: Veterans who use the Veterans' Health Administration (VA) may have other health care coverage such as Medicare or private insurance. Previous studies have examined VA and Medicare dual users, but little is known about VA patients' private insurance status. This study uses a unique survey of VA patients to determine the level of other insurance coverage VA patients have and their patterns of VA and non-VA care.Study Design: We used the '1999 Health Survey of Veterans' data, by far the largest and most detailed survey of veterans using VA services ever conducted, to assess the insurance coverage and compare the degree of using VA and non-VA care by insurance coverage categories for 175,276 VA users (overall response rate of 61%). We grouped individuals into Medicare and non-Medicare categories. For the Medicare sample, we identified whether they had Medigap or enrolled in HMOs. For the non-Medicare sample, we identified whether they had private insurance. For people who used inpatient care in the 3 months preceding the survey, we identified veterans as VA, non-VA, and dual users. We also examined outpatient care in the same fashion. Population Studied: A random sample of veteran users of the Veterans Health Administration.Principal Findings: Seventy six percent of veterans who use VA services have some other type of health care coverage. Sixty-one percent are enrolled in Medicare and another 15% have private insurance. Of the Medicare enrollees, 42% have additional Medigap insurance; 13% are in Medicare HMOs. VA patients report considerable health utilization: 21% had inpatient care and 72% used outpatient services in the 3 months preceding the survey. Those with Medicare coverage used more inpatient and outpatient care than the non-Medicare user population, but were more likely to use non-VA care (e.g., 40% compared to 26% of non-Medicare enrollees used only non-VA inpatient care).VETERANS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE (WHETHER MEDIGAP - 56% -- OR OTHER -55%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INPATIENT CARE OUTSIDE VA. MEDICARE ENROLLEES WITHOUT MEDIGAP COVERAGE USED VA HEAVILY (56% USING VA ONLY, 28% USING ONLY NON-VA CARE AND 16% USING BOTH SYSTEMS) AND AS MUCH AS 74% OF THE NON-MEDICARE SAMPLE WITHOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE GOT ALL OF THEIR INPATIENT CARE FROM VA. FOR VETERANS WHO HAD MEDIGAP OR OTHER PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE, 30% RECEIVED CARE ONLY FROM VA WHILE ANOTHER 14% USED VA ALONGSIDE PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH CARE. THESE PATTERNS OF UTILIZATION WERE SIMILAR FOR OUTPATIENT VISITS. Conclusions: Out of the total veteran population using VA services, those enrolled in Medicare use more services than the non-Medicare population but the latter are more likely to seek care from VA. Further, VA is clearly a safety net for veterans without any other (public or private) insurance coverage. However, VA also provides a great deal of care to veterans with alternative sources of health care coverage. Implications for Policy, Delivery and Practice: Understanding the patterns of veterans' insurance and utilization of VA and Medicare services can help policy makers better manage care and allocate funding. This comprehensive data also provides information on potential revenue that the VA can bill private insurers for those services rendered through private coverage.Primary Funding Source: Office of Quality and Performance (10Q) and Health Services Research and Development Service, Veterans Health Administration U.S. National Institutes of Health Does anyone belive that care WILL NOT be affored a veteran just because he has other insurance that could be used to help pay for his treatment?

Now I never enrolled in nor ever sought other insurance, other than the Navy Corpsmen that accompanied us, my health care was the US Navy or US Army Or US Air Force, who ever was closest. I have no other insurance nor am i even eligible to obtain it, i can see it now during exam and the question or pre existing conditions comes up.

Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

        "quote": "Originally posted by cybercafe: If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I.

        "content": "Nothing new in this. When I use the local Army clinic I'm always asked if I have other insurance. Why, because if I have it there is an opportunity for the gvmnt to recoup some of the cost for treating me. This has been an ongoing look see as per this study done back in 2000. quote: Research Objective: Veterans who use the Veterans' Health Administration (VA) may have other health care coverage such as Medicare or private insurance. Previous studies have examined VA and Medicare dual users, but little is known about VA patients' private insurance status. This study uses a unique survey of VA patients to determine the level of other insurance coverage VA patients have and their patterns of VA and non-VA care.Study Design: We used the '1999 Health Survey of Veterans' data, by far the largest and most detailed survey of veterans using VA services ever conducted, to assess the insurance coverage and compare the degree of using VA and non-VA care by insurance coverage categories for 175,276 VA users (overall response rate of 61%). We grouped individuals into Medicare and non-Medicare categories. For the Medicare sample, we identified whether they had Medigap or enrolled in HMOs. For the non-Medicare sample, we identified whether they had private insurance. For people who used inpatient care in the 3 months preceding the survey, we identified veterans as VA, non-VA, and dual users. We also examined outpatient care in the same fashion. Population Studied: A random sample of veteran users of the Veterans Health Administration.Principal Findings: Seventy six percent of veterans who use VA services have some other type of health care coverage. Sixty-one percent are enrolled in Medicare and another 15% have private insurance. Of the Medicare enrollees, 42% have additional Medigap insurance; 13% are in Medicare HMOs. VA patients report considerable health utilization: 21% had inpatient care and 72% used outpatient services in the 3 months preceding the survey. Those with Medicare coverage used more inpatient and outpatient care than the non-Medicare user population, but were more likely to use non-VA care (e.g., 40% compared to 26% of non-Medicare enrollees used only non-VA inpatient care).VETERANS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE (WHETHER MEDIGAP - 56% -- OR OTHER -55%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INPATIENT CARE OUTSIDE VA. MEDICARE ENROLLEES WITHOUT MEDIGAP COVERAGE USED VA HEAVILY (56% USING VA ONLY, 28% USING ONLY NON-VA CARE AND 16% USING BOTH SYSTEMS) AND AS MUCH AS 74% OF THE NON-MEDICARE SAMPLE WITHOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE GOT ALL OF THEIR INPATIENT CARE FROM VA.

        "quote": "Research Objective: Veterans who use the Veterans' Health Administration (VA) may have other health care coverage such as Medicare or private insurance. Previous studies have examined VA and Medicare dual users, but little is known about VA patients' private insurance status. This study uses a unique survey of VA patients to determine the level of other insurance coverage VA patients have and their patterns of VA and non-VA care.Study Design: We used the '1999 Health Survey of Veterans' data, by far the largest and most detailed survey of veterans using VA services ever conducted, to assess the insurance coverage and compare the degree of using VA and non-VA care by insurance coverage categories for 175,276 VA users (overall response rate of 61%). We grouped individuals into Medicare and non-Medicare categories. For the Medicare sample, we identified whether they had Medigap or enrolled in HMOs. For the non-Medicare sample, we identified whether they had private insurance. For people who used inpatient care in the 3 months preceding the survey, we identified veterans as VA, non-VA, and dual users. We also examined outpatient care in the same fashion. Population Studied: A random sample of veteran users of the Veterans Health Administration.Principal Findings: Seventy six percent of veterans who use VA services have some other type of health care coverage. Sixty-one percent are enrolled in Medicare and another 15% have private insurance. Of the Medicare enrollees, 42% have additional Medigap insurance; 13% are in Medicare HMOs. VA patients report considerable health utilization: 21% had inpatient care and 72% used outpatient services in the 3 months preceding the survey. Those with Medicare coverage used more inpatient and outpatient care than the non-Medicare user population, but were more likely to use non-VA care (e.g., 40% compared to 26% of non-Medicare enrollees used only non-VA inpatient care).VETERANS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE (WHETHER MEDIGAP - 56% -- OR OTHER -55%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INPATIENT CARE OUTSIDE VA.

Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I.

[QUOTE]Originally posted by cybercafe: If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. The site sounds like a good idea, but only if the bill is completely outlined. Often a good intentioned bill gets so many ear marks, it must be voted against. Without that info, the site is unfair. No doubt, if a bill is any kind of entitlement, the Dem votes will outnumber the Rep. If it's a guns and ammo concern, or a national security issue, the Reps will almost outnumber the Dems.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by cybercafe: If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

The site sounds like a good idea, but only if the bill is completely outlined. Often a good intentioned bill gets so many ear marks, it must be voted against. Without that info, the site is unfair. No doubt, if a bill is any kind of entitlement, the Dem votes will outnumber the Rep. If it's a guns and ammo concern, or a national security issue, the Reps will almost outnumber the Dems.",

        "content": "If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

        "reply": "If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

Why, because if I have it there is an opportunity for the gvmnt to recoup some of the cost for treating me. This has been an ongoing look see as per this study done back in 2000. quote: Research Objective: Veterans who use the Veterans' Health Administration (VA) may have other health care coverage such as Medicare or private insurance. Previous studies have examined VA and Medicare dual users, but little is known about VA patients' private insurance status. This study uses a unique survey of VA patients to determine the level of other insurance coverage VA patients have and their patterns of VA and non-VA care.Study Design: We used the '1999 Health Survey of Veterans' data, by far the largest and most detailed survey of veterans using VA services ever conducted, to assess the insurance coverage and compare the degree of using VA and non-VA care by insurance coverage categories for 175,276 VA users (overall response rate of 61%). We grouped individuals into Medicare and non-Medicare categories. For the Medicare sample, we identified whether they had Medigap or enrolled in HMOs. For the non-Medicare sample, we identified whether they had private insurance. For people who used inpatient care in the 3 months preceding the survey, we identified veterans as VA, non-VA, and dual users. We also examined outpatient care in the same fashion. Population Studied: A random sample of veteran users of the Veterans Health Administration.Principal Findings: Seventy six percent of veterans who use VA services have some other type of health care coverage. Sixty-one percent are enrolled in Medicare and another 15% have private insurance. Of the Medicare enrollees, 42% have additional Medigap insurance; 13% are in Medicare HMOs. VA patients report considerable health utilization: 21% had inpatient care and 72% used outpatient services in the 3 months preceding the survey. Those with Medicare coverage used more inpatient and outpatient care than the non-Medicare user population, but were more likely to use non-VA care (e.g., 40% compared to 26% of non-Medicare enrollees used only non-VA inpatient care).VETERANS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE (WHETHER MEDIGAP - 56% -- OR OTHER -55%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INPATIENT CARE OUTSIDE VA. MEDICARE ENROLLEES WITHOUT MEDIGAP COVERAGE USED VA HEAVILY (56% USING VA ONLY, 28% USING ONLY NON-VA CARE AND 16% USING BOTH SYSTEMS) AND AS MUCH AS 74% OF THE NON-MEDICARE SAMPLE WITHOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE GOT ALL OF THEIR INPATIENT CARE FROM VA. FOR VETERANS WHO HAD MEDIGAP OR OTHER PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE, 30% RECEIVED CARE ONLY FROM VA WHILE ANOTHER 14% USED VA ALONGSIDE PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH CARE. THESE PATTERNS OF UTILIZATION WERE SIMILAR FOR OUTPATIENT VISITS. Conclusions: Out of the total veteran population using VA services, those enrolled in Medicare use more services than the non-Medicare population but the latter are more likely to seek care from VA. Further, VA is clearly a safety net for veterans without any other (public or private) insurance coverage. However, VA also provides a great deal of care to veterans with alternative sources of health care coverage. Implications for Policy, Delivery and Practice: Understanding the patterns of veterans' insurance and utilization of VA and Medicare services can help policy makers better manage care and allocate funding. This comprehensive data also provides information on potential revenue that the VA can bill private insurers for those services rendered through private coverage.Primary Funding Source: Office of Quality and Performance (10Q) and Health Services Research and Development Service, Veterans Health Administration U.S. National Institutes of Health Does anyone belive that care WILL NOT be affored a veteran just because he has other insurance that could be used to help pay for his treatment?

The groups also cited an increase in \u201cthird-party collections\u201d estimated in the 2010 budget proposal \u2014 something they said could be achieved only if the Veterans Administration started billing for service-related injuries. Asked about the proposal, Shinseki said it was under \u201cconsideration.\u201d \u201cA final decision hasn\u2019t been made yet,\u201d he said. I would think a lot of conservative vets would be happy about this - after all, isn't the VA, and for that matter the whole military medical system - socialized medicine? In other words - \"Socialism\"? www Vetvoice.com no just because we have social programs dosent mean it is socialism.. you people dems mainly are confused by this and is why we are getting so screwed... and by that i mean trying to turn our gov from capitalism to socialism... but we will find out the hard way that socialism dosent work but it will cost our country greatly... but dont worry ill be right here to tell you all i told you so...",

In other words - \"Socialism\"? www Vetvoice.com It's just a scam to reduce the fed budget. The publics pays for the Vet's care regardless if it's service connected. Passing the cost off to the insurance company is just a way to make the budget look better. I'm a trouble shooter for an electric utility, and when some mishaps have happened, they paid the bill. When I incurred a 60% service connected disability, my employer at that time, Uncle Sam, is supposed to do the same, as promised. I believe I have a legal contract with both employers.",

The site sounds like a good idea, but only if the bill is completely outlined. Often a good intentioned bill gets so many ear marks, it must be voted against. Without that info, the site is unfair. No doubt, if a bill is any kind of entitlement, the Dem votes will outnumber the Rep. If it's a guns and ammo concern, or a national security issue, the Reps will almost outnumber the Dems.",

Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

        "reply": "If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

Why, because if I have it there is an opportunity for the gvmnt to recoup some of the cost for treating me. This has been an ongoing look see as per this study done back in 2000. quote: Research Objective: Veterans who use the Veterans' Health Administration (VA) may have other health care coverage such as Medicare or private insurance. Previous studies have examined VA and Medicare dual users, but little is known about VA patients' private insurance status. This study uses a unique survey of VA patients to determine the level of other insurance coverage VA patients have and their patterns of VA and non-VA care.Study Design: We used the '1999 Health Survey of Veterans' data, by far the largest and most detailed survey of veterans using VA services ever conducted, to assess the insurance coverage and compare the degree of using VA and non-VA care by insurance coverage categories for 175,276 VA users (overall response rate of 61%). We grouped individuals into Medicare and non-Medicare categories. For the Medicare sample, we identified whether they had Medigap or enrolled in HMOs. For the non-Medicare sample, we identified whether they had private insurance. For people who used inpatient care in the 3 months preceding the survey, we identified veterans as VA, non-VA, and dual users. We also examined outpatient care in the same fashion. Population Studied: A random sample of veteran users of the Veterans Health Administration.Principal Findings: Seventy six percent of veterans who use VA services have some other type of health care coverage. Sixty-one percent are enrolled in Medicare and another 15% have private insurance. Of the Medicare enrollees, 42% have additional Medigap insurance; 13% are in Medicare HMOs. VA patients report considerable health utilization: 21% had inpatient care and 72% used outpatient services in the 3 months preceding the survey. Those with Medicare coverage used more inpatient and outpatient care than the non-Medicare user population, but were more likely to use non-VA care (e.g., 40% compared to 26% of non-Medicare enrollees used only non-VA inpatient care).VETERANS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE (WHETHER MEDIGAP - 56% -- OR OTHER -55%) WERE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK INPATIENT CARE OUTSIDE VA. MEDICARE ENROLLEES WITHOUT MEDIGAP COVERAGE USED VA HEAVILY (56% USING VA ONLY, 28% USING ONLY NON-VA CARE AND 16% USING BOTH SYSTEMS) AND AS MUCH AS 74% OF THE NON-MEDICARE SAMPLE WITHOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE GOT ALL OF THEIR INPATIENT CARE FROM VA. FOR VETERANS WHO HAD MEDIGAP OR OTHER PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE, 30% RECEIVED CARE ONLY FROM VA WHILE ANOTHER 14% USED VA ALONGSIDE PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH CARE. THESE PATTERNS OF UTILIZATION WERE SIMILAR FOR OUTPATIENT VISITS. Conclusions: Out of the total veteran population using VA services, those enrolled in Medicare use more services than the non-Medicare population but the latter are more likely to seek care from VA. Further, VA is clearly a safety net for veterans without any other (public or private) insurance coverage. However, VA also provides a great deal of care to veterans with alternative sources of health care coverage. Implications for Policy, Delivery and Practice: Understanding the patterns of veterans' insurance and utilization of VA and Medicare services can help policy makers better manage care and allocate funding. This comprehensive data also provides information on potential revenue that the VA can bill private insurers for those services rendered through private coverage.Primary Funding Source: Office of Quality and Performance (10Q) and Health Services Research and Development Service, Veterans Health Administration U.S. National Institutes of Health Does anyone belive that care WILL NOT be affored a veteran just because he has other insurance that could be used to help pay for his treatment?

Now I never enrolled in nor ever sought other insurance, other than the Navy Corpsmen that accompanied us, my health care was the US Navy or US Army Or US Air Force, who ever was closest. I have no other insurance nor am i even eligible to obtain it, i can see it now during exam and the question or pre existing conditions comes up.

Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.

        "quote": "Originally posted by cybercafe: If you want to find out weather or not its the Republicans or Democrats who support Veterans, go to the website, follow the instructions given, and look at the sample of information I posted. Log on to: \"www.votesmart.org.\" So the first step for everyone on this forum is to log on to the website I gave Here is one example of a Democratic Senator who supports Veterans: \"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=19243&can_id=4295\" Now, the next step, is: scroll down to where it says: Veterans issues. The next step is: click on any measure that supports Veterans, such as the GI bill expansion and other domestic provisions. The next step is: click on: How members voted. After you click on How members voted, you will get a breakdown of people who voted Yes or no. There is also another colum that lists the political party of the person who voted yes or no. From there, compare and contrast how many Republicans v. Democrats voted Yes or no. Do this with every Veterans' issue. You might be able to identify every single candidate who voted Yes on every single veterans' issue. That might be the candidate to lobby for any controversial bill. I hope Veterans put this website to good use. Here is one sample: National Key Vote (How all members voted) G.I. Bill Expansion and Other Domestic Provisions Key Votes: HR 2642: S Amdt 4818: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan S Amdt 4817: Funding for Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with Provisions Regarding Conduct and Congressional Oversight S Amdt 4803: GI Bill and Other Domestic Provisions Issues: Budget, Spending and Taxes, Education, Foreign Aid and Policy Issues, Senior and Social Security Issues, Veterans Issues, Welfare and Poverty Date: 05/15/2008 Sponsor: Rep.
