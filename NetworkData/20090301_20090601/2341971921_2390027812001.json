I'm talking about Iraq and the crimes of the old regime there - specifically the security apparatus of the Mukhabarat. Not only did they torture and murder thousands of individuals, but they often videotaped their awful crimes. And here's where you can come in. It has been reported that copies of these tapes are freely available in Iraq on CD and DVD, it was even possible to buy them at the market a few years back. If anyone out there in Iraq could get hold of even one video it would help preserve the memory of those who fell into the murderous hands of the regime. This has become even more urgent now that we are entering the endgame of the war in Iraq and troops are pulling out, and if possible, it would be useful to gather as many of these videos as possible before the final whistle blows. If worried about being caught with any of the material it may be best to upload them to a file site, for retrieval at a later date.",
