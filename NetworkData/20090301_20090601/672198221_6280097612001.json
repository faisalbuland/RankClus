Waste in making so much military equipment that production has to be 'donated to the poor' is something else. It can actually 'go bad' if it's best before date is exceeded. It usually isn't worth recycling, and makes hellish land (or ocean) fill. Better to build the domestic poor a free house, provide cradle to grave medicare and educate every kid for nothing. It creates more jobs, isn't hazardous to life and it's cheaper, too.",
