And for the record I consider BBC Newsnight to be a reputable current affairs programme (not an entertainment \"show\"), I have almost certainly read articles on the subject but that report happened to stick in my mind as a known source. BTW my knowledge of the Balkans does encompass television news and documentaries but it also includes, newspapers, books and the personal experience of myself and others. An RSM of my aquaintance summed up the Serb PSV myth thus, \"They'd say they'd been victimised by a man if they'd got blood on their boots while kicking him to death.\" According to Estonian Law (am sure Latvian as well), all minorities who either emigrated to, or were born in Estonia after 1940 MUST take a test in order to become citizens; hence vote & participate in political process! In contrast, all former citizens of USSR can become citizens of RF by simply filling out a request! But the Russians in the Baltic states didn't think of themselves as Latvians or Estonians or whatever did they? They were Russians or Soviets so when the USSR fell those Russians remaining, even those born there, were in (eg) Estonia but not of Estonia. It is therefore not surprising that Estonia treated them as immigrants when they tried to join its citizenry. I wonder if this test is so onerous as to be too difficult for Russians to take or whether they just don't want to. If DC sent me a notice telling me all of the sudden I must take a test to prove I\u2019m worthy of a citizenship, my answer would be short and to the point.....go **** yourself!

You are \u201cfairly sure\u201d and keep referencing \u201cshows\u201d on TV! And you accuse me of falling for myths! Does your knowledge of the Balkans (Serbs) extend as far as your \u201ctelly\u201d as well? [COLOR:GREEN]\"Fairly sure\" is my way of saying that I'm pretty much certain but can't find a reference because BBC News only stores video reports for a few weeks. And for the record I consider BBC Newsnight to be a reputable current affairs programme (not an entertainment \"show\"), I have almost certainly read articles on the subject but that report happened to stick in my mind as a known source. BTW my knowledge of the Balkans does encompass television news and documentaries but it also includes, newspapers, books and the personal experience of myself and others. An RSM of my aquaintance summed up the Serb PSV myth thus, \"They'd say they'd been victimised by a man if they'd got blood on their boots while kicking him to death.\" According to Estonian Law (am sure Latvian as well), all minorities who either emigrated to, or were born in Estonia after 1940 MUST take a test in order to become citizens; hence vote & participate in political process! In contrast, all former citizens of USSR can become citizens of RF by simply filling out a request! But the Russians in the Baltic states didn't think of themselves as Latvians or Estonians or whatever did they? They were Russians or Soviets so when the USSR fell those Russians remaining, even those born there, were in (eg) Estonia but not of Estonia. It is therefore not surprising that Estonia treated them as immigrants when they tried to join its citizenry. I wonder if this test is so onerous as to be too difficult for Russians to take or whether they just don't want to. If DC sent me a notice telling me all of the sudden I must take a test to prove I\u2019m worthy of a citizenship, my answer would be short and to the point.....go **** yourself! [/color] The EU has on occasion come down fairly heavily of the Baltics for discrimination however given that much of the agitation is seen as coming from Moscow, and Putin not exactly being seen as a saint (eastern Europe developed a deep loathing for him when people started dying after he cut off the gas last winter) the larger mamber states are unwilling to be seen to do anything that would be seen as a victory by the Kremlin. For the third time; these issues arose as soon as the Baltic states got their independence....long before Putin and assertive Russia of today! And for the umpteenth time the Russians in the Baltic states were havering back towards the Kremlin as soon as those states got their independence. They'd had the whip hand for half a century don't forget and probably had every reason to feel threatened.",
