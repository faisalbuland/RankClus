His chain of command is completely responsible for this, its their fault this moron snapped and killed men.. Irwin: \"It's their fault this moron snapped and killed men\"? An interesting logic on your part. Suppose he had a mental problem, nothing to do with the war, his assignment, his duties, his performance, etc. Many of us have heard of similar incidents, probably not as serious as this one, seemingly without justification and often without warning. However, long before you know the facts, you want to hang those in his immediate chain of command. Sorry, but I prefer to see him held accountable for his actions and allow the system (UCMJ/mental health evaluation/etc) to determine cause and responsibility. Jack",

There is only so much we can do, and often a person can internalize issues and seem just fine. A Soldier in another company in my battalion killed himself there and nobody saw it coming.",
