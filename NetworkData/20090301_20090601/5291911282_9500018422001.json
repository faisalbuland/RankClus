I have done my homework and talked to friends of mine that are techs and SEALS that they are attached to. I am prior service Navy and want to go Navy or Army EOD. Now here is the trouble. I have an SFJ-RE2 code. I was medically retired for my right foot. Ive had operations while on active duty and ran out of LIMDU time to get better. I have since recovered and am confident I am %100. I have been working with motivators and training pretty damn hard because I really want this. My question. What are my chances of getting back in and accepted in this program? And what steps would I need to take? I am not worried about the physical part. I know how difficult the course work is to those that do NOT have good study habbits. Again, I am prepared for this and I have done my homework. This might have to be answered by those salty sailors that have been dealing with these situations.",
