I came across this video for Pat McGee\u2019s \u201cCome Back Home\u201d on a MilBlog that I follow and wanted to share it with you all, I know you'd appreciate it.

Mainedawg Moderator \"\u2019Come Back Home\u2019 was written in the wake of me losing my longtime drummer and former Army soldier John C. Williams. But the song started off as a reflection of how a military couple deals with separation. After the release of \u2018Come Back Home,\u2019 John\u2019s little brother was killed by an IED in Iraq. His name was Blake Williams. His platoon used this track as the audio to a memorial slide show presentation they did in March of 2008. It was for all the courageous men and women they had lost in the month of March. I am humbled by their service to our great country and I hope this song brings them some peace. My father served in Vietnam and I truly appreciate their dedication and bravery.\" - Pat McGee Thanks for watching, as well as for your never-ending commitment to our troops.
