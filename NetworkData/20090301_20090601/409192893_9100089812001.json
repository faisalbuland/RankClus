Oh come on now, find another play book will you? This whole Nazi/conservative/GOP thing belongs in the X-Files. If you have any reading comprehension at all, then you'll note that your last paragraph has democrat party written all over it. The Conservative firmly believes in individual liberty and freedom. He does NOT advocate \"volk community\" such as \"It takes a village...\". \"Rooted in the soil and united by the bond of it's common blood\" sounds pretty idealistic with more than a hint of racism.
