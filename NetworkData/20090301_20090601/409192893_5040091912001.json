Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do. Last summer, then-candidate Barack Obama threw civil liberties to the wind when he proposed \u201ca civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded\u201d as the regular military. The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students. The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling.

Ah, yes. How I remember those halcyon days.

        "content": "What is the AmeriCorps Program? AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities.

The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I.

Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

        "reply": "What is the AmeriCorps Program? AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO.

The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do. Last summer, then-candidate Barack Obama threw civil liberties to the wind when he proposed \u201ca civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded\u201d as the regular military. The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students. The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling. Sounds like a government curriculum for government approved \u201cservice learning,\u201d which is nothing less than indoctrination. Now, ask yourself if congressmen who voted for this monstrosity had a clue what they were voting for. If not, they\u2019re guilty of dereliction of duty. If yes, the implications are truly frightening.

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

Call it France 1792, Russia 1917, Germany 1933, China 1949--while those instances are obviously worse, this kind of collectivism is a distinct danger to freedom. Nothing about the obamanation gives any patriot comfort that this latest scheme shall certainly be of real good to the nation as a whole. It just goes hand-in-hand with Geithner's wish to usurp excessive power and control from the People of the United States, in the name of protecting us from us. Thanks, anyway, bubbas.",

The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do. Last summer, then-candidate Barack Obama threw civil liberties to the wind when he proposed \u201ca civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded\u201d as the regular military. The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students.

        "content": "What is the AmeriCorps Program? AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Kegler300: This concept has been tried once before in the 1930\u2019s by the Germans; it started out innocent enough and quickly turned into the Third Reich and the birth of the Nazi\u2019s. quote: Expanded Americorps has an authoritarian feel By Examiner Editorial - 3/26/09 With almost no public attention, both chambers of Congress in the past week advanced an alarming expansion of the Americorps national service plan, with the number of federally funded community service job increasing from 75,000 to 250,000 at a cost of $5.7 billion. Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do. Last summer, then-candidate Barack Obama threw civil liberties to the wind when he proposed \u201ca civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded\u201d as the regular military. The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students. The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all.

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life.

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle.

Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do. Last summer, then-candidate Barack Obama threw civil liberties to the wind when he proposed \u201ca civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded\u201d as the regular military. The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students. The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling. Sounds like a government curriculum for government approved \u201cservice learning,\u201d which is nothing less than indoctrination. Now, ask yourself if congressmen who voted for this monstrosity had a clue what they were voting for. If not, they\u2019re guilty of dereliction of duty. If yes, the implications are truly frightening. Source: \"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Expanded-Americorps-has-an-authoritarian-feel-41889742.html\" \"The World's Finest\"",

Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do. Last summer, then-candidate Barack Obama threw civil liberties to the wind when he proposed \u201ca civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded\u201d as the regular military. The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students. The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling. Sounds like a government curriculum for government approved \u201cservice learning,\u201d which is nothing less than indoctrination. Now, ask yourself if congressmen who voted for this monstrosity had a clue what they were voting for. If not, they\u2019re guilty of dereliction of duty. If yes, the implications are truly frightening. Source: \"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Expanded-Americorps-has-an-authoritarian-feel-41889742.html\"",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Kegler300: This concept has been tried once before in the 1930\u2019s by the Germans; it started out innocent enough and quickly turned into the Third Reich and the birth of the Nazi\u2019s. quote: Expanded Americorps has an authoritarian feel By Examiner Editorial - 3/26/09 With almost no public attention, both chambers of Congress in the past week advanced an alarming expansion of the Americorps national service plan, with the number of federally funded community service job increasing from 75,000 to 250,000 at a cost of $5.7 billion. Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do. Last summer, then-candidate Barack Obama threw civil liberties to the wind when he proposed \u201ca civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded\u201d as the regular military. The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students. The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling. Sounds like a government curriculum for government approved \u201cservice learning,\u201d which is nothing less than indoctrination. Now, ask yourself if congressmen who voted for this monstrosity had a clue what they were voting for. If not, they\u2019re guilty of dereliction of duty. If yes, the implications are truly frightening. Source: \"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Expanded-Americorps-has-an-authoritarian-feel-41889742.html\"",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism.

The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling.

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches.

Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly, while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion. Every legislator who either voted for this bill or didn\u2019t vote at all has some serious explaining to do.

The expanded Americorps is not quite so disturbing, but a number of provisions in the bill raise serious concerns. To begin with, the legislation threatens the voluntary nature of Americorps by calling for consideration of \u201ca workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people.\u201d It anticipates the possibility of requiring \u201call individuals in the United States\u201d to perform such service \u2013 including elementary school students.

It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling.

Yeah whatever. The only insults posted thus far refer to Herr Hannity and Herr Limburger (Is being called a German insulting, or simply racist?) The OP compares a proposed idea of this new administration with an old idea from Nazi Germany. It is a valid comparison. He does not personally liken a sitting President with one Adolph Hitler as you claim and as so many here have done, even during your \"tenure\" to President Bush and VP Cheney. And you fail to see the absolute hilarity in a situation where your idea is compared to a Nazi program and you lament the inability to declare such comparisons \"VERBOTEN\".",

The OP compares a proposed idea of this new administration with an old idea from Nazi Germany. It is a valid comparison. He does not personally liken a sitting President with one Adolph Hitler as you claim and as so many here have done, even during your \"tenure\" to President Bush and VP Cheney. And you fail to see the absolute hilarity in a situation where your idea is compared to a Nazi program and you lament the inability to declare such comparisons \"VERBOTEN\".",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling. Sounds like a government curriculum for government approved \u201cservice learning,\u201d which is nothing less than indoctrination. Now, ask yourself if congressmen who voted for this monstrosity had a clue what they were voting for. If not, they\u2019re guilty of dereliction of duty. If yes, the implications are truly frightening. Source: \"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Expanded-Americorps-has-an-authoritarian-feel-41889742.html\"",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

The bill also summons up unsettling memories of World War II-era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should \u201ccombine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service,\u201d while establishing \u201ccampuses\u201d that serve as \u201coperational headquarters,\u201d complete with \u201csuperintendents\u201d and \u201cuniforms\u201d for all participants. It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life. And it calls for creation of \u201ca permanent cadre\u201d in a \u201cNational Community Civilian Corps.\u201d But that\u2019s not all.

        "content": "What is the AmeriCorps Program? AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state.

Lurking behind the feel-good rhetoric spouted by the measure\u2019s advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism.

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",

The bill also calls for \u201cyouth engagement zones\u201d in which \u201cservice learning\u201d is \u201ca mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.\u201d This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be \u201cintegrated into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula\u201d at all levels of schooling. Sounds like a government curriculum for government approved \u201cservice learning,\u201d which is nothing less than indoctrination. Now, ask yourself if congressmen who voted for this monstrosity had a clue what they were voting for. If not, they\u2019re guilty of dereliction of duty. If yes, the implications are truly frightening. Source: \"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Expanded-Americorps-has-an-authoritarian-feel-41889742.html\"",

AmeriCorps is a national service program initiated by President Clinton, often referred to as the \u201cdomestic Peace Corps.\u201d AmeriCorps provides thousands of Americans of all ages and backgrounds with service scholarships in exchange for their service to their community. Nationally, over 350,000 AmeriCorps Members have helped to meet the nation\u2019s critical needs in the areas of public safety, education, human needs, and the environment. Hitler Youth/German Girls League. After 1939 membership was compulsory. On 25 March 1939 it was decreed that all members age 16 to 18 were to perform ANNUAL PUBLIC SERVICE. Boys were encouraged to work on the land at harvest time and girls were encouraged to help families with large numbers of children. The Landdeinst or Land Sevice was first instituted in 1934 and grew every year. Both boys and especially girls were encouraged and expected t volunteer for service on farms for a one year period. The one year service was marked on the BDM/Hitler Youth uniform with a black cuff title stating \"Landdienst HJ\". German Labour Service: The Reichsarbeitsdienst (or RAD, Reich Labour Service) was an institution set up in Nazi Germany as an instrument to combat unemployment, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the United States. During the Second World War it was an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht. The RAD was formed in July 1934 as the official state labour service. The RAD was an amalgamation of the many labour organisations formed in Germany during the times of the Weimar Republic[1]. RAD members were to provide service for various civic, military and agricultural construction projects. Konstantin Hierl was its leader all through the organization's lifetime. Organization RAD (House flag). The RAD symbol was popularly known as \"die Kaffeebohne\" (the coffee-bean) RAD (House flag, Female Sections)The RAD was divided into two major sections, the Reichsarbeitsdienst M\u00e4nner (RAD/M) for men and the Reichsarbeitdienst der weiblichen Jugend (RAD/wJ) for women. The RAD was set up into 40 districts each called an Arbeitsgau (lit. Divisional Work District). Each of these districts was headed by an officer with headquarters staff and a Wachkompanie (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight Arbeitsgruppen (Workers Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200-1800 men. These groups were finally divided into six company-sized RAD-Abteilung units. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a bicycle. The RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of a downward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great coats worn by all personnel. War The RAD was classed as Wehrmachtgefolge (lit. Armed Forces Auxiliaries). Auxiliary forces with this status while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection under the Geneva Convention. Some, including the RAD, were militarised. The National Socialist Motor Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps, NSKK), also known as the National Socialist Drivers Corps, was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that existed from 1931 to 1945. The group was a successor organization to the older National Socialist Automobile Corps, which had existed since the beginning of 1930. The primary aim of the NSKK was to educate its members in motoring skills. They were mainly trained in the operation and maintenance of high performance motorcycles and automobiles. In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, comparable to the modern-day American Automobile Association or the British Automobile Association. Membership in the NSKK did not require any knowledge of automobiles and the group was known to accept persons for membership without drivers' licenses. It was thought that training in the NSKK would make up for any previous lack of knowledge. The NSKK did, however, adhere to racial doctrine and screened its members for Aryan qualities. The NSKK was also a paramilitary organization with its own system of paramilitary ranks. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the National Socialist Motor Corps became a target of the Wehrmacht for recruitment, since NSKK members possessed knowledge of motorized transport, whereas the bulk of the Wehrmacht relied on horses. Most NSKK members thereafter joined the regular military, serving in the transport corps of the various service branches. German Labour Front (State Controlled Unions) The German Labour Front (German: Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) was the amalgamated National Socialist (Nazi) trade union organisation which replaced the free and diverse Weimar Republic trade unions that Adolf Hitler outlawed on 2 May 1933, after his rise to power. DAF's leader was Robert Ley, who stated its aim as 'to create a true social and productive community' (Smelster, 1988). Theoretically the DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. However, in reality it was a means by which workers were controlled, ensuring wage demands were not made too often.[citation needed] Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. Nevertheless, the employees were given relatively high set wages, security of work, dismissal was increasingly made difficult, social security programmes were started by the Arbeitsfront, leisure programmes were started, canteens, pauses and regular working times were established, and therefore generally the German workers were satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repaying for their absolute loyalty. Employment contracts created under the Weimar Republic were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism, liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the national socialist state. The DAF however did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies. DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 pfennig to 3 Reichsmark, depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. NPEA (Education) National Political Institutes of Education (German: Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten; officially abbreviated NPEA, commonly abbreviated Napola for Nationalpolitische Lehranstalt meaning National Political Institution of Teaching) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as \"community education sites\" after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933. The goal of the schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military, and administrative leadership of the Nazi state. The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded in the early 1930s during the years when a German Air Force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The organization was based closely on the organization of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes. When Nazi Germany formed the Luftwaffe, many NSFK members transferred. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members; this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the German military, who were composed of \"Old Guard\" officers from the German aristocracy. The National Socialist Flyers Corps continued to exist after the Luftwaffe was founded, but to a much smaller degree. During World War II, the NSFK mainly performed air defense duties such as reserve anti-aircraft service. OT (Labour-Civil Service) The Organisation Todt (OT) was a Third Reich civil and military engineering group in Germany eponymously named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior Nazi figure. The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in pre-World War II Germany, and in Germany itself and occupied territories from France to Russia during the war, and became notorious for using forced labor. The history of the organization falls fairly neatly into three phases: A pre-war period from 1933\u20131938 during which Todt\u2019s primary office was that of General Inspector of German Roadways (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen) and his primary responsibility the construction of the Autobahn network. The period from 1938, when the Organisation Todt proper was founded until February, 1942, when Todt died in a plane crash. During this period (1940) Fritz Todt was named Minister for Armaments and Munitions (Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the Organisation Todt became almost exclusively military. The period from 1942 until the end of the war, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the Organisation Todt was absorbed into the (renamed and expanded) Ministry for Armaments and War Production TeNo Technische Nothilfe (TeNo or TENO), lit: Technical Help in Need was a German organisation. It was set up as a technical unit of the paramilitary Freikorps \"Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division\". [edit] History TENO was founded on September 30, 1919 by Otto Lummitzsch to protect and maintain vital, strategic facilities (eg gas works, waterworks, power stations, the railways, post offices, agriculture concerns and food production facilities). At the time, these were under threat from sabotage and attack during a period bordering on civil war caused by the collapse of German society following the end of World War I and a spate of politically motivated wildcat strikes. The organisation emerged from army units into a volunteer civilian organisation brought about by the demilitarisation requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. Because of the nature of its operations, the background of its personnel was mainly conservative middle class including large number of students. In the Weimar Republic period, TENO was seen as a threat by the working class and aroused the animosity of trade unionists, and more particularly the KPD (German Communist Party). As economic conditions improved and strikes became less common and less aggressive, TENO shift its activities into areas such as disaster relief and air raid protection. From 1931, it began to be more involved in the Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst (Volunteer Labour Service) and was later controlled by the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Under the Third Reich TENO focussed on civil defence and air raid rescue and relief work. From 1936 TENO was gradually transformed into an auxiliary police function and came under the ultimate control of Heinrich Himmler. As well as within Germany, TENO was active in Nazi-occupied countries and local branch organisations were even formed in some countries (eg Norway and the Netherlands). In 1945 the victorious Allies dissolved TENO. Its functions were assumed again in 1950 when Lummitzsch formed THW (Technisches Hilfswerk, lit: Technical Relief) which exists to the present day (2005) with civil defence responsibilities. German Forestry Service Forest and Game administration, formerly under the control of of the Lander or individual German states, were united by the Nazis into the Office Of Forest Master. Before the war there 869,300 persons employed in the forestry woodworking industry. Veteran's Organiztions Usurped by the State of Nazi Germany. The Nationalsozialistische Kriegsopferversorgung (NSKOV), meaning \"National Socialist War Victim's Care\" was a social welfare organization for seriously wounded veterans as well as frontline fighters of World War I. The NSKOV was established in 1934 and was affiliated to the NSDAP.[1] After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as \"Law number five\", this Denazification decree disbanded the NSKOV, like all organizations linked to the Nazi Party. The organizations taking care of the welfare for World War I veterans had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. NS-RKB The Nationalsozialistisches Reichskriegerbund (NSRKB) was formed 4 March 1938. It became the only authorized war veterans' organization. It was regarded as the successor of the Deutscher Reichskriegerbund Kyffh\u00e4user (DRKB), for instance membership in the DRKB counted as membership in the NSRKB for purposes of longevity awards.",
