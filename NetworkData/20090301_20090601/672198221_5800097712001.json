        "content": "If you are getting shoddy goods at Wal-Mart you can blame Wal-Mart for this happening. In the beginning when a company wants to do business with Wal-Mart they offer their product at a price and with minor haggling Wal-Mart purchases thousands and thousands of units. In some cases they buy almost the entire output of the supplier. After a few years of this Wal-Mart starts lowering the amount they will pay and since the supplier has no one else to sell such volume to they lower the price. Each year the prices are negotiated lower and lower until the manufacturer simply is not making a profit. Here is where the product suffers. You can buy an item at Wal-Mart in the same box with the same numbers and it will be nothing but a cheap piece of junk or you can by the original product from another store at a reasonable price and get a good product. Wall-Mart knows this but yet continues these practices and continues to sell the junk. This is a great example of you get what you pay for! This message has been edited.
