The sights, sounds and tastes of 1940s-era Havana filled the air on the evening of Friday, June 6 for Family Centers\u2019 2008 benefit - Fiesta Cuba. The event was held at the Belle Haven home Laurie and Peter Grauer. Known to attract the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ava Gardner and Gary Cooper, Cuba was dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Playground\u201d during the years following World War II. Laurie Grauer, along with her fellow co-chairs Patti Fast, Julie Graham and Nonie Sullivan, combined a touch of that glitz and glamour with the laid-back feel the Caribbean is known for to create a true paradise under the stars. Before sitting down to an authentic Cuban feast, guests were treated to mojitos, other tropical drinks and hand-rolled cigars. Meanwhile, roulette, poker and other games of chance were played in the world-famous Riviera Casino. But the party really heated up once the sun went down, as a 13-piece orchestra played a mix of Latin and party tunes sure to keep the dance floor filled all night. The funds raised will benefit Family Centers\u2019 30 education and human service programs. It is not our belief or disbelief that can make or unmake the fact. ~ Thomas Paine",

Within hours, the idea spread to both houses of Congress, with lawmakers proposing an AIG bonus tax. The move represents somewhat of an about-face for the Senator.

That amendment provides an \u201cexception for contractually obligated bonuses agreed on before Feb. 11, 2009\u201d -- which exempts the very AIG bonuses Dodd and others are now seeking to tax. The amendment made it into the final version of the bill, and is law. Separately, Sen.

Within hours, the idea spread to both houses of Congress, with lawmakers proposing an AIG bonus tax.

That amendment provides an \u201cexception for contractually obligated bonuses agreed on before Feb. 11, 2009,\u201d which exempts the very AIG bonuses Dodd and others are seeking to tax. The amendment is in the final version and is law. Also, Sen.

Meanwhile, roulette, poker and other games of chance were played in the world-famous Riviera Casino.
