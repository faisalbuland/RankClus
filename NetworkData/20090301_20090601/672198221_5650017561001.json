Marines are great story tellers, no matter what their job is and this will only cultivate those skills. I am a former Marine, and served as a Combat Photographer for the 24th MEU in Kosovo, Djbouti, UAE, Kenya, and Iraq among other places. I am a disabled veteran now living outside of Boston. I recently went back to school for photography and it was a great experience. It is defintiely something that Marines would excel at - there are two others there now. Even though I was out, I needed that connection to the military and did my portfolio on Veterans. I just want to continue telling the story of them, now with more of an editorial/portraiture approach that focuses on the individual veterans that are now out. If anyone is interested, you can check out these images at www.jeffsistophotography.com. Let me know what you think. I would love to somehow get connected to this program, but don't know where to start. If anyone actually reads this please let me know if you have any ifo on it. Thanks and good luck to the Marines doing this.",
