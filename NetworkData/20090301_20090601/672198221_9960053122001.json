This is such BS. IMO the school went way beyond the reach of their ability. If they thought it was illegal drugs, that required a strip search, the police should have been called, plus the parents. Neither were called. And now the school is refusing to admit wrong doing on its part.",

What transpired was totally unacceptable and they should be behind bars for child molestation - and instead they still sit comfortably at their jobs - and they are using the excuse of \"it will impede their ability to keep drugs out of schools if the court rules against us\" to keep from winding up behind bars. The school officials should count their lucky stars that they are even alive because a lot of parents would have taken matters into their own hands by now.",

Americans are supposed to have protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Yes, those laws are supposed to keep police from overstepping against citizens, but... who the hell do those school officials think they are? What right to they have to tell a student to remove her clothes? And what ticks me off just as much... is this asinine restriction against students keeping the most basic medications in their bags. Why should a school nurse have to keep a student's medication in the office? It belongs to the student, not to the nurse. I don't feel that the nurse should have the right, on behalf of the school, to hold the students' medications, prescription or otherwise. For that matter, Advil can be purchased over-the-counter. There are no laws against it, no restrictions on how much a person can own. I just don't see what right the school officials had to do this to this girl, and why there's even a discussion over whether or not this should be allowed.",
