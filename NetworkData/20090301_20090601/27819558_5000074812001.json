Resident Joshua Weaver presented the resolution at the council's work session today, identifying himself as a gay man and saying homosexuals \"are not recognized as equal citizens in this city.\" The resolution states support for \"same-sex couples to share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities and commitments of civil marriage\" as heterosexuals. It would, though, have no effect on state law. City attorney Patrick Baker said he would review the resolution and present the council a recommendation April 9. \"From time to time we resolve to have the legislature change the laws. ... so that's what this would be,\" Baker said. Weaver said the resolution has already been endorsed by the towns of Chapel Hill and Carrboro. The News & Observer >http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/1449939.html",

Actually, there are some cities and towns that have co-habitation laws, by which any two adults living under one roof can register as co-habitants, and be covered by certain legal protections. This can be a pair of friends, an older single parent and his or her adult son or daughter, or even a heterosexual couple that doesn't want to get married, but wants some degree of legal protection as a household. I personally think it's a brilliant idea. Example: Our neighbors are a mother-daughter pair. Both are single, both are adults. The mother is a bit older, and they're maintaining the household together. Legally, the daughter is too old to be on the mother's insurance anymore, and the household is LEGALLY treated as if two unrelated adults were simply rooming together. I think it would be wonderful if they could register as a household unit together. Maybe the mother could even be on the daughter's health insurance, if the daughter has the better job. As far as a group is concerned... that's another issue. Pairs of adults can enter a legal contract differently than multiple-party contracts. But as far as a marriage is concerned, we're comparing \"two legal adults\" to \"two legal adults.\" Group contracts... that's an argument for another day.",
