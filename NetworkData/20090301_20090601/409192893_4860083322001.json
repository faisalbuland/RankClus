There is only so much money. They are already swiming in debt up to their eye balls. I think its $1.8 trillion this year alone. He has already commited to saving the banks. To saving the insurance industry. To proping up whatever gets propped up by his stimulus bill earlier this year. There simply is no more money. He has to prioritize and the auto manufacturers which make a product that hurts rather than helps global warming isn't a high priority for what little dollars he has. Besides. Don't you guys know that Detroit has been a long time supporter of Republican candidates?",
