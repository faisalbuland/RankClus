Barack Obama and Joe Biden believe both of these extremes are wrong, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve proposed a plan that strengthens employer coverage, makes insurance companies accountable and ensures patient choice of doctor and care without government interference. The Obama-Biden plan provides affordable, accessible health care for all Americans, builds on the existing health care system, and uses existing providers, doctors, and plans. Under the Obama-Biden plan, patients will be able to make health care decisions with their doctors, instead of being blocked by insurance company bureaucrats. Under the plan, if you like your current health insurance, nothing changes, except your costs will go down by as much as $2,500 per year. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you will have a choice of new, affordable health insurance options. Read more here: http://change.gov/agenda/health_care_agenda/",

Barack Obama and Joe Biden believe both of these extremes are wrong, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve proposed a plan that strengthens employer coverage, makes insurance companies accountable and ensures patient choice of doctor and care without government interference. The Obama-Biden plan provides affordable, accessible health care for all Americans, builds on the existing health care system, and uses existing providers, doctors, and plans. Under the Obama-Biden plan, patients will be able to make health care decisions with their doctors, instead of being blocked by insurance company bureaucrats. Under the plan, if you like your current health insurance, nothing changes, except your costs will go down by as much as $2,500 per year.

That's why there is a big push towards health care reform. Just as a matter of interest Phoenix how much was your insurance premium this year (if it's not a rude question)? $850 seems a lot of money for perhaps an hours work. I wonder how much it would have cost if you'd gone to your local vet and asked him/her to stitch you up, probably a lot less. You might not have got a local anaesthetic though. In my rugby playing days I was stitched up by both a doctor and a (equine) vet and have to say that the vet's handiwork was quicker, neater, left less of a scar and (being local free because I wanted to get back on the pitch) a lot less painful than the doctor's .",

Barack Obama and Joe Biden believe both of these extremes are wrong, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve proposed a plan that strengthens employer coverage, makes insurance companies accountable and ensures patient choice of doctor and care without government interference. The Obama-Biden plan provides affordable, accessible health care for all Americans, builds on the existing health care system, and uses existing providers, doctors, and plans. Under the Obama-Biden plan, patients will be able to make health care decisions with their doctors, instead of being blocked by insurance company bureaucrats. Under the plan, if you like your current health insurance, nothing changes, except your costs will go down by as much as $2,500 per year.

She feels better until the last day of antibiotics. Now she is worse than ever. He basically says he does not know what is wrong. 5 minutes of face time and 2 prescriptions later he gives up.
