Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise directed. Name of Product: Kidde XL Fire Extinguishers Units: About 167,000 Distributor: Walter Kidde Portable Equipmenty, Inc., of Mebane, N.N. Hazard: The pressurized cylinders in the recalled fire extinguishers could lose pressure and fail to operate. In the event of a fire, this failure could put a consumer and property at risk. Incidents/Injuries: None Reported Description: This recall involves the Kidde XL Fire extinguishers with model numbers: FX340SC, FX340H, FX340GW, XL5MR, FX210R, FX340SC-2, FX210W, XL2.5TCZ-4, E-340-3 and with the manufacturers dates between October 2007 and April 2008. \"Kidde\" and the model number can be found on the label on the front of the extinguisher. The manufacture year is on the bottom of the extinguisher. If your extinguisher is one of listed model numbers and is marked with the year '07' or '08'. Sold at: Department, home, and hardware stores nationwide from October 2007 through April 2008 for about $35. Manufacturered in: Mexico Remedy: Consumers should immediately inspect the pressure guage. If it points to the 'red zone', contact Kidde to receive a free replacement extinguisher. If the guage is not in the 'red zone', but you have questions about an extinguisher within the listed model numbers, please contact Kidde for additional information. Consumer Contact: For additional information, contact Kidde at (888)345-4407 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday or visit the firm's web site at \"www.Kidde.com\" +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I have dealt with these extinguishers before in the course of my line of work these past few years. They are junk! A couple of years before, Kidde issued a large recall of their 10# ABC fire extinguishers due to a factory defective failure connected to the cylinder neck welded to the cylinder. The weld was poor, and resulted in loss of pressure. This latest recall covers the 2.5 and 5 pound extinguishers. This pressure failure may be due to any of the following: Defective Guage, Defective O-Ring, Defective Check Stem. These extinguishers are normally found in the homes, as well as newly-opened businesses, when the contractor buys them 'in bulk', installs them so said business can qualify for their \"Certificate of Occupancy\". I DO NOT advise having these above in your home or garage. Contact me thru my profile if you have any questions. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Hoffy1951, Mon 23 March 2009 04:48 PM",
