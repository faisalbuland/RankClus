When the robber started forcing the clerks to tie each other up, they decided this was going to be a hostage situation or worse - - So they jumped the guy - took his gun - and SHOT him to death!!! YEH!! The guy should have heeded an age-old saying: Don't bring a gun to Gunnison, son!!! This message has been edited.
