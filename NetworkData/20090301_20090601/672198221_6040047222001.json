Manny Ramirez, who the Dodgers aquired from Boston last year, has been a big part of the team's resurgence back to the top of the NL West is gone for 50 games. He has decided not to appeal and start the suspension immediatly. Took a substance from a doctor with out clearing it with MLB medical first. From the article: quote: Ramirez, a baseball source told SI.com, explained to baseball officials he was uncertain he was taking a banned substance and may have had a medical reason for using the substance. After consultation with the Major League Baseball Players Association and his representatives, Ramirez has decided not to challenge the suspension, according to an MLBPA statement. The source said the substance was not classified as a steroid but was clearly defined as a banned performance enhancer according to the drug agreement between baseball and its players association. Banned substances can only be taken with prior knowledge and medical clearance from baseball's drug-program administrators. Such exceptions are known as Therapeutic Use Exemptions, or TUEs. The suspension is an indication Ramirez did not have a TUE for the substance.",

How that GM still has his job is beyond me, there must be some kind of \"fortress\" mentality in the Bronx, no \"outsiders\" allowed I guess... It doesn't matter if the yankees score 20 runs when they give up 25....The Yankees are going to go through some PAINFUL years ahead, their farm system is garbage... I'm not your typical Yankee hater, but they realy do suck on the field and in the front office... Either way, The Dodgers do not have the best record in baseball because of Manny. I really want to know what he tested positive for.",
