This \"If you do this it is torture but if you only do a moderated version it is not\" is pure and simply BS in my opinion. Yours may differ and I would like to hear it. Got a few things on my plate about this one. First is war an atrocity or is it a fine and noble endeavor that needs to be burnished and glorified? I say it's an atrocity and when you get down to it, it does seem kind of silly to have rules of atrocity. On the surface. Say we do away with the ROE. Everybody gets to do what they want. Bayonet babies, shoot women after we rape 'em, loot, pillage and torture to our hearts content. Since they do that to us anyway, why not? As long as our Nazis beat their Nazis, it's all good right? We all stood the watch but I want no part of that and I will not associate with anyone that does. And neither will you. So the ROE can be frustrating and stupid sometimes but it's basically saying what I just said and it is absolutely necessary. We can't let some sadistic losers on the other side dictate our morality.

My position is, that if it is legitimate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against non-Americans who are believed to be terrorists, than it is equally legitmate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against Americans who are believed to be criminals. Conversely, if it is not legitimate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against Americans who are believed to be criminals, than it is equally not legitmate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against non-Americans who are believed to be terrorists. Do you take the position that Timothy McVeigh should have been subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" prior to his execution for acts of terrorism? Such \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" might have revealed more of his co-conspirators - possibly an entire networks of Right-wing American anti-government terrorists. If it is legitimate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" on an Iraqi civilian who was turned in by his next-door neighbor for a cash reward and who may or may not have been a terrorist, why not use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" on an American (McVeigh) who was actually convicted in an American court of law of committing a terrorist act? It is not apples and oranges - it's apples and apples - it's the same and you cannot legitimately have it both ways. Preface: I served with Tim McVeigh, though we were in different companies. He was either B or C Co, 2/16, and I was D Co. But we were both stationed at Riley at the same time, and his barracks were right next to us. I no doubt saw the man standing in formation on more than one occasion. Freaky. I can't completely disagree, though I do believe you're trying to find a very narrow definition I simply don't share. One (McVeigh) is a criminal, protected under the Constitutional rights endowed unto all citizens of the USA. He is a protected class due to his nationality. The other (Joe Terrorist) is NOT a domestic threat, but a foreign one. Therefore, he cannot claim citizenship and, as such, is subject only to the laws of HIS nation or the Geneva Convention (which I still think is bunk - if his nation didn't sign the GC, they should get NO rights at all, ever). There was never anything even remotely suggesting that McVeigh was a head of a large group of millions hellbent on destroying America. We \"torture\" terrorists because they are already PROVEN to have information on an organization hellbent on destroying America. You're right: can't have your cake and eat it, too. Now tell that to the whiny terrorists that want protections from the nations they refused to join and be a productive part of, choosing instead to murder innocents in the name of God. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

But America was one of the first countries to sign the Geneva Convention. We are one of the first to hollar about ROE. Let me get this straight. You are trying to kill me and I am suppose to use rules to stop you and kill you in turn? As a warrior this does not make any sense to me. You try to kill me and I try to kill you using whatever means to achieve that goal. Isn't that the meaning of war? This \"If you do this it is torture but if you only do a moderated version it is not\" is pure and simply BS in my opinion. Yours may differ and I would like to hear it. As a warrior in a fight with an enemy that is trying to kill you, anything goes. Once that enemy becomes a prisoner, it\u2019s different. Not only are there laws established by civilized societies to protect prisoners, it is dishonorable for a warrior to torture a prisoner. Even just slapping or kicking someone whose hands are tied is a chicken **** thing to do. As for that personal level that you talked about \u2013 below is what I posted on another thread. Answer the question, if you can. There have been times when I have extracted a pound of flesh from someone who has done me wrong. I saw a guy reach up my girl friend\u2019s skirt one time. After knocking him on his ass, did I torture him? Damn sure did. I kicked and stomped on him until much damage was done. Was that the right or wrong thing to do? Certainly if there had not been a sympathetic crowd at the bar that night I could have gone to jail. It was illegal, but was it wrong? If a terrorist were holding my wife hostage, demanding money and the release of other terrorist would I, given the chance, torture his accomplice to try and get her released? Sure, because that is the natural reaction of a pizzed off, scared husband. If terrorists were holding my wife and others hostage, demanding money and the release of terrorist, should the government give into those demands? No, because the United States cannot negotiate with terrorists, no matter how much I would plead for my wife\u2019s life. Same hostage situation, two different reactions \u2013 one is a personal choice/reaction the other is a matter of policy/law. In all cases, the law must prevail. We are a nation of laws \u2013 common laws that have been established by civilized societies over the course of centuries. America was established on the principles of those laws. Americans have fought and died to uphold those principles and laws. One of those laws is that prisoners cannot be tortured. You present the question: \u201cAsk yourself not whether it is right or wrong, but is it necessary for the greater good.\u201d Here is my answer/question: Without laws, who are you willing to allow to decide what is right and wrong for the greater good? Dick Cheney? President Obama?",

Hell we have had news of juvenile prison guards torturing juvenile prisoners and have been convicted of doing so, as well as, torture within our jails and adult prison population. (links upon request) So with this information at our disposal and the Abu Graib debacle, why even claim not to torture? Oh, because we claim this morale superiority which is BS in my opinion. So why not just say that we will do whatever it takes to protect American lives instead of all this back and forth? I know dog-gone well if someone had one of my grandbabies and was a threat to them, if I had someone who knew where they were being held, there is nothing I would not do to make them tell me.

But America was one of the first countries to sign the Geneva Convention. We are one of the first to hollar about ROE. Let me get this straight. You are trying to kill me and I am suppose to use rules to stop you and kill you in turn? As a warrior this does not make any sense to me. You try to kill me and I try to kill you using whatever means to achieve that goal. Isn't that the meaning of war? This \"If you do this it is torture but if you only do a moderated version it is not\" is pure and simply BS in my opinion. Yours may differ and I would like to hear it. Got a few things on my plate about this one. First is war an atrocity or is it a fine and noble endeavor that needs to be burnished and glorified? I say it's an atrocity and when you get down to it, it does seem kind of silly to have rules of atrocity. On the surface. Say we do away with the ROE. Everybody gets to do what they want. Bayonet babies, shoot women after we rape 'em, loot, pillage and torture to our hearts content. Since they do that to us anyway, why not? As long as our Nazis beat their Nazis, it's all good right? We all stood the watch but I want no part of that and I will not associate with anyone that does. And neither will you. So the ROE can be frustrating and stupid sometimes but it's basically saying what I just said and it is absolutely necessary. We can't let some sadistic losers on the other side dictate our morality. As for torture, two thoughts on that. If I have you and your laptop with all that good encrypted intel and I need that password, you are going to give it to me because it is immediately verifiable and after that first lie you will know what's coming next so you will tell me, probably sooner than later. Those type of situations usually materialize downrange and that quick decision will be made by Pvts, Sgts, and junior grade officers and their decision, even if correct might land them in the hotseat. I've already stated my willingness to do a kneecap or two if it would save my people's lives but that's to a guy who was trying to kill me a few minutes ago. If I'm not really sure what you know then torture is probably going to quickly reach the point of diminishing returns. Yes I will get answers, any answer you think I want just to get me to stop. You will also sign anything I put in front of you so it will be great for getting a false confession. you will admit that you are Jack the Ripper and Mother Theresa. Since most interrogation specialists seem to regard torture as ineffective, I'll take my cue from them. Spoken like someone who has never sat down across from a detained indvidual..

Fact is: If I sit down across from anyone, ANYONE, given enough time, I'm going to get what i want. The thing is, that time...is paid for in blood. To sum up my views: I am against torture. I am for a massive expansion of our humint abilitys, both in terms of manpower and training. I am also for an expansion of of current regulations to provide for more effective techinues, given need and qualified, experienced oversight. I'm not an interrogator, are you? How many interrogations have you administered? I think if you have enough time and freedom to use any method you choose you will get what you get. You won't know what you have until you have time to verify it. Most of the good intel is obtained by other means than torture. The qualified and experienced oversight that you mentioned seems to agree.",

However, between 1998-2003 Iran SLAUGHTERED and TORTURED - 60-thousand of its OWN people to maintain control. No one seemed to mind - not much is ever said about it... To my knowledge the only ones we used enhanced techniques on were those considered to have vitil information. I think it is a mistake to give terrorists the privilege of the GC status because it ligitimizes their cause. It feeds another Palestinian issue.",

But I don't think waterboarding is torture, despite what a bunch of UN Staff Weenies say about it. It has nothing to do with American versus non-American or even God. But it especially has nothing to do with the combination of the two. It is about securing our protection from those that fly planes into buildings in order to kill no one but innocents in a declaration of war. It is about bringing to justice those responsible for these murders, preventing future murders, and solidifying suspected intelligence information to expose our potential weaknesses.

Once again -- hear me closely, bro -- I DO NOT condone torture. Not in any means or shape or form. I simply disagree that the discomfort and fear of waterboarding can truly be deemed as torture. I disagree, It is apples AND apples, not apples and oranges. Civilian, American criminals both \"disrupt socio-flow and harmony\" AND threaten the \"sovereignty of the social environment\". If you prefer, let's call waterboarding \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" rather than \"torture\". My position is, that if it is legitimate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against non-Americans who are believed to be terrorists, than it is equally legitmate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against Americans who are believed to be criminals. Conversely, if it is not legitimate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against Americans who are believed to be criminals, than it is equally not legitmate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against non-Americans who are believed to be terrorists. Do you take the position that Timothy McVeigh should have been subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" prior to his execution for acts of terrorism? Such \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" might have revealed more of his co-conspirators - possibly an entire networks of Right-wing American anti-government terrorists. If it is legitimate and correct to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" on an Iraqi civilian who was turned in by his next-door neighbor for a cash reward and who may or may not have been a terrorist, why not use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" on an American (McVeigh) who was actually convicted in an American court of law of committing a terrorist act? It is not apples and oranges - it's apples and apples - it's the same and you cannot legitimately have it both ways.",

It is not apples and oranges - it's apples and apples - it's the same and you cannot legitimately have it both ways. Preface: I served with Tim McVeigh, though we were in different companies.

I no doubt saw the man standing in formation on more than one occasion. Freaky. I can't completely disagree, though I do believe you're trying to find a very narrow definition I simply don't share. One (McVeigh) is a criminal, protected under the Constitutional rights endowed unto all citizens of the USA. He is a protected class due to his nationality. The other (Joe Terrorist) is NOT a domestic threat, but a foreign one. Therefore, he cannot claim citizenship and, as such, is subject only to the laws of HIS nation or the Geneva Convention (which I still think is bunk - if his nation didn't sign the GC, they should get NO rights at all, ever). There was never anything even remotely suggesting that McVeigh was a head of a large group of millions hellbent on destroying America.

Now tell that to the whiny terrorists that want protections from the nations they refused to join and be a productive part of, choosing instead to murder innocents in the name of God.
