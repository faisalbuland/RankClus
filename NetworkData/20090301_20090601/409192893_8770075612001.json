A national postcard campaign is flooding the White House and congressional offices with messages opposing FOCA, and Catholic bishops have made defeating the abortion rights legislation a top priority. In the most recent effort to stop the bill, Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia sent a letter to every member of Congress imploring them to \"please oppose FOCA.\" There is only one hitch. Congress isn't about to pass the Freedom of Choice Act \u2014 because no such bill has been introduced in the current Congress. At a time when the United States is gripped by economic uncertainty and faces serious challenges in hot spots around the globe, some American Catholics are finding it both curious and troubling that their church has launched a major campaign against a piece of legislation that doesn't exist and wouldn't have much chance of becoming law even if it did. To many critics, it feels like the legislative equivalent of the dog that didn't bark. The campaign against FOCA, which would essentially codify the Roe v. Wade decision by saying the government can't place limits on abortions performed before viability, began shortly after Barack Obama's election in November, at the annual general meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). In a unanimous decision, the bishops voted to \"mobilize the resources of the USCCB, dioceses and the entire Catholic community\" to oppose the act. A chain e-mail of unknown origin soon began making its way into Catholic inboxes, warning of an imminent threat to the anti-abortion cause. \"For those of you who do not know,\" it read, \"the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) is set to be signed if Congress passes it on January 21-22 of 2009. The FOCA is the next sick chapter in the book of abortion.\" The e-mail urged Catholics to say a novena \u2014 a devotion of dedicated prayer for nine successive days \u2014 beginning on Jan. 11 and ending the day prior to Inauguration Day. When Jan. 22 came and went without a Freedom of Choice Act becoming law, the USCCB's Committee on Pro-Life Activities announced a nationwide postcard campaign to blanket congressional offices and the White House with appeals to stop FOCA. Anti-FOCA groups on Facebook soon had more than 150,000 members and added thousands more each day. Priests started preaching against the legislation, and churches began circulating petitions to oppose its passage. In the midst of all this activity, the fact that there was no Freedom of Choice Act before the 111th Congress went largely unnoticed and unmentioned... James Salt, director of organizing for the progressive organization Catholics United, thinks the USCCB has been prodded into focusing on FOCA by misinformation from conservative groups. \"These right-wing organizations are deliberatively misleading people in order to stoke the culture war,\" says Salt. \"They're using this as a fundraising tool, as a way to gin up their relevancy. And unfortunately, some of these groups have the ear of certain bishops.\"... While the USCCB's literature about FOCA has been generally accurate, the chain e-mail has disseminated a number of false claims, including warnings that the proposal would force Catholic hospitals to shut down and lead to at least 100,000 more abortions each year. Some versions of the e-mail even claimed that FOCA could \"result in a future amendment that would force women by law to have abortions in certain situations \u2014 and even regulate how many children women are allowed to have.\" In response, Catholic News Service \u2014 the official news agency affiliated with the USCCB \u2014 ran an article that began, \"Internet rumors to the contrary, no Catholic hospital in the United States is in danger of closing because of the Freedom of Choice Act.\" Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of the Catholic Health Association, told the news agency that the legislation \"has never contained anything that would force Catholic hospitals or Catholic personnel to do abortions or to participate in them.\" How like the frequent claims that \"The Obama Adminstration wants to re-institute the Fairness Doctrine\" (also not based on any real facts). How many of you Pro-Life readers have been taken in by these lies and have contacted your Senators and representatives to oppose a proposed law or law that doesn't even exist? Do you feel just a little bit foolish?",

He was a German pastor who supported Adolf Hitler because they were both anti-communists. Then Hitler took another step and not only wanted total separation of Church and State but that the State was supreme and Niemoller protested. Niemoller organized other clergymen to protest the laws proposed by Nazis and their 'blame' of various groups for the economic and social woes of Germany. Others gave in to the Nazis' threats. Hitler arrested Niemoller and confined him in the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps. Niemoller was released in 1945 by the Allies. His poem is well-known, frequently quoted, and is a popular model for describing the dangers of political apathy, as it often begins with specific and targeted fear and hatred which soon escalates out of control. \"When the Nazis came for the communists, I remained silent; I was not a communist. When they locked up the social democrats, I remained silent; I was not a social democrat. When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out; I was not a trade unionist. When they came for the Jews, I remained silent; I was not a Jew. When they came for me, there was no one left to speak out.\" Hitler claimed to be a Christian and was also a great orator making promises to each group of Germans on how he would make life better and 'fairer'! Our 'Great Depression' was mild compared to what was taking place in Germany and throughout Europe at the same time. He first eroded then destroyed German rights similar to those we call our \"Bill of Rights\" - Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Religion; Right to bear arms; unwarranted Search and Seizure; etc. Contrary to popular belief, slavery was a minor factor of the causes of our Civil War. Economically, both the Industrialized North and more rural South relied on 'cheap' labor. The North because of its manufacturing and urban centers could rely on the population to provide that work force. Wages were so low, households were barely able to survive but the 'American Dream' of advancement was there and as most were from the European 'serfdom' heritage; it was better than what they were used to. The Rural south also needed a nearby work force for the larger 'plantations' and cheap labor - Slavery. The second major factor was the difference between State rights and Federal control. Again do to diparity of the population in size and economic status, the Southern States were largly ignored in receiving benefit of a Federal Government or even much voice in its operation. Similar to today with the smaller States getting a few crumbs and having little influence over the Federal System or their own resources. Lincoln inherited the 'Civil War' from James Buchanan; Seven States had already seceded and Lincoln was not even on the ballot in the 'Slave States'. Hopfully our clearer heads will prevail today but only if we listen, watch and protest! ... and this means that we have to make our voices heard before our Government Officials propose or enact legislation or policy not after the fact.",

Economically, both the Industrialized North and more rural South relied on 'cheap' labor. The North because of its manufacturing and urban centers could rely on the population to provide that work force. Wages were so low, households were barely able to survive but the 'American Dream' of advancement was there and as most were from the European 'serfdom' heritage; it was better than what they were used to. The Rural south also needed a nearby work force for the larger 'plantations' and cheap labor - Slavery. The second major factor was the difference between State rights and Federal control. Again do to diparity of the population in size and economic status, the Southern States were largly ignored in receiving benefit of a Federal Government or even much voice in its operation. Similar to today with the smaller States getting a few crumbs and having little influence over the Federal System or their own resources. Lincoln inherited the 'Civil War' from James Buchanan; Seven States had already seceded and Lincoln was not even on the ballot in the 'Slave States'. Hopfully our clearer heads will prevail today but only if we listen, watch and protest! ... and this means that we have to make our voices heard before our Government Officials propose or enact legislation or policy not after the fact.",

You're comparing the implications of this bill to the restrictions on human rights perpetrated by the Nazi regime. A disgusting comparison, at best. You also seem to be comparing Hitler to Obama. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but if you are... as an American of Jewish ancestry, I say that you've just stepped WAY over the line. Besides, in terms of restricting rights, were you this vocal about defending your freedoms that were trampled by the Patriot Act?

As for people's religious freedom - it is a wonderful thing that all people in the United States are supposed to have religious freedom. However, that right is also meant to ensure that the religious beliefs of one group are not imposed on another group. Example: You believe that it is evil to wear the color orange. You have the right to not wear orange. You can not stop someone else from wearing orange. You claim youy religion prohibits abortion. Having read the Bible more than once, I've not seen any passage that equates abortion with murder, but hey, believe whatever you want. You have the right to never participate in an abortion if you believe it's evil. However, imposing your religious beliefs on someone else restricts their freedoms, and the \"fine line\" between infanticide and abortion of a non-viable fetus isn't really such a fine line from a medical stance. But I can agree with one thing you said: You can't pigeonhole extremism. I think we can recognize real extremism when we see it, and can pretty much agree it's bad news. How about your read this passage from the book of Jeremiah 1:5 - Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart;, which is to say that life does begin in the womb, therefore making abortion a killing of a human life.",

In Biblical times, a pregnancy was considered to have \"life\" in it when the mother experienced the \"quickening.\" That's typically late 2nd trimester or early 3rd trimester, when the fetus starts to develop the neurological functions of a baby.

A national postcard campaign is flooding the White House and congressional offices with messages opposing FOCA, and Catholic bishops have made defeating the abortion rights legislation a top priority. In the most recent effort to stop the bill, Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia sent a letter to every member of Congress imploring them to \"please oppose FOCA.\" There is only one hitch. Congress isn't about to pass the Freedom of Choice Act \u2014 because no such bill has been introduced in the current Congress. At a time when the United States is gripped by economic uncertainty and faces serious challenges in hot spots around the globe, some American Catholics are finding it both curious and troubling that their church has launched a major campaign against a piece of legislation that doesn't exist and wouldn't have much chance of becoming law even if it did. To many critics, it feels like the legislative equivalent of the dog that didn't bark. The campaign against FOCA, which would essentially codify the Roe v. Wade decision by saying the government can't place limits on abortions performed before viability, began shortly after Barack Obama's election in November, at the annual general meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). In a unanimous decision, the bishops voted to \"mobilize the resources of the USCCB, dioceses and the entire Catholic community\" to oppose the act. A chain e-mail of unknown origin soon began making its way into Catholic inboxes, warning of an imminent threat to the anti-abortion cause. \"For those of you who do not know,\" it read, \"the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) is set to be signed if Congress passes it on January 21-22 of 2009. The FOCA is the next sick chapter in the book of abortion.\" The e-mail urged Catholics to say a novena \u2014 a devotion of dedicated prayer for nine successive days \u2014 beginning on Jan. 11 and ending the day prior to Inauguration Day. When Jan. 22 came and went without a Freedom of Choice Act becoming law, the USCCB's Committee on Pro-Life Activities announced a nationwide postcard campaign to blanket congressional offices and the White House with appeals to stop FOCA. Anti-FOCA groups on Facebook soon had more than 150,000 members and added thousands more each day. Priests started preaching against the legislation, and churches began circulating petitions to oppose its passage. In the midst of all this activity, the fact that there was no Freedom of Choice Act before the 111th Congress went largely unnoticed and unmentioned... James Salt, director of organizing for the progressive organization Catholics United, thinks the USCCB has been prodded into focusing on FOCA by misinformation from conservative groups. \"These right-wing organizations are deliberatively misleading people in order to stoke the culture war,\" says Salt. \"They're using this as a fundraising tool, as a way to gin up their relevancy. And unfortunately, some of these groups have the ear of certain bishops.\"... While the USCCB's literature about FOCA has been generally accurate, the chain e-mail has disseminated a number of false claims, including warnings that the proposal would force Catholic hospitals to shut down and lead to at least 100,000 more abortions each year. Some versions of the e-mail even claimed that FOCA could \"result in a future amendment that would force women by law to have abortions in certain situations \u2014 and even regulate how many children women are allowed to have.\" In response, Catholic News Service \u2014 the official news agency affiliated with the USCCB \u2014 ran an article that began, \"Internet rumors to the contrary, no Catholic hospital in the United States is in danger of closing because of the Freedom of Choice Act.\" Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of the Catholic Health Association, told the news agency that the legislation \"has never contained anything that would force Catholic hospitals or Catholic personnel to do abortions or to participate in them.\" How like the frequent claims that \"The Obama Adminstration wants to re-institute the Fairness Doctrine\" (also not based on any real facts). How many of you Pro-Life readers have been taken in by these lies and have contacted your Senators and representatives to oppose a proposed law or law that doesn't even exist? Do you feel just a little bit foolish?",

Some versions of the e-mail even claimed that FOCA could \"result in a future amendment that would force women by law to have abortions in certain situations \u2014 and even regulate how many children women are allowed to have.\" In response, Catholic News Service \u2014 the official news agency affiliated with the USCCB \u2014 ran an article that began, \"Internet rumors to the contrary, no Catholic hospital in the United States is in danger of closing because of the Freedom of Choice Act.\" Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of the Catholic Health Association, told the news agency that the legislation \"has never contained anything that would force Catholic hospitals or Catholic personnel to do abortions or to participate in them.\"",

Niemoller organized other clergymen to protest the laws proposed by Nazis and their 'blame' of various groups for the economic and social woes of Germany. Others gave in to the Nazis' threats. Hitler arrested Niemoller and confined him in the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps. Niemoller was released in 1945 by the Allies. His poem is well-known, frequently quoted, and is a popular model for describing the dangers of political apathy, as it often begins with specific and targeted fear and hatred which soon escalates out of control. \"When the Nazis came for the communists, I remained silent; I was not a communist. When they locked up the social democrats, I remained silent; I was not a social democrat. When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out; I was not a trade unionist.

The -UPCOMING- Freedom Of Choice Act (FOCA) is all about instituting a law to force Catholic (and other Religious) Hospitals and/or Pro-Life Medical Personnel to adhere to the LIBERAL Pro-Choice agenda of FOCA.",

That passage refers to God's specific intent to create a Prophet, a particularly special individual, which is what is meant by the phrase \"set you apart.\" It refers to the soul of that person. If this passage indicates life before birth, then it also indicates LIFE BEFORE CONCEPTION. It says \"Before I formed you in the womb,\" which would mean before conception. And in this passage, it refers to the SOUL, not the physical life. It refers to God's foreknowledge of the future, that God knows the future, and the planned creation of a special prophet, not that someone is alive before birth or before conception.

In Biblical times, a pregnancy was considered to have \"life\" in it when the mother experienced the \"quickening.\" That's typically late 2nd trimester or early 3rd trimester, when the fetus starts to develop the neurological functions of a baby.

A national postcard campaign is flooding the White House and congressional offices with messages opposing FOCA, and Catholic bishops have made defeating the abortion rights legislation a top priority. In the most recent effort to stop the bill, Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia sent a letter to every member of Congress imploring them to \"please oppose FOCA.\" There is only one hitch. Congress isn't about to pass the Freedom of Choice Act \u2014 because no such bill has been introduced in the current Congress. At a time when the United States is gripped by economic uncertainty and faces serious challenges in hot spots around the globe, some American Catholics are finding it both curious and troubling that their church has launched a major campaign against a piece of legislation that doesn't exist and wouldn't have much chance of becoming law even if it did. To many critics, it feels like the legislative equivalent of the dog that didn't bark. The campaign against FOCA, which would essentially codify the Roe v. Wade decision by saying the government can't place limits on abortions performed before viability, began shortly after Barack Obama's election in November, at the annual general meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). In a unanimous decision, the bishops voted to \"mobilize the resources of the USCCB, dioceses and the entire Catholic community\" to oppose the act. A chain e-mail of unknown origin soon began making its way into Catholic inboxes, warning of an imminent threat to the anti-abortion cause. \"For those of you who do not know,\" it read, \"the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) is set to be signed if Congress passes it on January 21-22 of 2009. The FOCA is the next sick chapter in the book of abortion.\" The e-mail urged Catholics to say a novena \u2014 a devotion of dedicated prayer for nine successive days \u2014 beginning on Jan. 11 and ending the day prior to Inauguration Day. When Jan. 22 came and went without a Freedom of Choice Act becoming law, the USCCB's Committee on Pro-Life Activities announced a nationwide postcard campaign to blanket congressional offices and the White House with appeals to stop FOCA. Anti-FOCA groups on Facebook soon had more than 150,000 members and added thousands more each day. Priests started preaching against the legislation, and churches began circulating petitions to oppose its passage. In the midst of all this activity, the fact that there was no Freedom of Choice Act before the 111th Congress went largely unnoticed and unmentioned... James Salt, director of organizing for the progressive organization Catholics United, thinks the USCCB has been prodded into focusing on FOCA by misinformation from conservative groups. \"These right-wing organizations are deliberatively misleading people in order to stoke the culture war,\" says Salt. \"They're using this as a fundraising tool, as a way to gin up their relevancy. And unfortunately, some of these groups have the ear of certain bishops.\"... While the USCCB's literature about FOCA has been generally accurate, the chain e-mail has disseminated a number of false claims, including warnings that the proposal would force Catholic hospitals to shut down and lead to at least 100,000 more abortions each year. Some versions of the e-mail even claimed that FOCA could \"result in a future amendment that would force women by law to have abortions in certain situations \u2014 and even regulate how many children women are allowed to have.\" In response, Catholic News Service \u2014 the official news agency affiliated with the USCCB \u2014 ran an article that began, \"Internet rumors to the contrary, no Catholic hospital in the United States is in danger of closing because of the Freedom of Choice Act.\" Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of the Catholic Health Association, told the news agency that the legislation \"has never contained anything that would force Catholic hospitals or Catholic personnel to do abortions or to participate in them.\" How like the frequent claims that \"The Obama Adminstration wants to re-institute the Fairness Doctrine\" (also not based on any real facts).

He was a German pastor who supported Adolf Hitler because they were both anti-communists. Then Hitler took another step and not only wanted total separation of Church and State but that the State was supreme and Niemoller protested. Niemoller organized other clergymen to protest the laws proposed by Nazis and their 'blame' of various groups for the economic and social woes of Germany. Others gave in to the Nazis' threats. Hitler arrested Niemoller and confined him in the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps. Niemoller was released in 1945 by the Allies. His poem is well-known, frequently quoted, and is a popular model for describing the dangers of political apathy, as it often begins with specific and targeted fear and hatred which soon escalates out of control. \"When the Nazis came for the communists, I remained silent; I was not a communist. When they locked up the social democrats, I remained silent; I was not a social democrat. When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out; I was not a trade unionist. When they came for the Jews, I remained silent; I was not a Jew. When they came for me, there was no one left to speak out.\" Hitler claimed to be a Christian and was also a great orator making promises to each group of Germans on how he would make life better and 'fairer'! Our 'Great Depression' was mild compared to what was taking place in Germany and throughout Europe at the same time. He first eroded then destroyed German rights similar to those we call our \"Bill of Rights\" - Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Religion; Right to bear arms; unwarranted Search and Seizure; etc. Contrary to popular belief, slavery was a minor factor of the causes of our Civil War. Economically, both the Industrialized North and more rural South relied on 'cheap' labor. The North because of its manufacturing and urban centers could rely on the population to provide that work force. Wages were so low, households were barely able to survive but the 'American Dream' of advancement was there and as most were from the European 'serfdom' heritage; it was better than what they were used to. The Rural south also needed a nearby work force for the larger 'plantations' and cheap labor - Slavery. The second major factor was the difference between State rights and Federal control. Again do to diparity of the population in size and economic status, the Southern States were largly ignored in receiving benefit of a Federal Government or even much voice in its operation. Similar to today with the smaller States getting a few crumbs and having little influence over the Federal System or their own resources. Lincoln inherited the 'Civil War' from James Buchanan; Seven States had already seceded and Lincoln was not even on the ballot in the 'Slave States'. Hopfully our clearer heads will prevail today but only if we listen, watch and protest! ... and this means that we have to make our voices heard before our Government Officials propose or enact legislation or policy not after the fact.",

We're talking about religion and the soul and an eternal, infinite, incorporeal Deity, and you want to say that life is limited to the physical? The Bible verse does not say \"you were alive in the womb.\" It says that God knew Jeremiah BEFORE he was conceived. That is clearly speaking of the \"essence\" or the \"soul\" of the prophet, or God's knowledge of the future prophet-to-be. In Biblical times, a pregnancy was considered to have \"life\" in it when the mother experienced the \"quickening.\" That's typically late 2nd trimester or early 3rd trimester, when the fetus starts to develop the neurological functions of a baby. So, other than the passage from the first chapter of Jeremiah, which clearly indicates the consecration of a prophet BEFORE he was \"formed in the womb,\" what Bible passages speak of the personhood status of a fetus?",

A national postcard campaign is flooding the White House and congressional offices with messages opposing FOCA, and Catholic bishops have made defeating the abortion rights legislation a top priority. In the most recent effort to stop the bill, Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia sent a letter to every member of Congress imploring them to \"please oppose FOCA.\" There is only one hitch. Congress isn't about to pass the Freedom of Choice Act \u2014 because no such bill has been introduced in the current Congress. At a time when the United States is gripped by economic uncertainty and faces serious challenges in hot spots around the globe, some American Catholics are finding it both curious and troubling that their church has launched a major campaign against a piece of legislation that doesn't exist and wouldn't have much chance of becoming law even if it did. To many critics, it feels like the legislative equivalent of the dog that didn't bark. The campaign against FOCA, which would essentially codify the Roe v. Wade decision by saying the government can't place limits on abortions performed before viability, began shortly after Barack Obama's election in November, at the annual general meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). In a unanimous decision, the bishops voted to \"mobilize the resources of the USCCB, dioceses and the entire Catholic community\" to oppose the act. A chain e-mail of unknown origin soon began making its way into Catholic inboxes, warning of an imminent threat to the anti-abortion cause. \"For those of you who do not know,\" it read, \"the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) is set to be signed if Congress passes it on January 21-22 of 2009. The FOCA is the next sick chapter in the book of abortion.\" The e-mail urged Catholics to say a novena \u2014 a devotion of dedicated prayer for nine successive days \u2014 beginning on Jan. 11 and ending the day prior to Inauguration Day. When Jan. 22 came and went without a Freedom of Choice Act becoming law, the USCCB's Committee on Pro-Life Activities announced a nationwide postcard campaign to blanket congressional offices and the White House with appeals to stop FOCA. Anti-FOCA groups on Facebook soon had more than 150,000 members and added thousands more each day. Priests started preaching against the legislation, and churches began circulating petitions to oppose its passage. In the midst of all this activity, the fact that there was no Freedom of Choice Act before the 111th Congress went largely unnoticed and unmentioned... James Salt, director of organizing for the progressive organization Catholics United, thinks the USCCB has been prodded into focusing on FOCA by misinformation from conservative groups. \"These right-wing organizations are deliberatively misleading people in order to stoke the culture war,\" says Salt. \"They're using this as a fundraising tool, as a way to gin up their relevancy. And unfortunately, some of these groups have the ear of certain bishops.\"... While the USCCB's literature about FOCA has been generally accurate, the chain e-mail has disseminated a number of false claims, including warnings that the proposal would force Catholic hospitals to shut down and lead to at least 100,000 more abortions each year. Some versions of the e-mail even claimed that FOCA could \"result in a future amendment that would force women by law to have abortions in certain situations \u2014 and even regulate how many children women are allowed to have.\" In response, Catholic News Service \u2014 the official news agency affiliated with the USCCB \u2014 ran an article that began, \"Internet rumors to the contrary, no Catholic hospital in the United States is in danger of closing because of the Freedom of Choice Act.\" Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of the Catholic Health Association, told the news agency that the legislation \"has never contained anything that would force Catholic hospitals or Catholic personnel to do abortions or to participate in them.\" How like the frequent claims that \"The Obama Adminstration wants to re-institute the Fairness Doctrine\" (also not based on any real facts). How many of you Pro-Life readers have been taken in by these lies and have contacted your Senators and representatives to oppose a proposed law or law that doesn't even exist?

While the bill has not been formally introduced in this Congress, it was in the last Congress (as well as in 1989 and 1993) ... and was co-sponsored by POTUS 44. Since NARAL has been and is trumpeting this legislation and since it seems likely that it will be reintroduced in the current Congress, it seems perfectly reasonable to me to oppose that which NARAL is lobbying for extensively. If NARAL and their ilk back away from their support for the bill, perhaps the Catholic Church will not see the need for a vocal opposition. Silly and superficial thread ... fabricated and slanted issue ... even if (or perhaps because) it originated with Time. That the bill has not been introduced yet in this Congress does not make it mythical ... it is very real.",

He was a German pastor who supported Adolf Hitler because they were both anti-communists. Then Hitler took another step and not only wanted total separation of Church and State but that the State was supreme and Niemoller protested. Niemoller organized other clergymen to protest the laws proposed by Nazis and their 'blame' of various groups for the economic and social woes of Germany. Others gave in to the Nazis' threats. Hitler arrested Niemoller and confined him in the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps. Niemoller was released in 1945 by the Allies. His poem is well-known, frequently quoted, and is a popular model for describing the dangers of political apathy, as it often begins with specific and targeted fear and hatred which soon escalates out of control. \"When the Nazis came for the communists, I remained silent; I was not a communist. When they locked up the social democrats, I remained silent; I was not a social democrat. When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out; I was not a trade unionist. When they came for the Jews, I remained silent; I was not a Jew. When they came for me, there was no one left to speak out.\" Hitler claimed to be a Christian and was also a great orator making promises to each group of Germans on how he would make life better and 'fairer'! Our 'Great Depression' was mild compared to what was taking place in Germany and throughout Europe at the same time. He first eroded then destroyed German rights similar to those we call our \"Bill of Rights\" - Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Religion; Right to bear arms; unwarranted Search and Seizure; etc. Contrary to popular belief, slavery was a minor factor of the causes of our Civil War. Economically, both the Industrialized North and more rural South relied on 'cheap' labor. The North because of its manufacturing and urban centers could rely on the population to provide that work force. Wages were so low, households were barely able to survive but the 'American Dream' of advancement was there and as most were from the European 'serfdom' heritage; it was better than what they were used to. The Rural south also needed a nearby work force for the larger 'plantations' and cheap labor - Slavery. The second major factor was the difference between State rights and Federal control. Again do to diparity of the population in size and economic status, the Southern States were largly ignored in receiving benefit of a Federal Government or even much voice in its operation. Similar to today with the smaller States getting a few crumbs and having little influence over the Federal System or their own resources. Lincoln inherited the 'Civil War' from James Buchanan; Seven States had already seceded and Lincoln was not even on the ballot in the 'Slave States'. Hopfully our clearer heads will prevail today but only if we listen, watch and protest! ... and this means that we have to make our voices heard before our Government Officials propose or enact legislation or policy not after the fact.",

Then I would highly suggest that you DO read it, and try to internalize the extent of the risk to our REAL Constitutional Rights and Civil Liberties it actually posed, and the times when it actually DID impose on the Constitutional Rights of American citizens who were not in any way affiliated with terrorists. We had members of the press being arrested, harassed, and blocked, all under the carte blanche of the Patriot Act. These stories were conveniently ignored (read: hushed up) in the mainstream media. As for people's religious freedom - it is a wonderful thing that all people in the United States are supposed to have religious freedom. However, that right is also meant to ensure that the religious beliefs of one group are not imposed on another group. Example: You believe that it is evil to wear the color orange. You have the right to not wear orange. You can not stop someone else from wearing orange. You claim youy religion prohibits abortion. Having read the Bible more than once, I've not seen any passage that equates abortion with murder, but hey, believe whatever you want. You have the right to never participate in an abortion if you believe it's evil. However, imposing your religious beliefs on someone else restricts their freedoms, and the \"fine line\" between infanticide and abortion of a non-viable fetus isn't really such a fine line from a medical stance. But I can agree with one thing you said: You can't pigeonhole extremism. I think we can recognize real extremism when we see it, and can pretty much agree it's bad news.",

The Air Force Research Laboratory's materials and manufacturing directorate is testing aluminum oxynitride -- ALONtm -- as a replacement for the traditional multi-layered glass transparencies now used in existing ground and air armored vehicles.

The Air Force Research Laboratory's materials and manufacturing directorate is testing aluminum oxynitride -- ALONtm -- as a replacement for the traditional multi-layered glass transparencies now used in existing ground and air armored vehicles. The test is being done in conjunction with the Army Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Md., and University of Dayton Research Institute, Ohio.
