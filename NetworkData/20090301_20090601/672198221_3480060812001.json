Just another example here. Obama received support from fellow Democrats, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. \"This is another outrageous example of executives -- including those whose decisions were responsible for the problems that caused AIG's collapse -- enriching themselves at the expense of taxpayers,\" the Democrat from Connecticut said. He noted in a written statement that executives at other companies that received bailout funds have volunteered to forgo bonuses. \"There's no reason why those at AIG shouldn't do the same,\" he said. Later, Dodd told CNN he is considering an unusual approach to get the bonus money back. \"One idea we're kind of thinking about is a tax provision,\" the Connecticut Democrat said. \"We have a right to tax. You could write a tax provision that's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses. That's a way maybe to deal with it.\" Dodd said the notion is in the \"earliest of thinking\" and has not been settled on as a way to resolve the issue that has set off outrage in Washington and across the country. OK all you hard workers who may get your Christmas bonuses or you salesman who do a good job busting your butts out there. Remember if your bonuses get taxed this year it ain't Bush's fault.",
