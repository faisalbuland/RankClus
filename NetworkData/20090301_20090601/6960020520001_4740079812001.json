If, we serve honorably, do our best and occasionaly become MOH level heros, we can still stand with the rest of the past's citizen warriors with pride. The MOH award may well pass into history, along with the Purple heart, our most ancient award. It too is being denigrated, down played and awarded capriciously. My thoughts on this subject tend to wander, as the article dealt alot with the process, and obstacles to actually awarding the MOH. Heroic events tend to be immediate, forgotten quickly and lost in the paper process. It is far easier to absorb a 15 second blurb on MSM devoted to gaining our span of attention, than to deal with the abstract logistics of awarding a Medal, of what ever stripe. Finally, the folks that were saved, rescued or given new life, by a MOH Hero know the circumstances and hopefully will pass the story on. end",
