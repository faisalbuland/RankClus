The list, found in his home, included a metals plant that had forced Michael McLendon to resign years ago. Also on the list was a sausage factory where he suddenly quit last week and a poultry plant that suspended his mother, District Attorney Gary McAliley said. McAliley was quoted as telling The Dothan Eagle that McLendon also listed people at the sausage factory who had complained about McLendon for such things as not wearing earplugs and slicing the meat too thin. \"We found a list of people he worked with, people who had done him wrong,\" the district attorney said outside the charred house where the rampage began. But investigators offered no immediate explanation for why he targeted relatives and other people who weren't on the list as he fired more than 200 rounds in a roughly 20-mile trail of carnage across two counties near the Florida state line Tuesday.",

Fairy tale of the 2nd Amendment????....The intent of the Founding Fathers is supposed to be the basis of the Constitution. In virtually every letter written by our Founders about firearms was pro gun. In fact, to be a patriotic american, they considered a firearm in the home mandatory. To protect your property, family, and community. The first thing the British did was to head for the guns and powder. The first thing every bloody dictator did was disarm the people. Our founders knew full well what happens to a disarmed people. Almost every state constitution writer had the same feelings. Most everywhere a conceal carry permit is law, crime is down. Australia spent 500 million dollars taking guns from the law abiding people. The murder rate is skyrocketing. As is almost every other type crime. It seems the criminals take particular delight in going after people they know are unarmed, and shy away from those who may have a firearm. Even criminals will tell you that. That's not what I'm talking about. Some people seem to think that gun control means that the government is secretly planning to take everybody's gun and that it's basically illegal. I have never seen a plot to disarm the people but there are too many wild guns on the street and they are too easy for lawless elements to get. The situation for someone who lives out in Wyoming or somewhere fairly remote is a lot different than for the people of a more urban area. You are correct that things are different out in the boonies as opposed to the cities. However, the gov't won't stop at the city lines. The goverment hasn't secretly tried to take anyone's guns, they've openly tried to do it with lawsuits against the manufacturers, and banning ammo. Most of the cop killer bullets were common hunting bullets. You are also right about guns on the strret. They will always be there. Only the law abiding will be disarmed, as Australia is finding out now. Only their law makers are still baffled at the rising murder rate. You can't fix stupid!",

Also it is the age of tattoos, drugs, porn, and Muslims wanting to take over the world. Two people are to blame for this world problem. Bush and God.",

You are correct that things are different out in the boonies as opposed to the cities. However, the gov't won't stop at the city lines.

Most of the cop killer bullets were common hunting bullets. You are also right about guns on the strret. They will always be there. Only the law abiding will be disarmed, as Australia is finding out now. Only their law makers are still baffled at the rising murder rate. You can't fix stupid!",

Even if you made guns completely illegal for any American to own, the criminal element would still be able to get them just as easily as they do now. Most guns used in crimes are acquired by illegal means and that is something that gun control laws cannot control.
