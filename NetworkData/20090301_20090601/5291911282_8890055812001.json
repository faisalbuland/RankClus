        "content": "//tossinghandgrenades.wordpress.com/2008/05/16/army-ng-trucks-defaced/ I took these pictures at Camp Shelby, MS. They are vehicles of the Pennsylvania National Guards vehicles that were vandalized while on the rails en route to Mississippi. These soldiers are performing training before deploying to Iraq. For me I believe this is an absolute shame to have this done and I know that there will not be any mention of these wronged soldiers in the MSM. These soldiers deserve our support, what you think of the situation does not matter. These soldiers are serving; they are doing what they are supposed to do. They are doing things and living a life that most Americans cannot even imagine. If you hate Bush, go after him, but I've noticed the bombs, bullets and missiles are still flying under the President we have now. If you hate DC, go after DC, but never place such weight on the shoulders of these soldiers, they carry enough. These soldiers are us. They are the same people we are. They are the same people you went to school with. What is even sadder it is these same vandals, that when they are in need, will be calling on these same soldiers to come save them when the time comes. Pathetic *******s that these vandals are. I am so angered at the stupidity, cowardice, and probably blind following of some rabid liberal anti-military ideology behind such acts. I am also sure that there are many such acts that never get any attention whatsoever. I bet if this was done to a mosque there would be no end to the cries of hate crimes and how bad we Americans are and more self loathing. But this gets done to our soldiers, not a peep. If this had been done to anything related to Muslims CAIR would be filing lawsuits and the MSM would be calling America nothing but a land of Racist, cause ya know, EVERYTHING is about racism. (Sarcasm) (Take note, one picture has anti-Semitic remark.) Well, here is my shout of rage against these pigs; here is my loathing of spineless Americans that would bow before our enemies while hiding behind our soldiers. Here is my battle cry against the Machine of Cowardice that is killing our country for the sake of being nice to the people that want to kill us all. To all the people that support the enemy, at least have the courage to go fight with them. Meet the same fate they do, instead of just buying spray paint. Otherwise to me, all Americans, and probably the people you demented sheep believe in, you are nothing but cowards and take an easy path where you only have to have enough courage to buy paint and never actually make any kind of real stand. Weak weak weak. Support the troops, put shame on such cowardly acts, and stop the brainwashing.",

For me I believe this is an absolute shame to have this done and I know that there will not be any mention of these wronged soldiers in the MSM. These soldiers deserve our support, what you think of the situation does not matter. These soldiers are serving; they are doing what they are supposed to do. They are doing things and living a life that most Americans cannot even imagine. If you hate Bush, go after him, but I've noticed the bombs, bullets and missiles are still flying under the President we have now. If you hate DC, go after DC, but never place such weight on the shoulders of these soldiers, they carry enough. These soldiers are us. They are the same people we are. They are the same people you went to school with. What is even sadder it is these same vandals, that when they are in need, will be calling on these same soldiers to come save them when the time comes. Pathetic *******s that these vandals are. I am so angered at the stupidity, cowardice, and probably blind following of some rabid liberal anti-military ideology behind such acts. I am also sure that there are many such acts that never get any attention whatsoever. I bet if this was done to a mosque there would be no end to the cries of hate crimes and how bad we Americans are and more self loathing. But this gets done to our soldiers, not a peep. If this had been done to anything related to Muslims CAIR would be filing lawsuits and the MSM would be calling America nothing but a land of Racist, cause ya know, EVERYTHING is about racism. (Sarcasm) (Take note, one picture has anti-Semitic remark.) Well, here is my shout of rage against these pigs; here is my loathing of spineless Americans that would bow before our enemies while hiding behind our soldiers. Here is my battle cry against the Machine of Cowardice that is killing our country for the sake of being nice to the people that want to kill us all. To all the people that support the enemy, at least have the courage to go fight with them. Meet the same fate they do, instead of just buying spray paint. Otherwise to me, all Americans, and probably the people you demented sheep believe in, you are nothing but cowards and take an easy path where you only have to have enough courage to buy paint and never actually make any kind of real stand.

The \"displays\", as the greedy, liberal, and clearly UN-AMERICAN lawyers and other busybodies disparagingly refer to, are; clean, neat, often NEW flagpoles, standards and guidons designed specifically and solely for such 'displays' of flags. Apparently, it is just ultra-unacceptable to display ANY kind of 'support' or manifestion of a political viewpoint in a HOA, especially 'pro-troop' or 'pro-mission'. What a bunch of Commie crap, huh? A red banner with a yellow hammer-and-sickle logo in the middle would likely be unanimously approved by said nefarious and ever-meddlesome HOA boards. They NEVER 'get it'!!
