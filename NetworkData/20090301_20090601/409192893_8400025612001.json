Hip-hop is a sub-culture that transcends all racial, cultural and national bounds.

Why am I not surprised? this aint about hip hop but gangster rap.... and gangster is very racist... Gangsta rap was the mid 90's style of hip hop, just like the hair bands were the 80's style of rock. Gangsta rap isn't even part of the rap vocabulary anymore. You obviously know nothing of hip hop. yea and they talk about killing whitie and how whitie is the devil and must die ect.... that isnt racist?? but screwdriver is??? look up the band screwdriver thats a white power band and their lyrics are about the same as gangster rap bands but about other then whites....",
