We would either consider it a threat to our well bing or just devalue it as lesser than us. Unless of course we found it a benefit to us. Maybe we could enslave it. Maybe we could engage in trade. Maybe we would benefit from an aliance that would help ensure the survival of mankind. But most likely because of our collective ignorance we would just kill it if it was easy to do so. Yes looking back on our history our repeated ignornce in our actions has proven me right. Even if science confirms it as being alive and proves it's value there will be those among us that would not rely on their moral conscience as a guide and would find some \"secular reason\" to kill it.

        "content": "Both Legion and Bruce triggered an eyebrow raise here. For the sake of balancing a clearly tipped scale, let me provide a few points of clarity: 1. In Legion's opening post, he begins with identifying the benefits of scientific progression regardless of religious/non-religious beliefs, but then goes on to attempt redefining a secularist as those who embrace science without moral balance. Watch where you're swinging that broad brush when you make such ridiculous statements. It is offensive to imply that secularists have no morality; that morality is a concept reserved solely for those swinging a holy book. 2. Life takes on many forms... Sometimes it is the unborn fetus within the womb. Other times, it's a mass of cancerous cells. It's a very specific component of what we call \"living\" that Legion failed to identify. Specifically, consciousness (or a soul, whichever you prefer) is what distinguishes one form of life from the other. But who has the right to determine which form gets to live and the other gets \"aborted\". Doesn't the cancer have a right to live? Or is it the fact that cancer isn't human (despite the near-identical genetic makeup) that dooms it to abortion? To be fair, I agree with at least part of Legion's distaste of abortion. It is shameful that some resort to abortion as a means of birth control. I refuse to see tax dollars spent for an abortion because he or she didn't want to be inconvenienced with wearing a condom or some other more responsible form of birth control. Then there is the portion of the dilemma that has opposing sides presenting the abortion issue as the unhindered right to get an abortion versus an outright ban of any abortions. Whether you like it or not, Legion, the most outspoken pro-lifer activists are lobbying to have abortions outlawed completely. You may have a more balanced solution in mind, but it is not what they are fighting to implement. 3. With regards to Bruce's vague reference to Roe v Wade, I'm not suggesting that he hasn't read the material but the supreme court specifically commented that they were not legalizing abortion; that they were only recognizing the right to privacy... Consequently, the Privacy Act was passed the following year. If I wasn't so sleep-deprived, I'd provide a link to the decision briefs. 4. AK already provided the point I was going to use regarding living as a burden or undignified last years... This is a strong point that undeniably goes against typical Western culture; however, despite it's seemingly dispassionate approach, it is still the most dignified recourse for those who recognize the worth of a dignified existence even in the end. Of course, I don't have kids to burden.",

But who has the right to determine which form gets to live and the other gets \"aborted\". Doesn't the cancer have a right to live? Or is it the fact that cancer isn't human (despite the near-identical genetic makeup) that dooms it to abortion? To be fair, I agree with at least part of Legion's distaste of abortion. It is shameful that some resort to abortion as a means of birth control. I refuse to see tax dollars spent for an abortion because he or she didn't want to be inconvenienced with wearing a condom or some other more responsible form of birth control. Then there is the portion of the dilemma that has opposing sides presenting the abortion issue as the unhindered right to get an abortion versus an outright ban of any abortions. Whether you like it or not, Legion, the most outspoken pro-lifer activists are lobbying to have abortions outlawed completely. You may have a more balanced solution in mind, but it is not what they are fighting to implement. 3. With regards to Bruce's vague reference to Roe v Wade, I'm not suggesting that he hasn't read the material but the supreme court specifically commented that they were not legalizing abortion; that they were only recognizing the right to privacy... Consequently, the Privacy Act was passed the following year. If I wasn't so sleep-deprived, I'd provide a link to the decision briefs. 4. AK already provided the point I was going to use regarding living as a burden or undignified last years... This is a strong point that undeniably goes against typical Western culture; however, despite it's seemingly dispassionate approach, it is still the most dignified recourse for those who recognize the worth of a dignified existence even in the end.

For the sake of balancing a clearly tipped scale, let me provide a few points of clarity: 1. In Legion's opening post, he begins with identifying the benefits of scientific progression regardless of religious/non-religious beliefs, but then goes on to attempt redefining a secularist as those who embrace science without moral balance. Watch where you're swinging that broad brush when you make such ridiculous statements. It is offensive to imply that secularists have no morality; that morality is a concept reserved solely for those swinging a holy book. 2. Life takes on many forms... Sometimes it is the unborn fetus within the womb. Other times, it's a mass of cancerous cells. It's a very specific component of what we call \"living\" that Legion failed to identify.

Of course, I don't have kids to burden. Well Sabow, my sabot was meant to raise a few eyebrows. A shot above the brow as it were, a wake up call I appreciate your seemingly well thought out response. Answering your #1 above: A complete reading in context would show where I clarified with this sentence--> \"I believe every man has a conscience but those who spend little time in their growth process of forming a mature moral conscience are limited in their understanding of the implications of the very science they hold as truth.\" Answering your #2 above: Anyone that can with a clear conscience diminish the sanctity of the life of a human being inside the womb of his mother to that of a cancerous cell has fallen victim to this unbalanced \"secular reasoning\". I find it shameful. Man has done the same thing with the slaves and the Jewish and anyone else they wish to manipulate as \"less than human\". With all the science now available that shows the life structure of a baby depending on his mother to nurture him as he grows toward his independence, the eyes, nose, fingers, toes brain function...a human being at his most fragile state, there has to be some sort of deficiency of conscience that could not at least give this baby the benefit of the doubt if secular reasoning allows the doubt due as to any other human. Answering your #4 above: Although euthanasia is similar in reguard to life and death of a human being the life of the baby is not being decided by it's true owner; that being the baby itself. And the baby is not suffering as is the adult human being. The baby will require many more years of nurturing from his mother outside the womb until reaching maturity. But, can't you see how the reason abortion and euthanasia are grouped together in discussions is proof that we are consciously speaking of the life of a human being in both? Discussions on euthanasia recognizes this as fact but then later might say \"oh wait, we need to rethink how we approach this subject\". This is what I mean to show how secular reasoning disreguards the truth of conscience over their political whims. Being educated in science and politics should not disreguard or override their conscience when making their judgements especially in reguards to a human life whether inside or out of the womb. Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned. You seem well balanced. I just appeal to you to take into consideration that you just might be misguided by all the liberal hype on this most important subject of preserving the life of the innocent inside the womb. Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. - LegionSon -",

It is a foregone conclusion that there are times that force us to make difficult decisions, like choosing your wife over your child. There are medical conditions that can result in the death of the mother if she gives birth. So if she is using contraceptives and still becomes pregnant, do we condemn her to death to satisfy our mature moral conscience? quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: With all the science now available that shows the life structure of a baby depending on his mother to nurture him as he grows toward his independence, the eyes, nose, fingers, toes brain function...a human being at his most fragile state, there has to be some sort of deficiency of conscience that could not at least give this baby the benefit of the doubt if secular reasoning allows the doubt due as to any other human. There just has to be? Just because you can't see any other explanation does not validate the only one you can come up with. This attempt to validate your explanation is called an Argument from Ignorance, a common logical fallacy. If you truly can not see any other explanation, this only speaks to your inability to see the problem from all sides. This is not an attack. It is just me applying your logic in an attempt to help you understand the direction your thinking is taking you. quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: Answering your #4 above: Although euthanasia is similar in reguard to life and death of a human being the life of the baby is not being decided by it's true owner; that being the baby itself. And the baby is not suffering as is the adult human being. The baby will require many more years of nurturing from his mother outside the womb until reaching maturity. But, can't you see how the reason abortion and euthanasia are grouped together in discussions is proof that we are consciously speaking of the life of a human being in both? Discussions on euthanasia recognizes this as fact but then later might say \"oh wait, we need to rethink how we approach this subject\". This is what I mean to show how secular reasoning disreguards the truth of conscience over their political whims. Being educated in science and politics should not disreguard or override their conscience when making their judgements especially in reguards to a human life whether inside or out of the womb. It is not appropriate to compare euthanasia with abortion. While they both involve the taking of a life as a result of the perceived diminsihed quality of life, it is whose quality of life that differs. I have already stated my pro-choice stance but I also believe that abortion is not a form of birth control. The impact, both economical and psychological, is far more reaching than people would like to admit and it ultimately hits all of us. quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned. You seem well balanced. I just appeal to you to take into consideration that you just might be misguided by all the liberal hype on this most important subject of preserving the life of the innocent inside the womb. Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. Legion, I am as misguided by liberal hype as I am by conservative extremism. I find the inherent lack of balance in either view to be an unacceptable approach to addressing any issue. I review all sides before I take a stand. Your particular view of secularists being \"without conscience\" is misguided and a clear demonstration of a skewed viewpoint. More consistent with the definition would be to claim that it is the differing value sets with which you find conflict. It is the value set applied to a conscience that creates the conflict we are exposed to. In reality, nobody is without conscience. So at the root core of your thought process is the idea that we should all be like LegionSon. hmm...well, I stand by what I have stated. It is your own failing to read anything in addition to that of which I stated. Instead of admitting where you might be in error you express falsely that of which \"you say\" I imply....hehh, unreal. I will repeat one final time for you.---> \"I believe every man has a conscience but those who spend little time in their growth process of forming a mature moral conscience are limited in their understanding of the implications of the very science they hold as truth.\" Also--->\"the neglect of their moral conscience that many good men have discarded as they try to seperate science from God for those who believe or the use of science without morality or conscience for those who don't.\"<--- showing again where I believe that both believers and non-believers fail to follow their conscience. We all share in this responsibility. So then, the above should clearly show your statement to be false in requards to what you think I have implied. Another thing that should be abundantly clear is the value that I place on the human life inside the womb in contrast to yours. Lastly, in reguards to your distasteful last little jab in mistakenly knowing my \"root core\" of my thought process, as if that were even remotely possible, I will answer that I can only lead you to the water. - in clear conscience - - LegionSon -",

We would either consider it a threat to our well bing or just devalue it as lesser than us. Unless of course we found it a benefit to us. Maybe we could enslave it. Maybe we could engage in trade. Maybe we would benefit from an aliance that would help ensure the survival of mankind. But most likely because of our collective ignorance we would just kill it if it was easy to do so. Yes looking back on our history our repeated ignornce in our actions has proven me right. Even if science confirms it as being alive and proves it's value there will be those among us that would not rely on their moral conscience as a guide and would find some \"secular reason\" to kill it.

Of course, I don't have kids to burden. Well Sabow, my sabot was meant to raise a few eyebrows. A shot above the brow as it were, a wake up call I appreciate your seemingly well thought out response. Answering your #1 above: A complete reading in context would show where I clarified with this sentence--> \"I believe every man has a conscience but those who spend little time in their growth process of forming a mature moral conscience are limited in their understanding of the implications of the very science they hold as truth.\" Answering your #2 above: Anyone that can with a clear conscience diminish the sanctity of the life of a human being inside the womb of his mother to that of a cancerous cell has fallen victim to this unbalanced \"secular reasoning\". I find it shameful. Man has done the same thing with the slaves and the Jewish and anyone else they wish to manipulate as \"less than human\". With all the science now available that shows the life structure of a baby depending on his mother to nurture him as he grows toward his independence, the eyes, nose, fingers, toes brain function...a human being at his most fragile state, there has to be some sort of deficiency of conscience that could not at least give this baby the benefit of the doubt if secular reasoning allows the doubt due as to any other human. Answering your #4 above: Although euthanasia is similar in reguard to life and death of a human being the life of the baby is not being decided by it's true owner; that being the baby itself. And the baby is not suffering as is the adult human being. The baby will require many more years of nurturing from his mother outside the womb until reaching maturity. But, can't you see how the reason abortion and euthanasia are grouped together in discussions is proof that we are consciously speaking of the life of a human being in both? Discussions on euthanasia recognizes this as fact but then later might say \"oh wait, we need to rethink how we approach this subject\". This is what I mean to show how secular reasoning disreguards the truth of conscience over their political whims. Being educated in science and politics should not disreguard or override their conscience when making their judgements especially in reguards to a human life whether inside or out of the womb. Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned. You seem well balanced. I just appeal to you to take into consideration that you just might be misguided by all the liberal hype on this most important subject of preserving the life of the innocent inside the womb. Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. - LegionSon -",

It is not appropriate to compare euthanasia with abortion. While they both involve the taking of a life as a result of the perceived diminsihed quality of life, it is whose quality of life that differs. I have already stated my pro-choice stance but I also believe that abortion is not a form of birth control. The impact, both economical and psychological, is far more reaching than people would like to admit and it ultimately hits all of us. quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned.

Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. Legion, I am as misguided by liberal hype as I am by conservative extremism. I find the inherent lack of balance in either view to be an unacceptable approach to addressing any issue. I review all sides before I take a stand. Your particular view of secularists being \"without conscience\" is misguided and a clear demonstration of a skewed viewpoint. More consistent with the definition would be to claim that it is the differing value sets with which you find conflict. It is the value set applied to a conscience that creates the conflict we are exposed to. In reality, nobody is without conscience. So at the root core of your thought process is the idea that we should all be like LegionSon. This message has been edited. Last edited by: sabow, Thu 30 April 2009 07:14 AM",

Being educated in science and politics should not disreguard or override their conscience when making their judgements especially in reguards to a human life whether inside or out of the womb. It is not appropriate to compare euthanasia with abortion. While they both involve the taking of a life as a result of the perceived diminsihed quality of life, it is whose quality of life that differs. I have already stated my pro-choice stance but I also believe that abortion is not a form of birth control. The impact, both economical and psychological, is far more reaching than people would like to admit and it ultimately hits all of us. quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned.

I just appeal to you to take into consideration that you just might be misguided by all the liberal hype on this most important subject of preserving the life of the innocent inside the womb. Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. Legion, I am as misguided by liberal hype as I am by conservative extremism. I find the inherent lack of balance in either view to be an unacceptable approach to addressing any issue. I review all sides before I take a stand. Your particular view of secularists being \"without conscience\" is misguided and a clear demonstration of a skewed viewpoint. More consistent with the definition would be to claim that it is the differing value sets with which you find conflict. It is the value set applied to a conscience that creates the conflict we are exposed to. In reality, nobody is without conscience. So at the root core of your thought process is the idea that we should all be like LegionSon. This message has been edited. Last edited by: sabow, Thu 30 April 2009 07:14 AM",

There just has to be? Just because you can't see any other explanation does not validate the only one you can come up with.

        "content": "Both Legion and Bruce triggered an eyebrow raise here. For the sake of balancing a clearly tipped scale, let me provide a few points of clarity: 1. In Legion's opening post, he begins with identifying the benefits of scientific progression regardless of religious/non-religious beliefs, but then goes on to attempt redefining a secularist as those who embrace science without moral balance. Watch where you're swinging that broad brush when you make such ridiculous statements. It is offensive to imply that secularists have no morality; that morality is a concept reserved solely for those swinging a holy book. 2. Life takes on many forms... Sometimes it is the unborn fetus within the womb. Other times, it's a mass of cancerous cells. It's a very specific component of what we call \"living\" that Legion failed to identify. Specifically, consciousness (or a soul, whichever you prefer) is what distinguishes one form of life from the other. But who has the right to determine which form gets to live and the other gets \"aborted\". Doesn't the cancer have a right to live? Or is it the fact that cancer isn't human (despite the near-identical genetic makeup) that dooms it to abortion? To be fair, I agree with at least part of Legion's distaste of abortion. It is shameful that some resort to abortion as a means of birth control. I refuse to see tax dollars spent for an abortion because he or she didn't want to be inconvenienced with wearing a condom or some other more responsible form of birth control. Then there is the portion of the dilemma that has opposing sides presenting the abortion issue as the unhindered right to get an abortion versus an outright ban of any abortions. Whether you like it or not, Legion, the most outspoken pro-lifer activists are lobbying to have abortions outlawed completely. You may have a more balanced solution in mind, but it is not what they are fighting to implement. 3. With regards to Bruce's vague reference to Roe v Wade, I'm not suggesting that he hasn't read the material but the supreme court specifically commented that they were not legalizing abortion; that they were only recognizing the right to privacy... Consequently, the Privacy Act was passed the following year. If I wasn't so sleep-deprived, I'd provide a link to the decision briefs. 4. AK already provided the point I was going to use regarding living as a burden or undignified last years... This is a strong point that undeniably goes against typical Western culture; however, despite it's seemingly dispassionate approach, it is still the most dignified recourse for those who recognize the worth of a dignified existence even in the end. Of course, I don't have kids to burden.",

Of course, I don't have kids to burden. Well Sabow, my sabot was meant to raise a few eyebrows. A shot above the brow as it were, a wake up call I appreciate your seemingly well thought out response. Answering your #1 above: A complete reading in context would show where I clarified with this sentence--> \"I believe every man has a conscience but those who spend little time in their growth process of forming a mature moral conscience are limited in their understanding of the implications of the very science they hold as truth.\" Answering your #2 above: Anyone that can with a clear conscience diminish the sanctity of the life of a human being inside the womb of his mother to that of a cancerous cell has fallen victim to this unbalanced \"secular reasoning\". I find it shameful. Man has done the same thing with the slaves and the Jewish and anyone else they wish to manipulate as \"less than human\". With all the science now available that shows the life structure of a baby depending on his mother to nurture him as he grows toward his independence, the eyes, nose, fingers, toes brain function...a human being at his most fragile state, there has to be some sort of deficiency of conscience that could not at least give this baby the benefit of the doubt if secular reasoning allows the doubt due as to any other human. Answering your #4 above: Although euthanasia is similar in reguard to life and death of a human being the life of the baby is not being decided by it's true owner; that being the baby itself. And the baby is not suffering as is the adult human being. The baby will require many more years of nurturing from his mother outside the womb until reaching maturity. But, can't you see how the reason abortion and euthanasia are grouped together in discussions is proof that we are consciously speaking of the life of a human being in both? Discussions on euthanasia recognizes this as fact but then later might say \"oh wait, we need to rethink how we approach this subject\". This is what I mean to show how secular reasoning disreguards the truth of conscience over their political whims. Being educated in science and politics should not disreguard or override their conscience when making their judgements especially in reguards to a human life whether inside or out of the womb. Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned. You seem well balanced. I just appeal to you to take into consideration that you just might be misguided by all the liberal hype on this most important subject of preserving the life of the innocent inside the womb. Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. - LegionSon -",

You enforce this implication not only in the 3rd and subsequent sentences in your opening post, but also in other threads of similar topic. quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: Answering your #2 above: Anyone that can with a clear conscience diminish the sanctity of the life of a human being inside the womb of his mother to that of a cancerous cell has fallen victim to this unbalanced \"secular reasoning\".

Again, you put more effort into \"misunderstanding\" what I wrote than seeing what was really there. My comparison was not meant to diminish the viability of a human fetus. It was to show that there are scenarios that often force us to make difficult decisions. It is a foregone conclusion that there are times that force us to make difficult decisions, like choosing your wife over your child. There are medical conditions that can result in the death of the mother if she gives birth. So if she is using contraceptives and still becomes pregnant, do we condemn her to death to satisfy our mature moral conscience? quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: With all the science now available that shows the life structure of a baby depending on his mother to nurture him as he grows toward his independence, the eyes, nose, fingers, toes brain function...a human being at his most fragile state, there has to be some sort of deficiency of conscience that could not at least give this baby the benefit of the doubt if secular reasoning allows the doubt due as to any other human. There just has to be? Just because you can't see any other explanation does not validate the only one you can come up with. This attempt to validate your explanation is called an Argument from Ignorance, a common logical fallacy. If you truly can not see any other explanation, this only speaks to your inability to see the problem from all sides. This is not an attack. It is just me applying your logic in an attempt to help you understand the direction your thinking is taking you. quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: Answering your #4 above: Although euthanasia is similar in reguard to life and death of a human being the life of the baby is not being decided by it's true owner; that being the baby itself.

It is not appropriate to compare euthanasia with abortion. While they both involve the taking of a life as a result of the perceived diminsihed quality of life, it is whose quality of life that differs. I have already stated my pro-choice stance but I also believe that abortion is not a form of birth control. The impact, both economical and psychological, is far more reaching than people would like to admit and it ultimately hits all of us. quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned.

Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. Legion, I am as misguided by liberal hype as I am by conservative extremism. I find the inherent lack of balance in either view to be an unacceptable approach to addressing any issue. I review all sides before I take a stand. Your particular view of secularists being \"without conscience\" is misguided and a clear demonstration of a skewed viewpoint. More consistent with the definition would be to claim that it is the differing value sets with which you find conflict. It is the value set applied to a conscience that creates the conflict we are exposed to. In reality, nobody is without conscience.

This is what I mean to show how secular reasoning disreguards the truth of conscience over their political whims. Being educated in science and politics should not disreguard or override their conscience when making their judgements especially in reguards to a human life whether inside or out of the womb. It is not appropriate to compare euthanasia with abortion. While they both involve the taking of a life as a result of the perceived diminsihed quality of life, it is whose quality of life that differs.

You really should give credit to the author. Well bill, it was I and I AM. What you see is the original draft I composed as I typed it here and as you see it written. It was Spirit driven. The time spent compiling from my reasoning was approximately 5 minutes. I am guided by a moral conscience of many years of continued growth. This guidance would only be a witness of any co-author. But as I have said before \"God is the Author of all Science\" and \"Conscience is The Science Of God\". Some people thrive on scientific fact but ignore their moral conscience when applying it. So then bill, you can stop wasting time in your search for a copy elsewhere. Why not just take into consideration the neglect of their moral conscience that many good men have discarded as they try to seperate science from God for those who believe or the use of science without morality or conscience for those who don't.

        "quote": "Originally posted by billbright: quote: Originally posted by LegionSon: The benefits of science have proven to to be beneficial to all of mankind. No matter what religion or lack thereof man has been progressing since the beginning of time from it's discoveries. Men who understand both science and their moral conscience are the ones who hold the wisdom to safely and correctly apply it's measure. These men carefuly weigh the benefits along with the negatives before engaging in anything that could harm man in other ways than just the pure science. This is the way in which man has made use of the responsible and complete reasoning process available to man. Then on the other side of the scale we have \"secular reasoning\". Limited to just the science without a moral conscience being given its value is where we find ourselves today. Life inside the womb is a scientific fact. If we were to view this life on another planet we would have made history. \"Secular reasoning\" is a good tool when sticking to the facts in search of truth amongst those who follow. But what is hypocritical in their findings is their desire to ignore this fact of life inside the womb for political reasons. There is a far left movement of radical thinkers that have not the humility to understand morality. So when a secular humanist continues to argue the merits of truth by scientific fact only over a moral conscience remind them of the importance of the complete reasoning practice that you use to conclude your findings that life inside the womb is a life worthy of it's unalienable rights. To disreguard the science that reinforces this finding could be reguarded as going against these truths we hold self evident. I believe every man has a conscience but those who spend little time in their growth process of forming a mature moral conscience are limited in their understanding of the implications of the very science they hold as truth. If you agree with the importance of preserving life inside the womb please write your Senators and Congressmen. And maybe even the President will become educated. You can send them a copy of this if you like. Tell them of the importance of \"The Conscience Clause\" to continue. - LegionSon - LS, I was trying to find where you copied and pasted this from.

        "reply": " Well bill, it was I and I AM. What you see is the original draft I composed as I typed it here and as you see it written. It was Spirit driven. The time spent compiling from my reasoning was approximately 5 minutes. I am guided by a moral conscience of many years of continued growth. This guidance would only be a witness of any co-author. But as I have said before \"God is the Author of all Science\" and \"Conscience is The Science Of God\". Some people thrive on scientific fact but ignore their moral conscience when applying it. So then bill, you can stop wasting time in your search for a copy elsewhere. Why not just take into consideration the neglect of their moral conscience that many good men have discarded as they try to seperate science from God for those who believe or the use of science without morality or conscience for those who don't.

We would either consider it a threat to our well bing or just devalue it as lesser than us. Unless of course we found it a benefit to us. Maybe we could enslave it. Maybe we could engage in trade. Maybe we would benefit from an aliance that would help ensure the survival of mankind. But most likely because of our collective ignorance we would just kill it if it was easy to do so. Yes looking back on our history our repeated ignornce in our actions has proven me right. Even if science confirms it as being alive and proves it's value there will be those among us that would not rely on their moral conscience as a guide and would find some \"secular reason\" to kill it.

        "content": "Both Legion and Bruce triggered an eyebrow raise here. For the sake of balancing a clearly tipped scale, let me provide a few points of clarity: 1. In Legion's opening post, he begins with identifying the benefits of scientific progression regardless of religious/non-religious beliefs, but then goes on to attempt redefining a secularist as those who embrace science without moral balance. Watch where you're swinging that broad brush when you make such ridiculous statements. It is offensive to imply that secularists have no morality; that morality is a concept reserved solely for those swinging a holy book. 2. Life takes on many forms... Sometimes it is the unborn fetus within the womb. Other times, it's a mass of cancerous cells. It's a very specific component of what we call \"living\" that Legion failed to identify. Specifically, consciousness (or a soul, whichever you prefer) is what distinguishes one form of life from the other. But who has the right to determine which form gets to live and the other gets \"aborted\". Doesn't the cancer have a right to live? Or is it the fact that cancer isn't human (despite the near-identical genetic makeup) that dooms it to abortion? To be fair, I agree with at least part of Legion's distaste of abortion. It is shameful that some resort to abortion as a means of birth control. I refuse to see tax dollars spent for an abortion because he or she didn't want to be inconvenienced with wearing a condom or some other more responsible form of birth control. Then there is the portion of the dilemma that has opposing sides presenting the abortion issue as the unhindered right to get an abortion versus an outright ban of any abortions. Whether you like it or not, Legion, the most outspoken pro-lifer activists are lobbying to have abortions outlawed completely. You may have a more balanced solution in mind, but it is not what they are fighting to implement. 3. With regards to Bruce's vague reference to Roe v Wade, I'm not suggesting that he hasn't read the material but the supreme court specifically commented that they were not legalizing abortion; that they were only recognizing the right to privacy... Consequently, the Privacy Act was passed the following year. If I wasn't so sleep-deprived, I'd provide a link to the decision briefs. 4. AK already provided the point I was going to use regarding living as a burden or undignified last years... This is a strong point that undeniably goes against typical Western culture; however, despite it's seemingly dispassionate approach, it is still the most dignified recourse for those who recognize the worth of a dignified existence even in the end. Of course, I don't have kids to burden.",

Of course, I don't have kids to burden. Well Sabow, my sabot was meant to raise a few eyebrows. A shot above the brow as it were, a wake up call I appreciate your seemingly well thought out response. Answering your #1 above: A complete reading in context would show where I clarified with this sentence--> \"I believe every man has a conscience but those who spend little time in their growth process of forming a mature moral conscience are limited in their understanding of the implications of the very science they hold as truth.\" Answering your #2 above: Anyone that can with a clear conscience diminish the sanctity of the life of a human being inside the womb of his mother to that of a cancerous cell has fallen victim to this unbalanced \"secular reasoning\". I find it shameful. Man has done the same thing with the slaves and the Jewish and anyone else they wish to manipulate as \"less than human\". With all the science now available that shows the life structure of a baby depending on his mother to nurture him as he grows toward his independence, the eyes, nose, fingers, toes brain function...a human being at his most fragile state, there has to be some sort of deficiency of conscience that could not at least give this baby the benefit of the doubt if secular reasoning allows the doubt due as to any other human. Answering your #4 above: Although euthanasia is similar in reguard to life and death of a human being the life of the baby is not being decided by it's true owner; that being the baby itself. And the baby is not suffering as is the adult human being. The baby will require many more years of nurturing from his mother outside the womb until reaching maturity. But, can't you see how the reason abortion and euthanasia are grouped together in discussions is proof that we are consciously speaking of the life of a human being in both? Discussions on euthanasia recognizes this as fact but then later might say \"oh wait, we need to rethink how we approach this subject\". This is what I mean to show how secular reasoning disreguards the truth of conscience over their political whims. Being educated in science and politics should not disreguard or override their conscience when making their judgements especially in reguards to a human life whether inside or out of the womb. Lastly Sabow, I don't figure you as one of the radical thinkers that I originally mentioned. You seem well balanced. I just appeal to you to take into consideration that you just might be misguided by all the liberal hype on this most important subject of preserving the life of the innocent inside the womb. Because of my conscience I agree with many liberal movements but in this one they are just dead wrong. Secular reasoning needs to clear it's conscience. - LegionSon -",
