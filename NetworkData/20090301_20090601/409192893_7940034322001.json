About 30 activists gathered near a university in southwestern Moscow to protest discrimination against gays and lesbians in Russia. The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" After about a minute, riot police charged into the group and began to grab protesters, dragging them to waiting buses. Tatchell was talking with reporters when police started to haul him away. \"This shows the Russian people are not free,\" he said. Russian gay rights movement leader Nikolai Alexeyev was among those detained. After the demonstration, riot police detained other gay activists who appeared after the protest and were speaking with the media. As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. City authorities had barred Saturday's rally saying it was morally wrong. Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described homosexuality as \"satanic.\" The detentions come as Moscow prepares to host the final of the Eurovision song contest, Europe's most prestigious pop music contest. The international competition has drawn attention to gay rights in Russia, with some singers threatening to boycott the event if the gay pride parade was not allowed to happen. At an earlier rally close to the center of Moscow, about 50 demonstrators from nationalist and Orthodox Christian organizations denounced homosexuality. One man was detained when he accused officials in the Kremlin of being gay.",

This is why we say Freedom comes with a Price..and Freedom isn't Free. There is always a price someone must pay to earn it. American Soldiers have shed their blood for many countries around the globe peoples freedoms..the price was paid for by American Blood being shed on their soil.

If protesting became against the law here, people would still make the choice to protest and thus make the choice to suffer the consequences of that choice. That is one of the many prices people pay in the battle for certain freedoms, and sometimes that price may be the loss of life. If one is not willing to suffer those consequences of their choice in such matters, then they need to stay home or find something else to do, but even they must live with their decision to do nothing. This is why we say Freedom comes with a Price..and Freedom isn't Free. There is always a price someone must pay to earn it. American Soldiers have shed their blood for many countries around the globe peoples freedoms..the price was paid for by American Blood being shed on their soil. Just as in Christianity..people say Salvation is free..that's a lie..the cost for that salvation was the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross.. Either way, it was the shedding of innocent blood for the freedom of others. This message has been edited. Last edited by: 3678131, Sat 16 May 2009 08:26 AM",

The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" Let's try this: The police had the authority and backing of headquarters. Did you all somehow miss the words... gay pride rally that was banned by city authorities!! No means NO!! These people weren't going down without a fight and a fight is exactly what they were expecting. It is therefore my opinion that while I may not agree with force, I do not agree with civil disobediance either. The police had the freedom, authority and support of the city offices. Like it or not, the protestors knew what they were getting into when they started. They chose to ignore the banning.", 
        "reply": " No means No in the Russian Federation. That said, I still support their protest regardless of the authorities denying them that right. But, that's a American thing I suppose. The right to have freedom of expression, regardless of the specific protest. All it shows is that the Russian govt. is no different than the Soviet govt. just because flags may change, doesn't mean govt. policy changes. No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

Moscow police violently break up gay pride rally MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Moscow police violently dispersed a gay pride rally Saturday that was banned by city authorities, drawing attention to Russia's record on gay rights as it prepares to host a major international pop music competition. About 30 activists gathered near a university in southwestern Moscow to protest discrimination against gays and lesbians in Russia. The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" After about a minute, riot police charged into the group and began to grab protesters, dragging them to waiting buses. Tatchell was talking with reporters when police started to haul him away. \"This shows the Russian people are not free,\" he said. Russian gay rights movement leader Nikolai Alexeyev was among those detained. After the demonstration, riot police detained other gay activists who appeared after the protest and were speaking with the media. As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. City authorities had barred Saturday's rally saying it was morally wrong. Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described homosexuality as \"satanic.\" The detentions come as Moscow prepares to host the final of the Eurovision song contest, Europe's most prestigious pop music contest.

Moscow police violently break up gay pride rally MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Moscow police violently dispersed a gay pride rally Saturday that was banned by city authorities, drawing attention to Russia's record on gay rights as it prepares to host a major international pop music competition. About 30 activists gathered near a university in southwestern Moscow to protest discrimination against gays and lesbians in Russia. The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" After about a minute, riot police charged into the group and began to grab protesters, dragging them to waiting buses. Tatchell was talking with reporters when police started to haul him away. \"This shows the Russian people are not free,\" he said. Russian gay rights movement leader Nikolai Alexeyev was among those detained. After the demonstration, riot police detained other gay activists who appeared after the protest and were speaking with the media. As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. City authorities had barred Saturday's rally saying it was morally wrong. Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described homosexuality as \"satanic.\" The detentions come as Moscow prepares to host the final of the Eurovision song contest, Europe's most prestigious pop music contest.

Is it your contention that the ability to do such things is a sign of Freedom? Alternatively, are you suggesting a desire for the same to be possible in the USA? I hope neither, since either choice would spotlight you in a very negative light. \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",

If protesting became against the law here, people would still make the choice to protest and thus make the choice to suffer the consequences of that choice. That is one of the many prices people pay in the battle for certain freedoms, and sometimes that price may be the loss of life. If one is not willing to suffer those consequences of their choice in such matters, then they need to stay home or find something else to do, but even they must live with their decision to do nothing. This is why we say Freedom comes with a Price..and Freedom isn't Free. There is always a price someone must pay to earn it. American Soldiers have shed their blood for many countries around the globe peoples freedoms..the price was paid for by American Blood being shed on their soil. Just as in Christianity..people say Salvation is free..that's a lie..the cost for that salvation was the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross..

        "reply": " No means No in the Russian Federation. That said, I still support their protest regardless of the authorities denying them that right. But, that's a American thing I suppose. The right to have freedom of expression, regardless of the specific protest. All it shows is that the Russian govt. is no different than the Soviet govt. just because flags may change, doesn't mean govt. policy changes. No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" After about a minute, riot police charged into the group and began to grab protesters, dragging them to waiting buses. Tatchell was talking with reporters when police started to haul him away. \"This shows the Russian people are not free,\" he said. Russian gay rights movement leader Nikolai Alexeyev was among those detained. After the demonstration, riot police detained other gay activists who appeared after the protest and were speaking with the media. As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. City authorities had barred Saturday's rally saying it was morally wrong. Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described homosexuality as \"satanic.\" The detentions come as Moscow prepares to host the final of the Eurovision song contest, Europe's most prestigious pop music contest. The international competition has drawn attention to gay rights in Russia, with some singers threatening to boycott the event if the gay pride parade was not allowed to happen. At an earlier rally close to the center of Moscow, about 50 demonstrators from nationalist and Orthodox Christian organizations denounced homosexuality. One man was detained when he accused officials in the Kremlin of being gay.",

The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" After about a minute, riot police charged into the group and began to grab protesters, dragging them to waiting buses. Tatchell was talking with reporters when police started to haul him away. \"This shows the Russian people are not free,\" he said. Russian gay rights movement leader Nikolai Alexeyev was among those detained. After the demonstration, riot police detained other gay activists who appeared after the protest and were speaking with the media. As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. City authorities had barred Saturday's rally saying it was morally wrong. Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described homosexuality as \"satanic.\" The detentions come as Moscow prepares to host the final of the Eurovision song contest, Europe's most prestigious pop music contest. The international competition has drawn attention to gay rights in Russia, with some singers threatening to boycott the event if the gay pride parade was not allowed to happen. At an earlier rally close to the center of Moscow, about 50 demonstrators from nationalist and Orthodox Christian organizations denounced homosexuality. One man was detained when he accused officials in the Kremlin of being gay.",

That is one of the many prices people pay in the battle for certain freedoms, and sometimes that price may be the loss of life. If one is not willing to suffer those consequences of their choice in such matters, then they need to stay home or find something else to do, but even they must live with their decision to do nothing. This is why we say Freedom comes with a Price..and Freedom isn't Free. There is always a price someone must pay to earn it. American Soldiers have shed their blood for many countries around the globe peoples freedoms..the price was paid for by American Blood being shed on their soil. Just as in Christianity..people say Salvation is free..that's a lie..the cost for that salvation was the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross.. Either way, it was the shedding of innocent blood for the freedom of others. This message has been edited. Last edited by: 3678131, Sat 16 May 2009 08:26 AM",

If protesting became against the law here, people would still make the choice to protest and thus make the choice to suffer the consequences of that choice. That is one of the many prices people pay in the battle for certain freedoms, and sometimes that price may be the loss of life. If one is not willing to suffer those consequences of their choice in such matters, then they need to stay home or find something else to do, but even they must live with their decision to do nothing. This is why we say Freedom comes with a Price..and Freedom isn't Free. There is always a price someone must pay to earn it. American Soldiers have shed their blood for many countries around the globe peoples freedoms..the price was paid for by American Blood being shed on their soil. Just as in Christianity..people say Salvation is free..that's a lie..the cost for that salvation was the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross.. Either way, it was the shedding of innocent blood for the freedom of others. This message has been edited. Last edited by: 3678131, Sat 16 May 2009 08:26 AM",

About 30 activists gathered near a university in southwestern Moscow to protest discrimination against gays and lesbians in Russia. The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" After about a minute, riot police charged into the group and began to grab protesters, dragging them to waiting buses. Tatchell was talking with reporters when police started to haul him away. \"This shows the Russian people are not free,\" he said. Russian gay rights movement leader Nikolai Alexeyev was among those detained. After the demonstration, riot police detained other gay activists who appeared after the protest and were speaking with the media. As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. City authorities had barred Saturday's rally saying it was morally wrong. Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described homosexuality as \"satanic.\" The detentions come as Moscow prepares to host the final of the Eurovision song contest, Europe's most prestigious pop music contest.

At an earlier rally close to the center of Moscow, about 50 demonstrators from nationalist and Orthodox Christian organizations denounced homosexuality.

I guess if these things are against the law and the city had banned the rally then the police were doing their job, it sounds as if they went overboard in doing so..but they were still doing their job.. But, if this is an important issue to the people who live there; they should be willing to accept the consequences of their choice to break their law. Do I think the people should have the right to protests? Yes, I do. quote: As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. I believe the police went to far in this instance, I don't know of anything that would require such an action. If protesting became against the law here, people would still make the choice to protest and thus make the choice to suffer the consequences of that choice. That is one of the many prices people pay in the battle for certain freedoms, and sometimes that price may be the loss of life. If one is not willing to suffer those consequences of their choice in such matters, then they need to stay home or find something else to do, but even they must live with their decision to do nothing. This is why we say Freedom comes with a Price..and Freedom isn't Free. There is always a price someone must pay to earn it. American Soldiers have shed their blood for many countries around the globe peoples freedoms..the price was paid for by American Blood being shed on their soil. Just as in Christianity..people say Salvation is free..that's a lie..the cost for that salvation was the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross.. Either way, it was the shedding of innocent blood for the freedom of others. This message has been edited. Last edited by: 3678131, Sat 16 May 2009 08:26 AM",

        "reply": "Duster6:  quote: City authorities had barred Saturday's rally Do I agree with the arrests? I guess if these things are against the law and the city had banned the rally then the police were doing their job, it sounds as if they went overboard in doing so..but they were still doing their job.. But, if this is an important issue to the people who live there; they should be willing to accept the consequences of their choice to break their law. Do I think the people should have the right to protests? Yes, I do. quote: As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. I believe the police went to far in this instance, I don't know of anything that would require such an action. If protesting became against the law here, people would still make the choice to protest and thus make the choice to suffer the consequences of that choice. That is one of the many prices people pay in the battle for certain freedoms, and sometimes that price may be the loss of life. If one is not willing to suffer those consequences of their choice in such matters, then they need to stay home or find something else to do, but even they must live with their decision to do nothing.

About 30 activists gathered near a university in southwestern Moscow to protest discrimination against gays and lesbians in Russia. The group, which included British gay rights advocate Peter Tatchell, waved flags and chanted slogans, including: \"Homophobia is a disgrace of this country!\" and \"We are demanding equal rights!\" After about a minute, riot police charged into the group and began to grab protesters, dragging them to waiting buses. Tatchell was talking with reporters when police started to haul him away. \"This shows the Russian people are not free,\" he said. Russian gay rights movement leader Nikolai Alexeyev was among those detained. After the demonstration, riot police detained other gay activists who appeared after the protest and were speaking with the media. As they hauled away Ksenia Prilebskaya, police ripped off her shirt and bra and roughly pushed her into a police bus. City authorities had barred Saturday's rally saying it was morally wrong.

The international competition has drawn attention to gay rights in Russia, with some singers threatening to boycott the event if the gay pride parade was not allowed to happen. At an earlier rally close to the center of Moscow, about 50 demonstrators from nationalist and Orthodox Christian organizations denounced homosexuality.
