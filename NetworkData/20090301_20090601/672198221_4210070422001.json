The fisrt instant reported here and developed by the Washington Post, relates the murder of a US citizen, possibly working as a contractor. He was reputedly abducted while leaving a store in the zone, to be found later - blindfolded and bound in a car with multiple stab wounds and his throat cut. The death, written off as the result of a possible personal disagreement, is the first murder involving a US citizen in the zone. The second death, from a rocket strike later in the day, underlines an increased number of rocket and mortar attacks recently. It is feared these will become even more frequent should US forces withdraw from the Shiite part of Baghdad across the river.",
