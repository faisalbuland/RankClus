Online, comparing her own controversial pictures to leaked photos of Carrie, which showed the then-17-year-old model exposing her breast and flashing her underwear. In December of 2006, Trump stripped Rees of her title after he deemed her photos inappropriate. \"I don't know why I am the only one who was punished for their behavior,\" she said. \"I was only 19 when those photos were taken of me, and it was me in my personal life, far before I was crowned Miss Nevada. Carrie actually posed for these professional semi-nude photos... I think that's worse.\"",
