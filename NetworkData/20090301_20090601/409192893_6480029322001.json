But I believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values. The documents that we hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment. They are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world. I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents. My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered. My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land. My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- \"to form a more perfect union.\" I've studied the Constitution as a student, I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator. I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake. I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism. We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe. Time and again, our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval. Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world. It's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from America's Armed Forces than from their own government. It's the reason why America has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries. It's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty. From Europe to the Pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law. That is who we are. And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology. After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out.<SNIP> <SNIP>First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America. (Applause.) I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe. I could not disagree more. As Commander-in-Chief, I see the intelligence. I bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe. And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation. (Applause.) What's more, they undermine the rule of law. They alienate us in the world. They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured. In short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all. (Applause.) Now, I should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration. As Senator McCain once said, torture \"serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us.\" And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history. That's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past. They are not who we are, and they are not America. The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)<SNIP> Full Transcript",

Barack Obama's deadly new torture weapon in the war on terror: his oratory James Delingpole <edit> <edit> 'http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/james_delingpole/blog/2009/05/22/barack_obamas_deadly_new_torture_weapon_in_the_war_on_terror_his_oratory' Watching Obama lose his screen on screen duel with Dick Cheney yesterday I was reminded of some lines from Paradise Lost. \"Thus Belial with words clothed in reason's garb Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth, not peace.\" But while the silver-tongued minor devil Belial would no doubt have approved the President's new surrender-monkey \"realist\" approach to the war on terror, I doubt he would have been so impressed with his oratorical skills. Never mind the bizarre reputation Obama has acquired as a great public speaker: his speeches are fast beginning to sound almost as excruciating as anything in his predecessor's \"enhanced interrogation program.\" Yeah, I know, I know. I too was taken in when I first heard him speak. I remember thinking when I heard that measured, steady voice with its pleasant but authoritative timbre that here was a guy fit to govern the world. He sounded cool. Clint Eastwood \"Make my day\" cool. Now, though, that novelty has worn off. Now, it's becoming clear that this carefully worked, glacial poise is all there is to Obama. He's just a hollow man spouting empty rhetoric. Compare and contrast the flatulent pomposity of Obama's speech with Cheney's angry, from-the-heart, tell-it-like-it-is riposte. No one is accusing Cheney of being the next Marc Antony but as Toby Harnden rightly says, he had some strong points to make and his audience got the message. Obama's speech on the other hand, was the usual grandiloquent exercise in high-sounding nothingness. Apart from the familiar gangsta-rap-style boasting about how big and important he now is (\"I took an oath as your Commander In Chief..\"), all he had to offer were platitudes designed - a la Belial - to make inaction and pusillanimity in the war on terror look the only sensible course. One of his favourite techniques is the false opposition, as here: \"On one side of the spectrum are those who make little allowance for the the unique challenges posed by terrorism and would almost never put national security over transparency. And on the other end of the spectrum are those who can embrace a view that can be summarised in two words: anything goes. Both sides may be sincere in their views. But neither is right.\" Except nobody in the world cleaves to either of these positions. They have been conjured from thin air by Obama - and his trusty teleprompter - in order to make out that anyone who disagrees with his woolly centrist position must perforce be some kind of whacko extremist nut job. Maybe when you're out on the campaign trail there's a certain sense in this kind of airy nonsense: you don't after all want to pin yourself down to a position your opponents can trap you on; you just want to generate a general feeling of benevolence towards you. But when you're president of the USA, this approach really doesn't wash. You have responsibilities. Your words have consequences. A deadpan delivery is no longer enough.",

It's funny how you have some very highly intelligent people on these boards (no, I'm not of them) who have made a sensible case for Obama'a policies, and yet you and your cohorts keep on repeating like broken records; \"It's where the elites would prefer and are leading us to be.....in their sphincter.

But I believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values. The documents that we hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment. They are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world. I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents. My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered. My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land. My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- \"to form a more perfect union.\" I've studied the Constitution as a student, I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator. I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake. I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism. We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe. Time and again, our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval. Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world. It's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from America's Armed Forces than from their own government. It's the reason why America has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries. It's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty. From Europe to the Pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law. That is who we are. And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology. After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out.<SNIP> <SNIP>First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America. (Applause.) I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe. I could not disagree more. As Commander-in-Chief, I see the intelligence. I bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe. And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation. (Applause.) What's more, they undermine the rule of law. They alienate us in the world. They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured. In short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all. (Applause.) Now, I should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration. As Senator McCain once said, torture \"serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us.\" And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history. That's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past. They are not who we are, and they are not America. The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)<SNIP> Full Transcript",

Barack Obama's deadly new torture weapon in the war on terror: his oratory James Delingpole <edit> <edit> 'http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/james_delingpole/blog/2009/05/22/barack_obamas_deadly_new_torture_weapon_in_the_war_on_terror_his_oratory' Watching Obama lose his screen on screen duel with Dick Cheney yesterday I was reminded of some lines from Paradise Lost. \"Thus Belial with words clothed in reason's garb Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth, not peace.\" But while the silver-tongued minor devil Belial would no doubt have approved the President's new surrender-monkey \"realist\" approach to the war on terror, I doubt he would have been so impressed with his oratorical skills. Never mind the bizarre reputation Obama has acquired as a great public speaker: his speeches are fast beginning to sound almost as excruciating as anything in his predecessor's \"enhanced interrogation program.\" Yeah, I know, I know. I too was taken in when I first heard him speak. I remember thinking when I heard that measured, steady voice with its pleasant but authoritative timbre that here was a guy fit to govern the world. He sounded cool. Clint Eastwood \"Make my day\" cool. Now, though, that novelty has worn off. Now, it's becoming clear that this carefully worked, glacial poise is all there is to Obama. He's just a hollow man spouting empty rhetoric. Compare and contrast the flatulent pomposity of Obama's speech with Cheney's angry, from-the-heart, tell-it-like-it-is riposte. No one is accusing Cheney of being the next Marc Antony but as Toby Harnden rightly says, he had some strong points to make and his audience got the message. Obama's speech on the other hand, was the usual grandiloquent exercise in high-sounding nothingness. Apart from the familiar gangsta-rap-style boasting about how big and important he now is (\"I took an oath as your Commander In Chief..\"), all he had to offer were platitudes designed - a la Belial - to make inaction and pusillanimity in the war on terror look the only sensible course. One of his favourite techniques is the false opposition, as here: \"On one side of the spectrum are those who make little allowance for the the unique challenges posed by terrorism and would almost never put national security over transparency. And on the other end of the spectrum are those who can embrace a view that can be summarised in two words: anything goes. Both sides may be sincere in their views. But neither is right.\" Except nobody in the world cleaves to either of these positions. They have been conjured from thin air by Obama - and his trusty teleprompter - in order to make out that anyone who disagrees with his woolly centrist position must perforce be some kind of whacko extremist nut job. Maybe when you're out on the campaign trail there's a certain sense in this kind of airy nonsense: you don't after all want to pin yourself down to a position your opponents can trap you on; you just want to generate a general feeling of benevolence towards you. But when you're president of the USA, this approach really doesn't wash. You have responsibilities. Your words have consequences. A deadpan delivery is no longer enough.",

They only take dollars and not many of us have those any more!! Thats not completely true. Its the best of times and the worst of times depending on where you sit. Here on LI I cant see how anything has changed drastically except for maybe gas and cigarettes. The roads, parks, restraunts, beaches, shopping malls, are crowded as usual and people are spending like drunken sailors on shore leave. The market these past months have been making some a small fortune and recouping the losses. Stcks are moving and when someone is selling someone is buying. Its been a great opportunity to make some real money for those who were able. Unfortunately most people were conned and did this to themselves by over extended and buying things they didnt need and could not afford living a fairy tale lifestyle on credit. Bad position to be in when the bottom drops out and it always does. When all is said and done the rich will be far richer and the poor will be far poorer. But saddly the worst part is they wont have learned a thing.",
