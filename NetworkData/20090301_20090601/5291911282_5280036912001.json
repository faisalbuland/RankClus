My buddy and I were stationed at Dover AFB and had only been TDY to CAFB for three days. Anyway, I saw her the next morning at breakfast in the dinning hall. I asked could I set with her, she said, with a shrug, sure. It was just breakfast and very little talk. By the time I left the table, I knew that she was the one for me. 27 days later we were married. It took me three weeks for me to convince her that she should marry me. That was 48+ years ago. I\u2019m happier and more in love with her now than I ever dreamed possible. I can\u2019t even conceive life with out her. I resigned from BFL after the breakfast meeting.
