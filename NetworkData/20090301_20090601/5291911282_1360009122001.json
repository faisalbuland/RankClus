If you are out, you clearance is not technically active, but you should have receive a pretty extensive \"out-briefing/de-briefing\" which included the signing of a very specific document that said you can be prosecuted for any breech of security or divulging of any sensitive material for 10 Years... They ain't kidding about that... I have no idea what areas you dealt with classified in, and I don't want to know - but you can still be hanged for even hinting at it to a person from a country in question. And you are just the kind of person who will be targeted by the \"threat\" if you have not been out very long, and your area was extremely sensitive - especially if you still have \"friends/buddies\" on the other side, who might still be \"hot\" and can be connected with - - Best to be very aware and aloof. She also could be working for CID or FBI - Wheels within Wheels You might be on thin ice in multiple ways. I'd suggest keeping your mouth shut, steering clear, and getting some face to face advice from an active Security Manager immediately - - Wandering and Wondering",
