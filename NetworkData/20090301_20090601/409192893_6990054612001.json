The money will go to one woman who took part in the experiments and the families of 11 other people who have died. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary announced the settlement in New York. \"This settlement goes to the very heart of the moral accountability the government owes it citizens,\" O'Leary said in prepared remarks. \"We are grateful to the families for the tough lessons they have taught us about trust, responsibility and accountability between the government and the people.\" The agreement represents the final settlement in 12 of 18 human radiation experiment cases involving the injection of plutonium and uranium, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The tests sprang from efforts to develop atomic weapons. \"The purpose of the research worker safety was laudable,\" Ruth Faden, head of an advisory panel on human radiation experiments appointed by President Clinton, said previously. \"Unfortunately, the way they went about it was wrong.\" The committee found that it was not uncommon for doctors to use patients as test subjects without their knowledge in the 1940s.

The tests sprang from efforts to develop atomic weapons. \"The purpose of the research worker safety was laudable,\" Ruth Faden, head of an advisory panel on human radiation experiments appointed by President Clinton, said previously. \"Unfortunately, the way they went about it was wrong.\" The committee found that it was not uncommon for doctors to use patients as test subjects without their knowledge in the 1940s. Doctors believe the deaths of the 11 deceased experiment victims were not related to the experiments.",

Good point Bill. Thats exactly how I felt when 25 years after the tests i participated in, I got a letter from the Air foce saying the radiation exposure I was subjected to was well within the safe levels. Then went on to encourage me to check in to a VA hospital for a complete Check up.",

Yes it was way out of line and yet till this day they wont acknowlege their responsibility to these vets or thier families that have suffered greatly. I remember when the fighter A/C that flew through the cloud after the fireball rose and dissipated packed with instruments for extended times, Had landed and taxied into designated Hot areas. The Planes were so contaminated That the pilots were lifted out of the A/C with fork lifts to avoid touching the out side surfaces. Yet they sent in troops with no more than rainsuits and plastic Face shields toscrub these plans down. That was followed by 3 seperate decontamination tent showers each one monitored by Medics with Geiger counters measuring radiation before you entered each tent and as you left. Later released secret documents showed they were testing soaps. When I was a member of the AVA I wrote many letters to my state congressmen among which were Chuch Schumer who failed to respond, and Hilliary Clinton who did respond but never touched on the subject matter and said how much she has done for veterans. They wont touch it with a ten foot pole even though there is a reccommendation for a AV service medal sitting on congresses desk for over 50 years. I had the opportunity to discuss this with General Pace while he was CJCS at an affair I attended. I showed him a letter from a vet that mailed me asking me where he could replace a lost certificate that was issued by the task force commander when we left. I sent him a copy of mine with his name on it. This guy had less than six months left to live at best and here he was thinking about that old Redwing certificate issued over 50 years ago. I told the general how much even a presidential letter of commendation would mean to these few remaining in recognition of thier sevice. He was as honest as he could be in his position and basically said it would open a pandoras box in so many words. He sent me his personal letter of commendation and gratitude for my service which hangs on my den wall.",
