If enacted it would establish a Veterans' Corps that identifies unmet needs of veterans through the following activities: \u2022 Promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is deployed and upon that family member's return home; \u2022 Recruit veterans, particularly returning veterans, into service opportunities, including such opportunities that reflect their military experience; \u2022 Work to assist veterans in developing their educational opportunities, including opportunities for professional certification, licensure, and credentials. This would include coordinating with and assisting State and local agencies administering veterans education benefits and programs for internships and fellowships that could lead to employment in the private and public sector; \u2022 Promote efforts within the community to serve the needs of veterans and members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty, including such efforts to help veterans file benefits claims and assist Federal agencies in providing services to veterans; \u2022 Assist veterans in developing mentoring relationships with economically disadvantaged students; \u2022 Develop projects to assist disabled, rural, unemployed, and older veterans, including such projects that assist such veterans with transportation; and \u2022 Support other activities addressing unmet veterans' needs as may be designated.

Helping veterans file claims, finding evidence to proscecute the claim and getting them into education programs, as well as assisting on employment seeking. We have well trained veterans assisting returnees in finding a job. I totally agree with Ruanne on this comment \"The unemployment and homeless rate for recent Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is (rightly) embarrassing people who supported the troops and swore the same thing would not happen to new vets as did to Vietnam vets.\" In my office several times each week OEF and OIF veterans come in for help and they get it! Even though I do not have all the answers I know where to find them. We are already trained to serve our fellow veteran. Many VSO's like AMVETS, DAV, the Legion, MOPH, PVA, and the VFW depend on donations for their budget. Donations have been down since the 911 disaster. For a considerable time the overwheming amount of donated funds went to the American Red Cross and the veterans donations dropped. Some of our organizations had to close offices and lay off some of their veterans service officers and staff. Again, not to argue, but to simply give an opinion. The funding should go to the proven method of assisting veterans rather than another government beaureaucracy. Important note: Recently Military.com changed their policy on profiles.

I totally agree with Ruanne on this comment \"The unemployment and homeless rate for recent Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is (rightly) embarrassing people who supported the troops and swore the same thing would not happen to new vets as did to Vietnam vets.\" In my office several times each week OEF and OIF veterans come in for help and they get it! Even though I do not have all the answers I know where to find them. We are already trained to serve our fellow veteran. Many VSO's like AMVETS, DAV, the Legion, MOPH, PVA, and the VFW depend on donations for their budget. Donations have been down since the 911 disaster. For a considerable time the overwheming amount of donated funds went to the American Red Cross and the veterans donations dropped. Some of our organizations had to close offices and lay off some of their veterans service officers and staff. Again, not to argue, but to simply give an opinion. The funding should go to the proven method of assisting veterans rather than another government beaureaucracy. Important note: Recently Military.com changed their policy on profiles.

Many times I have wanted to e-mail a member to give more advice, or to ask additional questions and could not, because they chose Private Profile. With this new system, you should put in the data needed for us to help you. It will only be available to \"Friends\" you added.

VIDEO ONLINE After fighting for his country in Iraq, 26-year-old Marine Ruben Medina will soon face another battle--landing a civilian job in a recessionary economy. Ruben, who will exit the military in June, was among more than 340 Veterans who attended a job fair here Thursday, presented by RecruitMilitary that was designed to help connect job seekers with military backgrounds to employers. Despite the 9 percent unemployment rate in the Chicago metropolitan area, Ruben, who has worked as a military mechanic, said he's optimistic he'll find work. \"I know there are jobs out there that I'm highly qualified for,\" he said. But other job fair attendees expressed concern. Among them 24-year-old Scott Meder of Orland Park, who said he's next in line to be laid off from his job as a diesel mechanic. The Veteran expects to be cut in June. \"It's a reality check coming from the military where the jobs are secure to getting back out in the civilian world, with the economic crisis we're going through right now,\" said Meder, who left the military last May. \"The reality hits more so when you're out on your own and you don't have that stable paycheck from the government. It's a pretty tough market.\" Indeed, USA Today reported last month that the jobless rate for Veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was 11.2 percent in February. The Labor Department said the 2008 unemployment rate for those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces since September 2001 was 7.3 percent. Veterans sometimes face biases from employers when seeking work, job fair attendees said. Combat veterans are sometimes unfairly perceived as having a short fuse, said 39-year-old Rico Johnson, who served in Operation Desert Storm. He said he was laid off in December from the city of Chicago's Streets and Sanitation department and has applied for some 300 jobs. \"It's rough,\" he said of the job market. \"There's been a lot of promises. But nobody's calling.\" Some employers question whether Veterans can adjust to the civilian sector, \"coming from a very regimented way of life into a little bit more of a relaxed atmosphere,\" said John Lundberg, RecruitMilitary's national career fair representative. He and other attendees said Veterans can adjust and bring to the table transferrable skills, reliability and a great work ethic. \"You think that because you're a Veteran, you have military experience it's' a lot easier to get hired, but sometimes employers don't even care,\" said 26-year-old Gina Horvath. The Chicagoan served in the Army from 2000 to 2004 and is a member of the National Guard. The former bank teller has been out of work since last August. \"Being a Veteran isn't going to give you any cool points,\" she said. Forty-one-year old Charles Hollister, also unemployed, echoed those sentiments. \"You'd ordinarily think that the people that sacrificed themselves for the freedom of the country would get first consideration, but that's just not always the case,\" he said. \"In fact, a lot of times it's outright hostility, and you'd think it would be the other way around.\" These are challenging times for Veterans and non-Veterans alike, said 23-year-old Veteran Leon Leak, who has a part-time job. The Hyde Park resident got out of the Marines in February. He's currently working on his MBA and working part-time. He said he worked in network operations and as a senior communications person. He's looking for an information technology, Web technology or communications position. \"Veterans as well as people who haven't served in the military are having the same problem,\" he said. \"Right now it's a limited job market and everybody's fighting for positions. So everybody needs to make themselves marketable and try their best to make it work. That's all we can do--and pray.\" I will cast no stones. Proud member of the RD-DV!

If enacted it would establish a Veterans' Corps that identifies unmet needs of veterans through the following activities: \u2022 Promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is deployed and upon that family member's return home; \u2022 Recruit veterans, particularly returning veterans, into service opportunities, including such opportunities that reflect their military experience; \u2022 Work to assist veterans in developing their educational opportunities, including opportunities for professional certification, licensure, and credentials. This would include coordinating with and assisting State and local agencies administering veterans education benefits and programs for internships and fellowships that could lead to employment in the private and public sector; \u2022 Promote efforts within the community to serve the needs of veterans and members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty, including such efforts to help veterans file benefits claims and assist Federal agencies in providing services to veterans; \u2022 Assist veterans in developing mentoring relationships with economically disadvantaged students; \u2022 Develop projects to assist disabled, rural, unemployed, and older veterans, including such projects that assist such veterans with transportation; and \u2022 Support other activities addressing unmet veterans' needs as may be designated.

Why do we need Veteran's to be paid for what Veteran's Service Organizations such as the VFW and DAV already do for free? Is that just another boondoggle? A waste of our money? Or is it justified? Why, or why not? VETERANS CORPS: The Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act or the \"GIVE Act passed by the House was read twice and placed on the Senate calendar 19 MAR 09. It is an Act to amend the national service laws which were enacted by the National And Community Service Act (NSCA) of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA) and reauthorize appropriations through FY2014. If enacted it would establish a Veterans' Corps that identifies unmet needs of veterans through the following activities: \u2022 Promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is deployed and upon that family member's return home; \u2022 Recruit veterans, particularly returning veterans, into service opportunities, including such opportunities that reflect their military experience; \u2022 Work to assist veterans in developing their educational opportunities, including opportunities for professional certification, licensure, and credentials. This would include coordinating with and assisting State and local agencies administering veterans education benefits and programs for internships and fellowships that could lead to employment in the private and public sector; \u2022 Promote efforts within the community to serve the needs of veterans and members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty, including such efforts to help veterans file benefits claims and assist Federal agencies in providing services to veterans; \u2022 Assist veterans in developing mentoring relationships with economically disadvantaged students; \u2022 Develop projects to assist disabled, rural, unemployed, and older veterans, including such projects that assist such veterans with transportation; and \u2022 Support other activities addressing unmet veterans' needs as may be designated.

(Al Podgorski/Sun-Times) Telling their stories: Veterans talk about the job market from their perspective. Go to suntimes.com. VIDEO ONLINE After fighting for his country in Iraq, 26-year-old Marine Ruben Medina will soon face another battle--landing a civilian job in a recessionary economy. Ruben, who will exit the military in June, was among more than 340 Veterans who attended a job fair here Thursday, presented by RecruitMilitary that was designed to help connect job seekers with military backgrounds to employers. Despite the 9 percent unemployment rate in the Chicago metropolitan area, Ruben, who has worked as a military mechanic, said he's optimistic he'll find work. \"I know there are jobs out there that I'm highly qualified for,\" he said. But other job fair attendees expressed concern. Among them 24-year-old Scott Meder of Orland Park, who said he's next in line to be laid off from his job as a diesel mechanic. The Veteran expects to be cut in June. \"It's a reality check coming from the military where the jobs are secure to getting back out in the civilian world, with the economic crisis we're going through right now,\" said Meder, who left the military last May. \"The reality hits more so when you're out on your own and you don't have that stable paycheck from the government. It's a pretty tough market.\" Indeed, USA Today reported last month that the jobless rate for Veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was 11.2 percent in February. The Labor Department said the 2008 unemployment rate for those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces since September 2001 was 7.3 percent. Veterans sometimes face biases from employers when seeking work, job fair attendees said. Combat veterans are sometimes unfairly perceived as having a short fuse, said 39-year-old Rico Johnson, who served in Operation Desert Storm. He said he was laid off in December from the city of Chicago's Streets and Sanitation department and has applied for some 300 jobs. \"It's rough,\" he said of the job market. \"There's been a lot of promises. But nobody's calling.\" Some employers question whether Veterans can adjust to the civilian sector, \"coming from a very regimented way of life into a little bit more of a relaxed atmosphere,\" said John Lundberg, RecruitMilitary's national career fair representative. He and other attendees said Veterans can adjust and bring to the table transferrable skills, reliability and a great work ethic. \"You think that because you're a Veteran, you have military experience it's' a lot easier to get hired, but sometimes employers don't even care,\" said 26-year-old Gina Horvath. The Chicagoan served in the Army from 2000 to 2004 and is a member of the National Guard. The former bank teller has been out of work since last August. \"Being a Veteran isn't going to give you any cool points,\" she said. Forty-one-year old Charles Hollister, also unemployed, echoed those sentiments. \"You'd ordinarily think that the people that sacrificed themselves for the freedom of the country would get first consideration, but that's just not always the case,\" he said. \"In fact, a lot of times it's outright hostility, and you'd think it would be the other way around.\" These are challenging times for Veterans and non-Veterans alike, said 23-year-old Veteran Leon Leak, who has a part-time job. The Hyde Park resident got out of the Marines in February. He's currently working on his MBA and working part-time. He said he worked in network operations and as a senior communications person. He's looking for an information technology, Web technology or communications position. \"Veterans as well as people who haven't served in the military are having the same problem,\" he said. \"Right now it's a limited job market and everybody's fighting for positions. So everybody needs to make themselves marketable and try their best to make it work. That's all we can do--and pray.\" I will cast no stones. Proud member of the RD-DV!
