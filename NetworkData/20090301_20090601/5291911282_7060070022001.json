His mug shot have me the creeps, I would imagine he will get some sort of deal in the liberal atmosphere that evades this part of the country and this city. Heck the mayor had a relationship with a younger man (minor) and then he denied it (liar,liar). But then he is a politician but the children's author is another story. I can imagine that since he is a children's author and has that imagination that comes with that type of job, then he has probably written some stuff under psuedonym's for the \"dirt bag rags\". It will be interesting to see what happens in this case (JMO). Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
