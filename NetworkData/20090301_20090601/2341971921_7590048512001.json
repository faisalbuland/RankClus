The way to resolve a \"combatant\" who is inside a school with children and other civilians also inside is to: evacuate the children / civilians, then engage the armed \"combatant(s)\". The organized Israeli Army solution is to blow up the whole building, with both civilians and combatant(s). How very noble of you. WOW, what a tough, proud, honorable military you have there. Perhaps you should ask yourself, \"would the Americans do this?\" And your response is an example of why the conflict in Israel has lasted so many decades. The Israelis commit an injustice. Like displacing / evicting a whole village into refugees. Then those victim(s) react with violence. Then the Israelis kill a whole neighborhood to respond. Then the victims respond with violence. And on, and on, and on.... Do you see an end to this cycle? Unless you can kill everyone, there is no end. OR you could stop the injustices, beginning with the \"right to return\". People will obviously fight for their homes and land. Just because you stole it, or you developed it, or the British said they wouldn't mind, does NOT MAKE IT YOURS. Either pay for it, or let them have it back. Anything else is just plain wrong, and will not lead to peace. In the mean time, blockading people into starvation will not make them peaceful neighbors either. Only justice will. The sooner Israel realizes that, the sooner they might taste peace. And your attempt to quote \"International Law\" is interesting. How about the international law that you should not murder civilians with a military force? Or the international law that you should not force people from their homes? But, rationalizing the murdering of children, who should be going to schools rather than living as refugees and having no other options but to fight their inhumane oppressors, WHO BLEW UP THEIR SCHOOLS, is another example of how good you are at blaming your victims for their own abuse.

Furthermore, if you shoot from the school, i am going to bomb the school and turn it into pile of rubble. Living shields do not work. All this is said from my experience in Gaza strip. As it happens, you AGAIN miss the point. If we are justified in our reaction, than its level is irrelevant. If we are unjustified with our reaction, than its level is still irrelevant. I consider daily murder attempts (Quassam launches) a casus belly (sp?), and consider IDF response to be a correct one. You ignore some facts, DGS. For example we warn before we bomb. Why do not YOU suggest a tactic that will allow IDF to do its task in more humane way? Edit- Oh, i almost forgot. Under International law we are NOT required to provide Palestinians with anything at all. We ARE required to allow the aid to reach Gaza, but we CAN (according to the law) withhold it if we think that it will reach the hands of the enemy combatants. Since that it already happened several times, we can do WHATEVER we like, in FULL ACCORDANCE with the International Law. And as to your wonder why Palestinian kids are dead, look at the Pillow Kids. PK=\"Palestinian children killed by Hamas, or sent to their deaths by Hamas, in order to create international pressure on Israel\". Besides, Hamas booby-trapped its schools. When the booby-trap goes off, someone dies.",

        "reply": "Doug, the vast majority of dead were enemy combatants. This includes \"children\" as well. In my book 10 year old kid with an RPG that penetrates my tank is an enemy combatant and should be killed ASAP. The same can be said about pillow kids.

The way to resolve a \"combatant\" who is inside a school with children and other civilians also inside is to: evacuate the children / civilians, then engage the armed \"combatant(s)\". The organized Israeli Army solution is to blow up the whole building, with both civilians and combatant(s). How very noble of you. WOW, what a tough, proud, honorable military you have there. Perhaps you should ask yourself, \"would the Americans do this?\" And your response is an example of why the conflict in Israel has lasted so many decades. The Israelis commit an injustice. Like displacing / evicting a whole village into refugees. Then those victim(s) react with violence. Then the Israelis kill a whole neighborhood to respond. Then the victims respond with violence. And on, and on, and on.... Do you see an end to this cycle? Unless you can kill everyone, there is no end. OR you could stop the injustices, beginning with the \"right to return\". People will obviously fight for their homes and land. Just because you stole it, or you developed it, or the British said they wouldn't mind, does NOT MAKE IT YOURS. Either pay for it, or let them have it back. Anything else is just plain wrong, and will not lead to peace. In the mean time, blockading people into starvation will not make them peaceful neighbors either. Only justice will. The sooner Israel realizes that, the sooner they might taste peace. And your attempt to quote \"International Law\" is interesting. How about the international law that you should not murder civilians with a military force? Or the international law that you should not force people from their homes? But, rationalizing the murdering of children, who should be going to schools rather than living as refugees and having no other options but to fight their inhumane oppressors, WHO BLEW UP THEIR SCHOOLS, is another example of how good you are at blaming your victims for their own abuse. Do you beat your wife too? That must be her fault too. Sick, very sick. This message has been edited. Last edited by: DougSabbag, Tue 03 March 2009 07:37 PM",
