Uh, am I the only person that sees a double standard there? Don't judge me on my race or heritage except on this day, and then you can applaud me for it... Who else is entitled to a \"special day?\" How about we separate the combat veterans from those that didn't deploy? Or line units from REMF staff weenies? Or a national day for officers and another national day for enlisted? How about a special day just for parents? After all, don't they deserve special recognition for being both a soldier and a parent? While we're at it, how about an Army day? Oh, and a civilian DOD day! And an \"I once made something for the military\" inventor's day? Maybe the outstanding NCO's should have their own day? A Navy SEAL day, an Army Ranger day, a Coastie Parajumper day... For crying out loud, people, grow the hell up. We're the military. We're. As in WE ARE. There ain't no blacks or Indians or whites or Mexicans or Christians... we're a team. No one veteran is more deserving of their own little \"look at meeeeeeee!\" day than their brother or sister in uniform next to them. The Air Force cook is no less important than the Navy SEAL that is no less important than the Marine JAG lawyer that is no less import than the 11 bullet stopper in the Army. Keep the racism where it belongs: in the civilian sector. Veterans bleed the same color. If you can't see that, you don't deserve to wear the friggen uniform. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
