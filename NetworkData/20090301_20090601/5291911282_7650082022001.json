Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading.

What's even more despicable about treating a new member that way, was her Pro-American and Pro-Military stance.

It's just too bad we have some members who always seem to take the low road instead of the high road. No new member deserves that treatment, in particular any new foreign members who join this site. No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

The trolls have always been and always will be a chew toy for us. But here is the other side of it. Too many new people are being badgered or just jumped on by the posters here. I know that we can tell a lot of the time if they are trolls, but some have been way off the mark lately. Please do not jump on the posters and help them as you would have liked help when you were knew to here. We have the wire thread to post beliefs about a possible troll. We have the other threads that are posted on every hour to use to let others know that you belief a troll in the wire. Please contact me or another Moderator and we will handle it. I don't want people suspended for disruptive posting, ya that one, or for posting to the poster and not the post. I know you all understand and we will still have lots of fun here. Anyone? This is a timely post. I did not appreciate being called a troll. And I note that blaine68 has not returned to this site after the japing he took as a new member. That is too bad because another poster and I (officers) tried truly to give him some help. I was even called out for recommending two books to him as being off topic. I originally made a direct response to blaine68 but got an offensive jape from an E-7 or an E-8 who thought because of his rank and service, he was entitled to refer to me as a youngster. Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning? Well LT, you make some very good points, and at times, we do get a little harsh. But if you have seen some of the posers and pot stirrers that have prevaded this site in years past, you'd understand our jaded behavior. Not saying it's right per se, but it has gotten tiresome. And some people are just jerks too,lol. Either way, don't let it scare you off the site, because it is good,and there's alot of good people on here. Just stay away from that billdawg guy, and you'll be fine,",

I know that we can tell a lot of the time if they are trolls, but some have been way off the mark lately. Please do not jump on the posters and help them as you would have liked help when you were knew to here. We have the wire thread to post beliefs about a possible troll.

I don't want people suspended for disruptive posting, ya that one, or for posting to the poster and not the post. I know you all understand and we will still have lots of fun here. Anyone? This is a timely post. I did not appreciate being called a troll. And I note that blaine68 has not returned to this site after the japing he took as a new member. That is too bad because another poster and I (officers) tried truly to give him some help. I was even called out for recommending two books to him as being off topic. I originally made a direct response to blaine68 but got an offensive jape from an E-7 or an E-8 who thought because of his rank and service, he was entitled to refer to me as a youngster. Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning?",

Dawg, you probably remember a female member awhile back named Virginie (spelling?) who was in the French Army.

As a foreign member and not understanding English very well, she took that insult very personal. It's my understanding she left this site due to that incident. What's even more despicable about treating a new member that way, was her Pro-American and Pro-Military stance.

Dawg, you probably remember a female member awhile back named Virginie (spelling?) who was in the French Army. Have not seen her in quite some time, but I remember she was insulted by another member who told her to go back to her own country. As a foreign member and not understanding English very well, she took that insult very personal. It's my understanding she left this site due to that incident. What's even more despicable about treating a new member that way, was her Pro-American and Pro-Military stance. It's just too bad we have some members who always seem to take the low road instead of the high road. No new member deserves that treatment, in particular any new foreign members who join this site. No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

This is a timely post. I did not appreciate being called a troll. And I note that blaine68 has not returned to this site after the japing he took as a new member. That is too bad because another poster and I (officers) tried truly to give him some help. I was even called out for recommending two books to him as being off topic. I originally made a direct response to blaine68 but got an offensive jape from an E-7 or an E-8 who thought because of his rank and service, he was entitled to refer to me as a youngster. Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning? Well LT, you make some very good points, and at times, we do get a little harsh. But if you have seen some of the posers and pot stirrers that have prevaded this site in years past, you'd understand our jaded behavior. Not saying it's right per se, but it has gotten tiresome. And some people are just jerks too,lol. Either way, don't let it scare you off the site, because it is good,and there's alot of good people on here.

I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading.

This is a timely post. I did not appreciate being called a troll. And I note that blaine68 has not returned to this site after the japing he took as a new member. That is too bad because another poster and I (officers) tried truly to give him some help. I was even called out for recommending two books to him as being off topic. I originally made a direct response to blaine68 but got an offensive jape from an E-7 or an E-8 who thought because of his rank and service, he was entitled to refer to me as a youngster. Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning?", 
        "reply": " Well LT, you make some very good points, and at times, we do get a little harsh. But if you have seen some of the posers and pot stirrers that have prevaded this site in years past, you'd understand our jaded behavior. Not saying it's right per se, but it has gotten tiresome. And some people are just jerks too,lol. Either way, don't let it scare you off the site, because it is good,and there's alot of good people on here. Just stay away from that billdawg guy, and you'll be fine,",

The trolls have always been and always will be a chew toy for us. But here is the other side of it. Too many new people are being badgered or just jumped on by the posters here. I know that we can tell a lot of the time if they are trolls, but some have been way off the mark lately. Please do not jump on the posters and help them as you would have liked help when you were knew to here. We have the wire thread to post beliefs about a possible troll. We have the other threads that are posted on every hour to use to let others know that you belief a troll in the wire. Please contact me or another Moderator and we will handle it. I don't want people suspended for disruptive posting, ya that one, or for posting to the poster and not the post. I know you all understand and we will still have lots of fun here. Anyone? This is a timely post. I did not appreciate being called a troll. And I note that blaine68 has not returned to this site after the japing he took as a new member. That is too bad because another poster and I (officers) tried truly to give him some help. I was even called out for recommending two books to him as being off topic. I originally made a direct response to blaine68 but got an offensive jape from an E-7 or an E-8 who thought because of his rank and service, he was entitled to refer to me as a youngster. Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning? Well LT, you make some very good points, and at times, we do get a little harsh. But if you have seen some of the posers and pot stirrers that have prevaded this site in years past, you'd understand our jaded behavior. Not saying it's right per se, but it has gotten tiresome. And some people are just jerks too,lol. Either way, don't let it scare you off the site, because it is good,and there's alot of good people on here. Just stay away from that billdawg guy, and you'll be fine,",

I originally made a direct response to blaine68 but got an offensive jape from an E-7 or an E-8 who thought because of his rank and service, he was entitled to refer to me as a youngster. Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning?",

Please do not jump on the posters and help them as you would have liked help when you were knew to here. We have the wire thread to post beliefs about a possible troll. We have the other threads that are posted on every hour to use to let others know that you belief a troll in the wire. Please contact me or another Moderator and we will handle it. I don't want people suspended for disruptive posting, ya that one, or for posting to the poster and not the post. I know you all understand and we will still have lots of fun here. Anyone? Dawg, you probably remember a female member awhile back named Virginie (spelling?) who was in the French Army. Have not seen her in quite some time, but I remember she was insulted by another member who told her to go back to her own country. As a foreign member and not understanding English very well, she took that insult very personal. It's my understanding she left this site due to that incident. What's even more despicable about treating a new member that way, was her Pro-American and Pro-Military stance. It's just too bad we have some members who always seem to take the low road instead of the high road. No new member deserves that treatment, in particular any new foreign members who join this site. No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

This is a timely post. I did not appreciate being called a troll. And I note that blaine68 has not returned to this site after the japing he took as a new member. That is too bad because another poster and I (officers) tried truly to give him some help. I was even called out for recommending two books to him as being off topic. I originally made a direct response to blaine68 but got an offensive jape from an E-7 or an E-8 who thought because of his rank and service, he was entitled to refer to me as a youngster. Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning? Well LT, you make some very good points, and at times, we do get a little harsh. But if you have seen some of the posers and pot stirrers that have prevaded this site in years past, you'd understand our jaded behavior. Not saying it's right per se, but it has gotten tiresome. And some people are just jerks too,lol. Either way, don't let it scare you off the site, because it is good,and there's alot of good people on here. Just stay away from that billdawg guy, and you'll be fine,",

This is a timely post. I did not appreciate being called a troll. And I note that blaine68 has not returned to this site after the japing he took as a new member. That is too bad because another poster and I (officers) tried truly to give him some help. I was even called out for recommending two books to him as being off topic.

I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off.

I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading.

Well LT, you make some very good points, and at times, we do get a little harsh. But if you have seen some of the posers and pot stirrers that have prevaded this site in years past, you'd understand our jaded behavior. Not saying it's right per se, but it has gotten tiresome. And some people are just jerks too,lol. Either way, don't let it scare you off the site, because it is good,and there's alot of good people on here.

Never mind that I am probably older than or as old as he is, it was full japing ahead. And never mind that I might be as experienced as or more experienced than he, full japing ahead. blaine68 may or may not ever return to this site. I know I was tempted not to return but decided I was not going to let any cabal run me off. What triggered my original responses was the offensive response in the form of a dancing cartoon and a \"yeehaw\" because I gave my educational background. I strongly suspect it was more about my rank because I know how sergeants like to get on new lieutenants as ninety days wonders. Rest assured that I was educated about this and when I went on active duty, I relied heavily on my sergeants. I let them run the platoon, but I did the leading. When I left active duty, I was just short of being promoted to captain. It is too bad about blaine68, but who can blame him for not returning?", 
        "reply": " Well LT, you make some very good points, and at times, we do get a little harsh. But if you have seen some of the posers and pot stirrers that have prevaded this site in years past, you'd understand our jaded behavior. Not saying it's right per se, but it has gotten tiresome. And some people are just jerks too,lol. Either way, don't let it scare you off the site, because it is good,and there's alot of good people on here. Just stay away from that billdawg guy, and you'll be fine,",
