The United States military has, to the best of my knowledge, always recruited non US citizens. While a member of the US Coast Guard I served with quite a number of citizens of the Philippians and Samoa. In the US Army I served with Australian and British nationals. This has been the pattern throughout US history, so what\u2019s new?",

I suggest we contract out 100% of our military to Ugandans. I hear they work for as little as $700 a month, and it's working so well in Iraq.",
