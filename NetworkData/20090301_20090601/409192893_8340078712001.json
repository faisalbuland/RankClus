        "content": "In 1941 America was firmly on the side of the Allies. \"Neutrality of thought is an entirley different matter than neutrality of policy.\" FDR-Sep 1939 There were detractors, and a few were high placed but they were the minority. By May of 1941 the US had pledged 37 billion dollars in aid/armaments to the Allies. The Neutrality Act of 1939 actually repealed the prohibition of US weapons sales to belligerents enacted in 1936. William Allen White, editor of the Emporia Kansas Gazette founded the Committee To Defend America By Aiding The Allies. He wrote to FDR and told him, \"Let me tell you as an old friend you may not be able to lead the American people unless you catch up with them.\" This cleary indicated where America's sympathies lay in 1940. \"We cannot afford to become a lone Island in a world dominated by a philosophy of force.\" FDR-June 10, 1940 He then promised to extend to \"the opponents of force\" the material resouces of this nation. On July 29 1940, FDR extends US protection over all of South/Latin America barring Germany from occupying the Dutch and French colonies there. Shortly after that in AUG 1940 the US pooled defenses with Canada who were already at war with Germany. In September 1940, FDR initiated the draft and called up the entire National Guard...over 800,000 men a full year before entering into hostilities. He then transferred 50 destroyers to Britain in exchange for 99 year leases on bases in the New World. FDR's Republican opponent in the November election also promised to \"Outdistance Hitler in any contest he chooses\" and ran on a platform of \"Preparedness and Peace\". The core values of both men, who were pro-British, were so similar America elected not to change its horse midstream and wisely re-elected FDR. By March 1941, Lend Lease HR 1776, had been passed. The president of the University of Chicago called it national suicide. Churchill spoke to America in the debates over HR 1776 and it is deemed that his words were instrumental in getting Lend Lease passed. By May 1941, the US was sharing defense and intelligence plans with Britain, and British RAF pilots were training in America and training American pilots as well. By this time as well, in early to mid 1941, US Navy destroyers and escorts were tangling with U-Boats in the Western Atlantic. (See \"USS Reuben James\") The US was already at \"war\" realistically when the Germans invaded Russia in the summer of 1941. We were already \"fighting\" against the Germans while the Soviets enjoyed a non-aggression pact with Germany and Japan. On July 25th 1941, FDR's primary diplomat in London cabled him this message: \"I am wondering whether you think it importan and useful to go to Moscow. Air transportation can be there in 24 hours. I have a feeling that everything possible should be done to make certain the Russians maintain a permanent front even though they be defeated in this immediate battle.\" FDR sent him. With this message for Stalin: \"Mr Hopkins is in Moscow at my request for discussion with you personally the vitally important question of how we can most expeditiously and effectively make available the assistance which the United States can render to your country in its magnificent resistance to the treacherous aggression of Hitlerite Germany.\" America's attitude toward Russia public and offical policy-wise shifted dramatically. Before Operation Barbarossa, Russia was \"that country\" that had bullied Finland, and helped Germany invade Poland. Now, even though the US was not at war, the majority of Americans viewed them as a welcome ally. In part because they shocked that Germany would feel still confident enough to tackle them. Americans were also gratified to hear that the Soviet Union was not falling so quickly and easily as had the other nations of Europe.",
