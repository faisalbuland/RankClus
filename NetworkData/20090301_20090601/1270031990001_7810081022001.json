        "content": "Blessed Ostara! This ancient holiday was once called \u0112ostre (also \u0112astre) in Old English, and \u00d4star\u00e2 in German. It celebrates the return of Spring. This celebration is traditionally held on the first full moon after the spring equinox, as this is traditionally a LUNAR month, not a Solar month. This is why the date is marked by the moon cycle, not the equinox. It is also the precise reason why the modern Easter celebration is held on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox. (Easter is merely a Pagan holiday that was usurped by the Catholic church.) The Goddess Ostara (who may be merged from multiple traditions, and is known by several similar names from various languages) is known as the harbinger of the Sun. It is she who announces the rebirth of life in the Spring and holds the promise of new beginnings and summer growth. Ostara is a Goddess of fertility, rebirth, agriculture, purification, and health and healing Eggs were symbols of fertility, and were decorated and given as gifts in baskets made to resemble birds' nests. Rabbits and hares are symbols of fertility, and were considered sacred to Ostara. By tradition, Ostara is often pictured as having a rabbit's head or ears. The Easter Bunny and Easter Egg are absolutely Pagan symbols. But wait! This celebration traces even further back to the story of the Goddess Inanna (Ishtar), from whom the original \"Easter\" story comes. It's the ancient Sumerian story of 'Inanna's Descent to the Underworld'. According to the myth, the goddess plans to visit the underworld ruled by her dark sister Ereshkigal. After dressing in jewels and fine clothing, Inanna descends and is met by Ereshkigal\u2019s servant, who at each of the seven gates to the underworld removes one of her garments. Finally she approaches her sister naked and humiliated. An angry Ereshkigal orders that she be killed and hangs her body on a peg to rot. After three days Inanna's servant becomes worried by her absence and fashions little creatures who descend unseen to the underworld with materials to breathe life back into the goddess. They resurrect her and she reascends to heaven. Sounds a bit familiar, doesn't it? As Ishtar descended, she was stripped and humiliated; according to the Bible mythos, Jesus was stripped, beaten and humbled. Ishtar was killed and hung on a stake; Jesus was hung on a cross. Ishtar was resurrected after three days; Jesus rose from the dead on the third day. Both achieved eternal life. Easter is in fact the same story as Ishtar. Easter is the celebration of an ancient Pagan holiday. Different cultures throughout history added their own minor twists, but the origin of the holiday remains the same. This is an ancient lunar Pagan holiday, which celebrates fertility, rebirth, and the return of spring. A joyful time indeed! It warms my heart to see so many people across the nation celebrating old pagan traditions such as egg coloring and egg hunts. Blessed Ostara!",

Nobody gives a hooey about Easter being an ode to some goblin, it isn't. That's your psychosis believing we're all celebrating your witches. Paganism is satan's attempt to destroy catholicism. Catholics have folded in many ways to satan's charms, but they, like every individual with free-will do not represent the Words of God, only the Words and our Lord, Jesus Christ. He is your Lord, whether you recognize it or not. Show me where the flying monsters or trolls of your faith have a time-tested book from their supreme, or anything that matches the facts of the life of Jesus and the miracles He performed. The Bible has over 300 prophecies of the coming of Christ, it is easier to have someone elses fingerprint than to fulfill those prophesies. The romans knew they had killed the Messiah after His final breath. The earth shook and became dark at that moment. So again, you heart is warmed because why? It's not because we celebrate Easter it's because you think the masses are being decieved into celbrating something they are not, and to a certain extent it's true about your vile paganistic ceremony, but deception shouldn't warm you, you should advocate change, so that those that follow your sick rituals know they are flirting with the fate of their souls.

        "content": "Blessed Ostara! This ancient holiday was once called \u0112ostre (also \u0112astre) in Old English, and \u00d4star\u00e2 in German. It celebrates the return of Spring. This celebration is traditionally held on the first full moon after the spring equinox, as this is traditionally a LUNAR month, not a Solar month. This is why the date is marked by the moon cycle, not the equinox. It is also the precise reason why the modern Easter celebration is held on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox. (Easter is merely a Pagan holiday that was usurped by the Catholic church.) The Goddess Ostara (who may be merged from multiple traditions, and is known by several similar names from various languages) is known as the harbinger of the Sun. It is she who announces the rebirth of life in the Spring and holds the promise of new beginnings and summer growth. Ostara is a Goddess of fertility, rebirth, agriculture, purification, and health and healing Eggs were symbols of fertility, and were decorated and given as gifts in baskets made to resemble birds' nests. Rabbits and hares are symbols of fertility, and were considered sacred to Ostara. By tradition, Ostara is often pictured as having a rabbit's head or ears. The Easter Bunny and Easter Egg are absolutely Pagan symbols. But wait! This celebration traces even further back to the story of the Goddess Inanna (Ishtar), from whom the original \"Easter\" story comes. It's the ancient Sumerian story of 'Inanna's Descent to the Underworld'. According to the myth, the goddess plans to visit the underworld ruled by her dark sister Ereshkigal. After dressing in jewels and fine clothing, Inanna descends and is met by Ereshkigal\u2019s servant, who at each of the seven gates to the underworld removes one of her garments. Finally she approaches her sister naked and humiliated. An angry Ereshkigal orders that she be killed and hangs her body on a peg to rot. After three days Inanna's servant becomes worried by her absence and fashions little creatures who descend unseen to the underworld with materials to breathe life back into the goddess. They resurrect her and she reascends to heaven. Sounds a bit familiar, doesn't it? As Ishtar descended, she was stripped and humiliated; according to the Bible mythos, Jesus was stripped, beaten and humbled. Ishtar was killed and hung on a stake; Jesus was hung on a cross. Ishtar was resurrected after three days; Jesus rose from the dead on the third day. Both achieved eternal life. Easter is in fact the same story as Ishtar. Easter is the celebration of an ancient Pagan holiday. Different cultures throughout history added their own minor twists, but the origin of the holiday remains the same. This is an ancient lunar Pagan holiday, which celebrates fertility, rebirth, and the return of spring. A joyful time indeed! It warms my heart to see so many people across the nation celebrating old pagan traditions such as egg coloring and egg hunts. Blessed Ostara!",

        "reply": "Blessed Ostara! This ancient holiday was once called \u0112ostre (also \u0112astre) in Old English, and \u00d4star\u00e2 in German. It celebrates the return of Spring. This celebration is traditionally held on the first full moon after the spring equinox, as this is traditionally a LUNAR month, not a Solar month. This is why the date is marked by the moon cycle, not the equinox. It is also the precise reason why the modern Easter celebration is held on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox. (Easter is merely a Pagan holiday that was usurped by the Catholic church.) The Goddess Ostara (who may be merged from multiple traditions, and is known by several similar names from various languages) is known as the harbinger of the Sun. It is she who announces the rebirth of life in the Spring and holds the promise of new beginnings and summer growth. Ostara is a Goddess of fertility, rebirth, agriculture, purification, and health and healing Eggs were symbols of fertility, and were decorated and given as gifts in baskets made to resemble birds' nests.

He is your Lord, whether you recognize it or not. Show me where the flying monsters or trolls of your faith have a time-tested book from their supreme, or anything that matches the facts of the life of Jesus and the miracles He performed. The Bible has over 300 prophecies of the coming of Christ, it is easier to have someone elses fingerprint than to fulfill those prophesies. The romans knew they had killed the Messiah after His final breath. The earth shook and became dark at that moment. So again, you heart is warmed because why? It's not because we celebrate Easter it's because you think the masses are being decieved into celbrating something they are not, and to a certain extent it's true about your vile paganistic ceremony, but deception shouldn't warm you, you should advocate change, so that those that follow your sick rituals know they are flirting with the fate of their souls.
