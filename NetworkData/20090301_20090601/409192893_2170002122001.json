Death penalties are rarely enforced and Vehemently objected to by many. penetentiarys have become resorts and learning centers for the beginners so they are really no longer a deterrent. most offenders are caree criminals, sex offenders are put back on the streets time and time again. Its a drain on society yet something has to be done. What? How about some real deterrents to crime? Since they dont fear the system in place give them something to fear. Why not just disable them? To barbaric? Not if you think of the impact of thier crimes on the victims and thier families. How much crime could a blind man accomplish? Second offenders lose thier hearing, Now that would slow them down and put the burden on thier families. And no disability payments either. That would sure as hell deter me. Thieves lose fingers and hands, Rapists lose you know what. Let the penalty fit the crime. Lobodomys are another option. Im sure there are a million ways to deter crime. The problem is the penal system is more focused on rehabilitating these losers into useful citizens and thats been a complete failure and a burden on society.",
