Afghanistan has no economic Strategic value except for rugs and dope, so building an \"infrastructure\" there is less important to us than eliminating the training ground for the Enemy. 3.

Instead of aligning ourselves with the secular forces of Afghanistan (and there are plenty of them, from Right Wing Monarchists, to Socialists and Communists) we choose to support \"tame\" Islamic Fundamentalists, and dope dealing warlords - Neither of whom have the faintest interest in our success; both of whom will stab us in the back in a heartbeat.

There's little to choose between them and the real Taliban - And the dope dealers will simply sign on with the Taliban as long as they can continue selling drugs, and off to Europe with their loot if things get tight. The question of the safe havens in Pakistan is a serious one. But it wouldn't even exist if we had picked the right people the first time around. As long as THIS new administration continues its support for these time tested failed leaders, Pakistan is almost an academic question. As for your other point - Don't be so sure that Iran has any interest in helping Al Qaeda - This is 100 percent incorrect. Nothing would please the Iranians more then Al Qaeda disappearing from the face of the earth - And the same is true of their buddies in Lebanon. We stopped Iran from going to war with Afghanistan years ago - Bright move, wouldn't you say? Look, we need at least the \"tacit\" cooperation of the world in order to eliminate the last vestiges of this heretical sect of Islam. We wont get it by playing to the script of Al Qaeda.

Take Al Qaeda away from Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and western Pakistan, and they all still formed a large bloc of nations which supported physical Violence against us and our Allies and Propaganda against us. Now put Al Qaeda back, and you'll find that ALL of the above entities rejoiced at 9-11 and similar events, that Al Qaeda gets it recruits and even much finance from most of them and from Saudi Arabia and \"Palestine\" and Lebanon, and that everybody knows that Al Qaeda ALSO causes trouble against their internal governments periodically in an attempt to take them over, especially when they don't follow Al Qaeda's exact line and try to play footsie with the West. 2. The German destruction of USA shipping. That's your out-of-context issue, because it wasn't enough to enable or cause Roosevelt to enter WWII, although he did send arms and material to help the U.K. Blocking Roosevelt's perceptions and thinking were his own playboy preoccupations similar to Clinton's, an enormous pro-Nazi and/or Anti-British news media and factions in the USA including a big faction still hating the U.K. for mistreating Ireland in the early 1900s and 1800s, and a big isolationist faction which didn't regard attacks on ships as an act of War, not to mention the Marxists who at that time were supporting the USSR's deal with Hitler.

The Shah was the Monarch of the land way before Truman and Ike gave permission for the OSS to work with MI6. I've published the CIA report a number of times explaining how the plans of the two spy outfits fell flat on their face and only the prematured published newspaper stating the Shah's dethronement counteracted the GD Commie conspiracy. Mossedeq counted his chickens before they were hatched. There was no military from either the Brits or Americans in the country. How could we re-install him when he was never un-installed? Mossedeq that you keep saying was the democratic elected leader got all of 50% of the Majlis, which is doodily squat. The Iranian military that favored the Shah at the time was imprisoned, executed, and only by the grace of the early edition of Tass did the people understand what in the sam hell was going on. The military under Mossedeq reneged on firing on the people and the Shah was installed back to his rightful throne. Now that's a hell of a lot more interesting than your bs that's only substaniated by Tehran. I've also ask exactly which aircraft were involved in the sinking of the Iranian ships. Over 700 ships were sunk in the tanker wars. BTW my son spent much of his Naval duty blowing up mines and escort duties in the Gulf on the USS R K Turner. It was a dangerous theater to be in. Their only direct hostilities was from two Iraqi aircraft that was forced to break off their attack. I guess you've never read that Antrax is a two way street. It also is used to vaccinate animals. The rest of the bug juice you can purchase at Home Depot. NONE was never ever used as a weapon! Yeah, the intell came in handy. Saddam the great warrior would have lost at least the southern part of the Tigris and Euphartes Rivers and quite possible Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. You do recall the Persians were lobbing missles into Kuwait at the time? Other than killing our fellow citizens and Marines, our Embassy employees, 72 French Marines and over 12,000 of their own military trained in the west, they are just a bunch of beloved wonderful people.

WWII Iran was defeated by the Russians from the North and Brits from the south after they declared Axis relations. WWII Saudi Arabia signs contract and treaty with FDR. Having no relations with Germany. All toll Germany suffers at the pump and relies on coal conversion for fuel. Big deal for the allies. Dave Iran took our Iranian Embassy. That is a direct attack on our soil and sovereignty. Iran proxies killed 241 Marines in Lebanon. Iran proxies took hostages, killed the CIA director, hang Lt Colonel Higgins, and brutaly beat Seaman Stethem to death, and I hope you consider that Hizbullah and Hamas are directly infringing on and attacking our allies. Another observation. Everyone downgrades the US for not accepting reality and entering the war much earlier. Number one, as reminded on the forum just today that Americans have the freedom of expession and all sides were deeply trouble with yet another war in Europe. With FDR funneling millions of supplies to the Brits our Congress was on his back demanded something in return. As in WWI our efforts were never repayed. The population was seeing deja vu all over again. Lend lease went into effect and lasted like two months before we actually jump into the war with both feet.

        "reply": "There was no such animal as Pakistan in the years 1941 through 48. Gained independence once the Brits left India. One to two \"Indians\" million perished in the genocide and displacement process. WWII Iraq was defeated by the British RAF, they were distined to followed Syria into the Nazi camp. WWII Iran was defeated by the Russians from the North and Brits from the south after they declared Axis relations. WWII Saudi Arabia signs contract and treaty with FDR. Having no relations with Germany. All toll Germany suffers at the pump and relies on coal conversion for fuel. Big deal for the allies. Dave Iran took our Iranian Embassy. That is a direct attack on our soil and sovereignty. Iran proxies killed 241 Marines in Lebanon. Iran proxies took hostages, killed the CIA director, hang Lt Colonel Higgins, and brutaly beat Seaman Stethem to death, and I hope you consider that Hizbullah and Hamas are directly infringing on and attacking our allies. Another observation. Everyone downgrades the US for not accepting reality and entering the war much earlier. Number one, as reminded on the forum just today that Americans have the freedom of expession and all sides were deeply trouble with yet another war in Europe. With FDR funneling millions of supplies to the Brits our Congress was on his back demanded something in return. As in WWI our efforts were never repayed. The population was seeing deja vu all over again. Lend lease went into effect and lasted like two months before we actually jump into the war with both feet.

We can start to rectify this mess by dumping Karzai and company and push for a Secular Afghanistan. Dave",

Dave You've commented on this before, and before I extented an invite to enlighten this old fart where this information comes from other than the publications and propaganda of the Cleric's. This keen hatred is needed because, a revolution without someone to hate is just not a revolution. The Shah was the Monarch of the land way before Truman and Ike gave permission for the OSS to work with MI6. I've published the CIA report a number of times explaining how the plans of the two spy outfits fell flat on their face and only the prematured published newspaper stating the Shah's dethronement counteracted the GD Commie conspiracy. Mossedeq counted his chickens before they were hatched. There was no military from either the Brits or Americans in the country. How could we re-install him when he was never un-installed? Mossedeq that you keep saying was the democratic elected leader got all of 50% of the Majlis, which is doodily squat. The Iranian military that favored the Shah at the time was imprisoned, executed, and only by the grace of the early edition of Tass did the people understand what in the sam hell was going on. The military under Mossedeq reneged on firing on the people and the Shah was installed back to his rightful throne. Now that's a hell of a lot more interesting than your bs that's only substaniated by Tehran. I've also ask exactly which aircraft were involved in the sinking of the Iranian ships. Over 700 ships were sunk in the tanker wars. BTW my son spent much of his Naval duty blowing up mines and escort duties in the Gulf on the USS R K Turner. It was a dangerous theater to be in. Their only direct hostilities was from two Iraqi aircraft that was forced to break off their attack. I guess you've never read that Antrax is a two way street. It also is used to vaccinate animals. The rest of the bug juice you can purchase at Home Depot. NONE was never ever used as a weapon! Yeah, the intell came in handy. Saddam the great warrior would have lost at least the southern part of the Tigris and Euphartes Rivers and quite possible Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. You do recall the Persians were lobbing missles into Kuwait at the time? Other than killing our fellow citizens and Marines, our Embassy employees, 72 French Marines and over 12,000 of their own military trained in the west, they are just a bunch of beloved wonderful people. Here's a easy one. give me a list from one to ten of the freedoms Iranians enjoy.",
