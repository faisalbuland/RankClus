        "content": "At the VA there is a sign which reads \"The Price Of Freedom Is Visible Here\". When I returned from Iraq (Adviser Team 6000) in 2007 I read about a program at Walter Reed Army Hospital teaching our wounded veterans to SCUBA Dive. Long Story Short, the Disabled Veterans SCUBA Project (see DisabledVeteransScubaProject.org for more information) was born February 25, 2009 and currently has approval to teach paraplegic and quadriplegic veterans at the Long Beach CA Veterans Hospital and PTSD, TBI, Poly-Trauma, and Blind Veterans at the West Los Angeles VA to SCUBA Dive. This is an opportunity to give to those who have given so much. SCUBA Diving offers a chance to leave the wheelchair behind for a while and enjoy participating in a sport with your friends flying through the water. This program is a way to say thank you not only to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans but those from Vietnam as well. We are not alone, there are programs in Tennessee, New Mexico, Texas, and Walter Reed. Want to help? While the members of the Disabled Veterans SCUBA Program are all unpaid volunteers, the cost of a pool, equipment and dive boats etc, necessary to run the program is over $1,400 per student. We are just starting out and until the corporate sponsors step up to the plate, well, we could use some help. We do not use professional fund raisers, every penny goes to the project.
