I know in the submarine service we had a great deal more respect for officers that were prior enlisted. Not to mean other officers were not respected or anything like that, but there were many times a new officer right out of college would say to do \"X\", and we would turn and look at our chief and LPO first... I reccomend enlisting for atleast one term, you get to see how things work on that side, which will make you a better officer if you latter decide to go to OCS or one of the various enlisted to officer programs. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake.
