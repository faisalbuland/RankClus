Both Dodd and the official, who asked not to be named, said it was because administration officials were afraid the government would face numerous lawsuits without the new language. Dodd, a Democrat, told CNN's Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer that Obama administration officials pushed for the language to an amendment designed to limit bonuses and \"golden parachutes\" at those companies. \"The administration had expressed reservations,\" Dodd said. \"They asked for modifications. The alternative was losing the amendment entirely.\" On Tuesday, Dodd denied to CNN that he had anything to do with adding the language, which has been used by officials at bailed-out insurance giant AIG to justify paying millions of dollars in bonuses to executives after receiving federal money. He said Wednesday that the \"grandfather clause\" language \"seemed like innocent modifications\" at the time. <more> \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/18/aig.bonuses.congress/index.html\" It seems that Fox, Drudge, and Limbaugh, among others, were right on the money afterall. I can think of a few liberal web sites that have been castigating them for erroneous reporting based on Dodd's denial yesterday that must be feeling pretty embarassed about now. Dodd should resign.

Dodd acknowledged his role in the change after a Treasury Department official told CNN the administration pushed for the language. Both Dodd and the official, who asked not to be named, said it was because administration officials were afraid the government would face numerous lawsuits without the new language. Dodd, a Democrat, told CNN's Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer that Obama administration officials pushed for the language to an amendment designed to limit bonuses and \"golden parachutes\" at those companies. \"The administration had expressed reservations,\" Dodd said. \"They asked for modifications. The alternative was losing the amendment entirely.\" On Tuesday, Dodd denied to CNN that he had anything to do with adding the language, which has been used by officials at bailed-out insurance giant AIG to justify paying millions of dollars in bonuses to executives after receiving federal money. He said Wednesday that the \"grandfather clause\" language \"seemed like innocent modifications\" at the time. <more> \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/18/aig.bonuses.congress/index.html\" It seems that Fox, Drudge, and Limbaugh, among others, were right on the money afterall. I can think of a few liberal web sites that have been castigating them for erroneous reporting based on Dodd's denial yesterday that must be feeling pretty embarassed about now. Dodd should resign. It would also appear that the Obama administration was far more involved in getting the exception added than anything we've heard would lead one to believe.
