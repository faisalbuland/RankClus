In a significant shift, White House and Treasury Department officials now say they can stretch what is left of the $700 billion financial bailout fund further than they had expected a few months ago, simply by converting the government\u2019s existing loans to the nation\u2019s 19 biggest banks into common stock. Converting those loans to common shares would turn the federal aid into available capital for a bank \u2014 and give the government a large ownership stake in return. While the option appears to be a quick and easy way to avoid a confrontation with Congressional leaders wary of putting more money into the banks, some critics would consider it a back door to nationalization, since the government could become the largest shareholder in several banks.",

They are going to continue taking over businesses and destroying the founding documents until the next election. Some of the damage we can fix quickly, some we will never fix. This problem can be fixed. Oh, its gonna cost us, but it will be reversed. The things that really scare me are Obama's damning words on foreign lands. His wanting to work with dicatators and communist leaders. His lack of strenght when he's being disrespected by these morons. I wrote a letter and sent it to every swinging (idiot) @#$% in washington. The last thing I said in the letter was; \"On January 20th, Obama will begin tearing up the Constitution and the Bill of Rights\". The banks are a small step to the plan.",

Thieves stayed outside and so did the wind, and the sound of the passing freight trains softened. When I visited the Caros in January, a fire burned in an overturned oil barrel, warming the cool air, and fresh-cut Christmas tree boughs hung on the walls for decoration.
