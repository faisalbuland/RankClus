The $1.19 game - one of thousands of so-called \"apps\" that Apple sells on its iTunes App Store - was called Baby Shaker and was taken down overnight after scores of complaints. People who downloaded and played the game said the player had to shake the phone vigorously to stop the crying sound. The game ends when red crosses appear on the baby's eyes, signifying that it has died. (....) WTF! What idiot came up with this ****, and how did this get trough the approval process? +http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2009/04/23/1240079769529.html \"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\" -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
