By detecting tiny changes in brightness, telescope will seek planets comparable to our own The universe may be filled with Earth-like planets \u2014 worlds where extraterrestrials might flourish. But these planets were once considered too small to spot, even with the latest in space technology. Now, many astronomers believe NASA\u2019s $600 million Kepler telescope, which is scheduled to shoot into space this week, will help to clear up the mystery. Named for Johannes Kepler, a 17th-century German astronomer who studied planetary motion, the telescope is designed to search 100,000 stars in the Milky Way for Earth-sized rocky planets where water could flow and form streams, lakes and oceans. Some astronomers believe the spacecraft could eventually find about 50 Earth-like planets. Full story at ... >http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/6288788.html",
