By David Sirota Mar. 21, 2009 | United Steelworkers president Leo Gerard likes to say that Washington policymakers \"treat the people who take a shower after work much differently than they treat the people who shower before they go to work.\" In the 21st century Gilded Age, the blue-collar shower-after-work crowd is given the tough, while the white-collar shower-before-work gang gets the love, and never before this week was that doctrine made so clear. Following news that government-owned American International Group devoted $165 million of its $170 billion taxpayer bailout to employee bonuses, the White House insisted nothing could be done to halt the robbery. On ABC's Sunday chat show, Obama advisor Larry Summers couched his passive-aggressive defense of AIG's thieves in the saccharine argot of jurisprudence. \"We are a country of law -- there are contracts (and) the government cannot just abrogate contracts,\" he said. The rhetoric echoed John Adams' two-century-old fairy tale about an impartial \"government of laws, and not of men.\" Only now, the reassuring platitudes can't hide the uncomfortable truth. Last month, the same government that says it \"cannot just abrogate\" executives' bonus contracts used its leverage to cancel unions' wage contracts. As the Wall Street Journal reported, federal loans to G.M. and Chrysler were made contingent on those manufacturers shredding their existing labor pacts and \"extract[ing] financial concessions from workers.\" In other words, our government asks us to believe that it possesses total authority to adjust contracts at car companies it lends to, and yet has zero power to modify contracts at financial firms it owns. This, even though the latter set of covenants might be easily abolished. According to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, these allegedly inviolate AIG agreements promised bonus money the company didn't have and were crafted by executives who knew the firm was collapsing, meaning there is a decent chance these pacts could be invalidated under \"fraudulent conveyance\" statutes. They also might be canceled via \"force majeure\" clauses allowing one party to rescind a pact in the event of extraordinary circumstances -- like, perhaps, the collapse of the world economy. (Note: BusinessWeek reports that corporations are already citing the recession as reason to invoke such clauses and nix their business-to-business contracts.) But, then, those legal cases require a government that treats AIG's shower-before-work employees with the same firmness that it treats the auto industry's shower-after-work employees, not the government we currently have -- the one that believes \"the supreme sanctity of employment contracts applies only to some types of employees but not others,\" as Salon.com's Glenn Greenwald says. Mind you, this double standard works the other way, too. Congressional Republicans have long supported the laws letting bankruptcy courts annul mortgage contracts for vacation homes. Those statutes help the shower-before-work clique at least retain their beachside villas, no matter how many of their speculative Ponzi schemes go bad. But for those who shower after work, it's Adams-esque bromides against \"absolving borrowers of their personal responsibility,\" as the GOP announced it will oppose legislation permitting bankruptcy judges to revise mortgage contracts for primary residences. Certainly, for all the connotations of fairness inherent in American politics' \"country of law\" catchphrases, most of us know that the selective application of legal principles is as old as the Republic. However, lots of us are only now discovering that inequality is so pronounced that the time of day we bathe determines the enforcement and reliability (or lack thereof) of even the most basic contracts. We are just realizing that for all the parroting of America's second president, we are ruled by a government of men, and not of laws. >>>>http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/03/21/sirota/print.html Question: Are we still a country of laws?

I'd also like to know why AIG and others basically get a \"gift\" of free cash while the auto industry gets a \"loan\" Do I think it's right for these AIG execs to take these bonuses? H6LL no! I'm actually quite pizzed off about it. But I don't think it's right to come up with a retro active bill to seize another American's property either. If there was a \"criminal\" act commited by these execs then I can see them paying a \"fine\", but most simply had a contract in place already prior to receiving the bailout money. I don't think it's the Government's place to dictate what a persons' wages should be. It's bad enough we have a minimum wage, do you want a maximum wage too? Who gets to decide that? I'll put in terms you might understand. In IL the state minimum wage is $7.75 and hour. A security guard in IL is required to have 20 hrs of training to work unarmed and 40 hrs of training to work armed. This is entry level training. Most entry level security guards start at the 8-10 dollar an hour rate unarmed, 10-12 armed. Those that actually want a career in the security feild go get training, education and certifications to make them better guards. Higher the level of training, normally an increase in pay comes with it. Also the higher the risk the higher the pay. The unarmed doorman at an officer building makes less than an armed bank guard, who makes less than the armored car guard, who makes less than the special response (strike) teams, who make less than the nuclear power plant guards, who make less than the high level Executive Protection operatives, and so on. I know highly trained, certified, EP specialists that make $100.00 dollars an hour plus expenses. Dangerous work that comes with good pay. What if the stated mandated maximum wage in the security at $15.00 an hour? Is that fair? is that right? Do you think a lot of quality people are going risk their lives for that much money? Now apply this maximum wage concept to other jobs. Policemen, firemen, construction works, etc. Why should some hack in the Statehouse or Washington who has no clue on what takes be a [insert job here] decide how much that job should pay? Too much government control already, they don't need more.",

Why didn't you save enough money during the glorious years of \"Trickle down economics\"?? Some of us did. But, running a small business is extremely hard. For most, their employees make more than the owner and the owner works double the hours. Running your own business, even a successful one, is a lot harder than being an employee. You usually give yourself a small salary, just enough to pay your personal bills, so that your business has a little more in the budget. Any profit that your business makes goes right back into the business in the form of equipment, healthcare plans, HR/accounting services, leases, repairs, bonuses/raises for employees, etc. The profit is never saved because a business's requirements for future growth always outweigh whatever profits the business makes. So, the owner never gets his hand on any of those profits and the profits are always a couple years behind. Like I said, many business owners have a salary that is less than their employees. I paid my employees roughly the same salary that I made. While that salary was substantial for a time it has gone down roughly 85%. I kept my employees at the same salary for as long as I could because I could not stay competitive in my industry by lowering them. I eventually had to cut my staff in half and now I am my business's only employee. My business is just staying afloat in today's current crisis. But, if it gets worse, I will have to shut her down. Getting rid of my employees was the hardest thing out of all of this because I had finally found some really good, honest and hardworking people. And, to see their hard work be rewarded with a pink slip just made me nothing more than heartbroken. I never wish that feeling on anybody. I know that I will be alright because I have invested my money wisely, but not everybody does that. I found that out when some of my employees would call and beg for their job back, would tell me that they are being foreclosed, that their spouse is leaving them or that they are days away from being on the street. I would get a little misty afterward. But, there was nothing I could do for them. My operating budget was gone and my business could no longer sustain ANY employees. I wish people did save when they are making good money. But, it seems that people today just do not live within their means. Even when somebody is making a few hundred thousand a year, they spend it all and in some cases consume even more than they make. So, don't be so ignorant with your little quips.

I don't think it's the Government's place to dictate what a persons' wages should be. It's bad enough we have a minimum wage, do you want a maximum wage too? Who gets to decide that? I'll put in terms you might understand. In IL the state minimum wage is $7.75 and hour. A security guard in IL is required to have 20 hrs of training to work unarmed and 40 hrs of training to work armed. This is entry level training. Most entry level security guards start at the 8-10 dollar an hour rate unarmed, 10-12 armed. Those that actually want a career in the security feild go get training, education and certifications to make them better guards. Higher the level of training, normally an increase in pay comes with it. Also the higher the risk the higher the pay. The unarmed doorman at an officer building makes less than an armed bank guard, who makes less than the armored car guard, who makes less than the special response (strike) teams, who make less than the nuclear power plant guards, who make less than the high level Executive Protection operatives, and so on. I know highly trained, certified, EP specialists that make $100.00 dollars an hour plus expenses. Dangerous work that comes with good pay. What if the stated mandated maximum wage in the security at $15.00 an hour? Is that fair? is that right? Do you think a lot of quality people are going risk their lives for that much money? Now apply this maximum wage concept to other jobs. Policemen, firemen, construction works, etc. Why should some hack in the Statehouse or Washington who has no clue on what takes be a [insert job here] decide how much that job should pay? Too much government control already, they don't need more. I can tell you exactly what happened when the state of MA mandated that all of our employees received health care. Every single hourly employee lost that years raise. Every single hourly employee saw less money in his or her paycheck. College students and retired people barely able to pay for food and rent had to find ways to make do with less.. And in return? They received the worse health care plan I've ever seen. It covered next to nothing. The co-pays where out of sight. You think my company could go back to our clients ( some of whom where CONTRACTED to service levels that required us to provide 100's of people for them...) and re-coup any of that? Not a chance. You walk into some CEO's office and tell him you need to increase your fee by 15-20% and in return you're going to provide the SAME service...try spinning that. Why shouldn't a 23 or 24 year old person have the freedom of choice to decide to have a little more money in his cheek every week and for go HC? I guess liberals only support choice when it comes to killing babies.",

On ABC's Sunday chat show, Obama advisor Larry Summers couched his passive-aggressive defense of AIG's thieves in the saccharine argot of jurisprudence. \"We are a country of law -- there are contracts (and) the government cannot just abrogate contracts,\" he said. The rhetoric echoed John Adams' two-century-old fairy tale about an impartial \"government of laws, and not of men.\" Only now, the reassuring platitudes can't hide the uncomfortable truth. Last month, the same government that says it \"cannot just abrogate\" executives' bonus contracts used its leverage to cancel unions' wage contracts. As the Wall Street Journal reported, federal loans to G.M. and Chrysler were made contingent on those manufacturers shredding their existing labor pacts and \"extract[ing] financial concessions from workers.\" In other words, our government asks us to believe that it possesses total authority to adjust contracts at car companies it lends to, and yet has zero power to modify contracts at financial firms it owns. This, even though the latter set of covenants might be easily abolished. According to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, these allegedly inviolate AIG agreements promised bonus money the company didn't have and were crafted by executives who knew the firm was collapsing, meaning there is a decent chance these pacts could be invalidated under \"fraudulent conveyance\" statutes. They also might be canceled via \"force majeure\" clauses allowing one party to rescind a pact in the event of extraordinary circumstances -- like, perhaps, the collapse of the world economy. (Note: BusinessWeek reports that corporations are already citing the recession as reason to invoke such clauses and nix their business-to-business contracts.) But, then, those legal cases require a government that treats AIG's shower-before-work employees with the same firmness that it treats the auto industry's shower-after-work employees, not the government we currently have -- the one that believes \"the supreme sanctity of employment contracts applies only to some types of employees but not others,\" as Salon.com's Glenn Greenwald says.

A security guard in IL is required to have 20 hrs of training to work unarmed and 40 hrs of training to work armed. This is entry level training. Most entry level security guards start at the 8-10 dollar an hour rate unarmed, 10-12 armed. Those that actually want a career in the security feild go get training, education and certifications to make them better guards. Higher the level of training, normally an increase in pay comes with it. Also the higher the risk the higher the pay. The unarmed doorman at an officer building makes less than an armed bank guard, who makes less than the armored car guard, who makes less than the special response (strike) teams, who make less than the nuclear power plant guards, who make less than the high level Executive Protection operatives, and so on. I know highly trained, certified, EP specialists that make $100.00 dollars an hour plus expenses. Dangerous work that comes with good pay. What if the stated mandated maximum wage in the security at $15.00 an hour? Is that fair? is that right? Do you think a lot of quality people are going risk their lives for that much money? Now apply this maximum wage concept to other jobs.

I don't think it's the Government's place to dictate what a persons' wages should be. It's bad enough we have a minimum wage, do you want a maximum wage too? Who gets to decide that? I'll put in terms you might understand. In IL the state minimum wage is $7.75 and hour. A security guard in IL is required to have 20 hrs of training to work unarmed and 40 hrs of training to work armed. This is entry level training. Most entry level security guards start at the 8-10 dollar an hour rate unarmed, 10-12 armed. Those that actually want a career in the security feild go get training, education and certifications to make them better guards. Higher the level of training, normally an increase in pay comes with it. Also the higher the risk the higher the pay. The unarmed doorman at an officer building makes less than an armed bank guard, who makes less than the armored car guard, who makes less than the special response (strike) teams, who make less than the nuclear power plant guards, who make less than the high level Executive Protection operatives, and so on. I know highly trained, certified, EP specialists that make $100.00 dollars an hour plus expenses. Dangerous work that comes with good pay. What if the stated mandated maximum wage in the security at $15.00 an hour? Is that fair? is that right? Do you think a lot of quality people are going risk their lives for that much money? Now apply this maximum wage concept to other jobs. Policemen, firemen, construction works, etc. Why should some hack in the Statehouse or Washington who has no clue on what takes be a [insert job here] decide how much that job should pay? Too much government control already, they don't need more. I can tell you exactly what happened when the state of MA mandated that all of our employees received health care. Every single hourly employee lost that years raise. Every single hourly employee saw less money in his or her paycheck. College students and retired people barely able to pay for food and rent had to find ways to make do with less.. And in return? They received the worse health care plan I've ever seen. It covered next to nothing. The co-pays where out of sight. You think my company could go back to our clients ( some of whom where CONTRACTED to service levels that required us to provide 100's of people for them...) and re-coup any of that? Not a chance. You walk into some CEO's office and tell him you need to increase your fee by 15-20% and in return you're going to provide the SAME service...try spinning that. Why shouldn't a 23 or 24 year old person have the freedom of choice to decide to have a little more money in his cheek every week and for go HC?

Why didn't you save enough money during the glorious years of \"Trickle down economics\"?? Some of us did. But, running a small business is extremely hard. For most, their employees make more than the owner and the owner works double the hours. Running your own business, even a successful one, is a lot harder than being an employee. You usually give yourself a small salary, just enough to pay your personal bills, so that your business has a little more in the budget. Any profit that your business makes goes right back into the business in the form of equipment, healthcare plans, HR/accounting services, leases, repairs, bonuses/raises for employees, etc. The profit is never saved because a business's requirements for future growth always outweigh whatever profits the business makes. So, the owner never gets his hand on any of those profits and the profits are always a couple years behind. Like I said, many business owners have a salary that is less than their employees. I paid my employees roughly the same salary that I made. While that salary was substantial for a time it has gone down roughly 85%. I kept my employees at the same salary for as long as I could because I could not stay competitive in my industry by lowering them. I eventually had to cut my staff in half and now I am my business's only employee. My business is just staying afloat in today's current crisis. But, if it gets worse, I will have to shut her down. Getting rid of my employees was the hardest thing out of all of this because I had finally found some really good, honest and hardworking people. And, to see their hard work be rewarded with a pink slip just made me nothing more than heartbroken. I never wish that feeling on anybody. I know that I will be alright because I have invested my money wisely, but not everybody does that. I found that out when some of my employees would call and beg for their job back, would tell me that they are being foreclosed, that their spouse is leaving them or that they are days away from being on the street. I would get a little misty afterward. But, there was nothing I could do for them. My operating budget was gone and my business could no longer sustain ANY employees. I wish people did save when they are making good money. But, it seems that people today just do not live within their means. Even when somebody is making a few hundred thousand a year, they spend it all and in some cases consume even more than they make. So, don't be so ignorant with your little quips.

        "quote": "Originally posted by 10tenths: But, running a small business is extremely hard. For most, their employees make more than the owner and the owner works double the hours. Running your own business, even a successful one, is a lot harder than being an employee. You usually give yourself a small salary, just enough to pay your personal bills, so that your business has a little more in the budget. Any profit that your business makes goes right back into the business in the form of equipment, healthcare plans, HR/accounting services, leases, repairs, bonuses/raises for employees, etc. The profit is never saved because a business's requirements for future growth always outweigh whatever profits the business makes. So, the owner never gets his hand on any of those profits and the profits are always a couple years behind.",

If they forecast future actions anticipating more than about 12% of the market, then they are still padding the books (worse than the obamanation and their absurd understatement of projected deficits). Business majors worth a damn will not overstate projected sales. As far as executive bonuses are concerned, they are a drop in the bucket compared to the gross unfunded health and retirement benefits exacted by the unions--and agreed by myopic managers.",
