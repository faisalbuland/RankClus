Again, thanks for the links. When I was about 18 I witnessed a Bobby Kennedy drive through in my old neighborhood of Bensonhurst Brooklyn. He was in an open car, smiling and waving, and the crowd was absolutely bannana's. At the time I couldn't believe it... I mean I like the guy, but these people were absolutly crazy - I kid you not. I don't for a minute doubt that there are those who kiss the ground where Obama walks, and if they ever get their hands on his urine, will treasure it like holy water. But this is part of the time and the era we live in, and this Messiah business is basically phony Conservatives who have no other response than to throw phony rocks at him. I find it's use to be very offensive. Whatever critique I have of Obama, and I have many, he's NOT attempting a religious revival with himself as Jesus Christ. Dave",

He was in an open car, smiling and waving, and the crowd was absolutely bannana's. At the time I couldn't believe it... I mean I like the guy, but these people were absolutly crazy - I kid you not. I don't for a minute doubt that there are those who kiss the ground where Obama walks, and if they ever get their hands on his urine, will treasure it like holy water. But this is part of the time and the era we live in, and this Messiah business is basically phony Conservatives who have no other response than to throw phony rocks at him. I find it's use to be very offensive. Whatever critique I have of Obama, and I have many, he's NOT attempting a religious revival with himself as Jesus Christ. Dave",

Again, thanks for the links. When I was about 18 I witnessed a Bobby Kennedy drive through in my old neighborhood of Bensonhurst Brooklyn.
