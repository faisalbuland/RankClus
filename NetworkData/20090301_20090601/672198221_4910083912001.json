I saw a meteor come in so low and fast it left a smoke trail behind it, and I could almost hear it. Not exactly, I just felt the pressure of it passing. Maybe that was space debris, maybe a meteor. I dunno. It was kind of glowing, not real noticeable though. I've also seen aircraft turning at right angles in the sky. It was the Y2K New Year, nothing else was up up because everyone was so freaked out about that. It was in Iowa, on the flight path to the Omaha air base, so I figure those were Harriers or some other Air Force experimental toys. Not little green men.",
