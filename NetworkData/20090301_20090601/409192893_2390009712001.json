The proposal is politically problematic for President Obama, however, since it is similar to one he denounced in the presidential campaign as \u201cthe largest middle-class tax increase in history.\u201d Most Americans with insurance get it from their employers, and taxing workers for the benefit is opposed by union leaders and some businesses. In television advertisements last fall, Mr. Obama criticized his Republican rival for the presidency, Senator John McCain of Arizona, for proposing to tax all employer-provided health benefits. The benefits have long been tax-free, regardless of how generous they are or how much an employee earns. The advertisements did not point out that Mr. McCain, in exchange, wanted to give all families a tax credit to subsidize the purchase of coverage.

Now that Mr. Obama has begun the health debate, several advisers say that while he will not propose changing the tax-free status of employee health benefits, neither will he oppose it if Congress does so. At a recent Congressional hearing, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat whose own health plan would make benefits taxable, asked Peter R. Orszag, the president\u2019s budget director, about the issue. Mr. Orszag replied that it \u201cmost firmly should remain on the table.\u201d Mr. Orszag, an economist who has served as director of the Congressional Budget Office, has written favorably of taxing some employer-provided health benefits and using the revenue savings for other health-related incentives. So has another Obama adviser, Jason Furman, the deputy director of the White House National Economic Council.

And, they say, the policy discriminates against those \u2014 many of whom are low-income workers \u2014 who do not have employer-provided coverage. When Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, advocated taxing benefits at a recent hearing of the Finance Committee, which he leads, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner assured him that the administration was open to all ideas from Congress. Mr. Geithner did, however, allude to the position that Mr. Obama had taken as a candidate.

Also, Mr. Obama\u2019s own idea for raising revenues for health care \u2014 limiting the income tax deductions that the most affluent taxpayers claim \u2014 has run into opposition not only from Mr. Baucus but also from his counterpart in the House, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed limit on deductions would raise an estimated $318 billion over 10 years, or half of his proposed \u201chealth care reserve fund.\u201d That is a fraction of the revenues that could be raised from taxing employer-provided health benefits. In the campaign, Mr. McCain estimated that taxing all health benefits would raise $3.6 trillion over a decade \u2014 \u201ca multitrillion-dollar tax hike,\u201d one Obama advertisement said. The Congressional Budget Office says that including health benefits in taxable income could mean $246 billion in additional revenue for a single year. Stopping short of full taxation, as Mr. Baucus and others suggest, would mean less new revenue.

What will hopefully happen is that, as other programs are reduced and the tax burden is reorganized, there may still be a reduction in what you pay in taxes overall, but health care will simply be one of those things your taxes pay for.

'The urgency of this task has become undeniable.' Under the Montana Democrat's plan, all Americans would be required to hold a health insurance policy, going one step further than President-elect Barack Obama's plan. Individuals could keep their existing health plans or join a nationwide insurance pool to buy coverage, the price tag of which would be reduced with government subsidies.

        "quote": "Originally posted by mcgreer: quote: Originally posted by threerings: quote: Originally posted by mcgreer: When your sources of information are limited, you don't have much access to facts. This has been discussed for months. Max Baucus of Montana introduced a policy paper back in December that suggested capping tax breaks for health insurance premiums. These breaks would be based on income or the value of the benefits. This is basically the model for what Obama proposes. The President and Veep have been leaning in this direction for some time now, and they and the Dems in Congress are likely coming to some sort of compromise. As a person whose spouse paid into a national health care system (Germany) with her taxes, it doesn't seem a problem to me; it actually makes sense, as there aren't too many other ways to generate the revenues necessary to create the program the President is advocating. What will hopefully happen is that, as other programs are reduced and the tax burden is reorganized, there may still be a reduction in what you pay in taxes overall, but health care will simply be one of those things your taxes pay for. For some time? Like since..1-20-09? Or since the DAY AFTER he claimed he would never do this? You've stated what you think will \"hopefully\" happen. Let me tell you what will happen if this idea is turned into law: Every single middle class person will be taxed into the lower class. There will be NO middle class.. Just a bunch of under educated, under employeed people..all living in the same government built housing projects..all driving the same \"green\" car..all working for the same $4.75 an hour...all getting crappy health care. We won't be taxed that heavily. Now - this debate has gone on since during the campaign - and right after the election, Baucus introduced that policy paper I'm speaking of (read the actual paper here.).

These breaks would be based on income or the value of the benefits. This is basically the model for what Obama proposes. The President and Veep have been leaning in this direction for some time now, and they and the Dems in Congress are likely coming to some sort of compromise. As a person whose spouse paid into a national health care system (Germany) with her taxes, it doesn't seem a problem to me; it actually makes sense, as there aren't too many other ways to generate the revenues necessary to create the program the President is advocating. What will hopefully happen is that, as other programs are reduced and the tax burden is reorganized, there may still be a reduction in what you pay in taxes overall, but health care will simply be one of those things your taxes pay for. For some time? Like since..1-20-09? Or since the DAY AFTER he claimed he would never do this? You've stated what you think will \"hopefully\" happen. Let me tell you what will happen if this idea is turned into law: Every single middle class person will be taxed into the lower class. There will be NO middle class.. Just a bunch of under educated, under employeed people..all living in the same government built housing projects..all driving the same \"green\" car..all working for the same $4.75 an hour...all getting crappy health care. We won't be taxed that heavily.

'The urgency of this task has become undeniable.' Under the Montana Democrat's plan, all Americans would be required to hold a health insurance policy, going one step further than President-elect Barack Obama's plan. Individuals could keep their existing health plans or join a nationwide insurance pool to buy coverage, the price tag of which would be reduced with government subsidies.

Now that Mr. Obama has begun the health debate, several advisers say that while he will not propose changing the tax-free status of employee health benefits, neither will he oppose it if Congress does so. At a recent Congressional hearing, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat whose own health plan would make benefits taxable, asked Peter R.

The President and Veep have been leaning in this direction for some time now, and they and the Dems in Congress are likely coming to some sort of compromise. As a person whose spouse paid into a national health care system (Germany) with her taxes, it doesn't seem a problem to me; it actually makes sense, as there aren't too many other ways to generate the revenues necessary to create the program the President is advocating. What will hopefully happen is that, as other programs are reduced and the tax burden is reorganized, there may still be a reduction in what you pay in taxes overall, but health care will simply be one of those things your taxes pay for. For some time? Like since..1-20-09? Or since the DAY AFTER he claimed he would never do this? You've stated what you think will \"hopefully\" happen. Let me tell you what will happen if this idea is turned into law: Every single middle class person will be taxed into the lower class. There will be NO middle class.. Just a bunch of under educated, under employeed people..all living in the same government built housing projects..all driving the same \"green\" car..all working for the same $4.75 an hour...all getting crappy health care. We won't be taxed that heavily. Now - this debate has gone on since during the campaign - and right after the election, Baucus introduced that policy paper I'm speaking of (read the actual paper here.). If you don't feel like doing that - and I suspect most here won't - here's a news item from The Hill, dated 12 November 2008, the date of the release of his plan: \"Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus stepped to the forefront of the national debate over healthcare with a sweeping universal-coverage plan, pushing the issue to the top of the next Congress's agenda. 'In 2009, Congress must take up and act on meaningful health reform legislation that achieves coverage for all Americans while also addressing the underlying problems in our health system,' the Montana Democrat said in a policy paper released Wednesday. 'The urgency of this task has become undeniable.' Under the Montana Democrat's plan, all Americans would be required to hold a health insurance policy, going one step further than President-elect Barack Obama's plan. Individuals could keep their existing health plans or join a nationwide insurance pool to buy coverage, the price tag of which would be reduced with government subsidies. Insurers would not be allowed to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions, a centerpiece of Obama's plan...\" \"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/baucus-unveils-sweeping-healthcare-plan-2008-11-12.html\" Don't you guys get bored with seeing everything through a partisan political lens?
