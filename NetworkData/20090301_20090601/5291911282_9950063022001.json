When I worked in private sector, we always had Good Friday off, though I'm not 100% sure if that's still the case , as it's been 12 years ago. Now that I'm a Federal employee, I would have to plan to take leave if I wanted to observe the day that has so much meaning for me as a Christian. Life has changed a lot since I was a pup. It's hard to find a nice Easter card anymore, but there are fully packed store aisles with candy and baskets and toys. Seems like the priorities are leaning toward the materialistic things, and the spiritual things are getting lost in the shuffle.",

Went to a Lutheran Church (WELS) Good Friday service once many moons ago... it was a good reminder of the crucifixion. Thre were no flowers up front and the pulpit and alter were draped with black cloth (death). There are 3 good \"Collects\" (group prayers) in the Book of Common Prayer 1928 -(Google it: Anglicans Online or the Prayer Book Society, USA) for Good Friday. They are found on page 156 if you have access to a 1928 Cambridge edition BCP. Deep and profound and rich in wording. This message has been edited.

They did the same during the portion when the crowds yell \"crucify him\" When I was a kid in RI we got Good Friday off from school. 95% of my town was Roman Catholic (I was in the 5% as a LCMS Lutheran) So I think that played into it, though not sure if that still holds.
