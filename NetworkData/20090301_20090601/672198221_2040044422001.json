Keep in mind that it is the government that FEARS its own citizenry that needs to be kept on a very short and tight leash by those same citizens...this 2nd Amendment is an inherent RIGHT, not some arbitrary 'privilege' to be dished out only to certain passive 'pawns' who the government has beaten down or rendered summarily 'ineffective' and thus deemed not a 'threat' to the status quo. Why should the government even want to register guns, except to be able to 1) track 2) locate 3) CONFISCATE at the time of its choosing, 2nd Amendment 'right' or 'no 2nd Amendment right' notwithstanding. Don't laugh! Either Pittsburg or Philadelphia got caught RED-HANDED engaging in just such an illegal scheme. I think it was Filthydelphia, home of Independence Hall, no less! The city was busy compiling a detailed map and voluminous data base of \"WHO has HOW MANY of WHAT (guns) and WHERE\" in the city. Upon questioning, once this costly program info was discovered, the city admitted it had plans to eventually use this map and amassed data to locate, round up and confiscate firearms from Philadelphians at some undisclosed future time and date under guarded, strenuously undisclosed circumstances. Chilling, is it not? You'll ignore this, and any other illegal such acts by governmental agencies, until the day they come for YOURS. By then, it'll be too late. The U.N. has long salivated, sweated and slobbered over as-yet-unsuccessful plans to disarm the United States and other 'armed citizenry' nations that it desires to interact, interfere with and CONTROL eventually. Philadelphia was forced to SCRAP their whole controversial and admittedly intrusive, unconstitutional and secretive gun registry/locating program when the truth about it came out, and court action was threatened. Imagine if that fear-driven \"gun program\" went on, undiscovered...it's odd and funny how you separate what you call innocent 'registry' from eventual 'confiscation' and ultimately DENIAL of the right to keep and bear arms. Hitler's Germany pulled the wool over its citizens' eyes slowly, little step by seemingly innocuous little step, telling them all the while what was happening to them was really 'good' for them. It was anything but 'good' for them, as time and history has all too clearly shown. Will we LEARN from the Germans and others who fell under this sort of fatal hypnotic spell? Or, are we doomed to follow in the blind footsteps of the serfs and the slaves who sipped the poison 'hemlock' social propaganda spewed so loudly and so prolifically by, among many lesser others, Stalin, Mussolini, Lenin, Hitler and China's Mao Tse-Tung? Pity you if you follow the lemmings over the disarmament 'cliff'. I refuse to be a \"good little sheeple\" and to swallow the poison pill others so badly want me and the rest of the US and the free world to blindly and eagerly accept and swallow without any question or hesitation whatsoever. Do your own thing...more power to you...but don't even THINK about trying to take what's 2nd AMENDMENT RIGHTfully MINE away from me. It won't be pretty, GUARANTEED. Don't even try to go there. I've always obeyed the law, but I have a healthy, substantiated and confirmed intrinsic DISTRUST of the government and its furtive, always less-than-straightforward motives. I KNOW what is BEST for ME...my government (thankfully), DOES NOT! I'd like to keep it that way. They've clearly proven their gross ineptness, ingrained dishonesty and total disregard for our Constitution, for me and my fellow Americans, and what's lawfully and rightfully MINE, time and time again. Need I say more? Prove me WRONG...I hope I am, but I'm sure I'm CORRECT on this. Guns, and the ammo for them, are just like INSURANCE; it's far better to HAVE 'EM and NOT NEED 'EM, than to NEED THEM, and NOT HAVE ANY! \"Guard the fragile flame of Liberty jealously, lest it be snuffed out, and Darkness be allowed to prevail over us all.\" Stay strong, stay free.",

It's not a perfect system but it should at least make people think responsibly when they pass weapons on.

Hitler's Germany pulled the wool over its citizens' eyes slowly, little step by seemingly innocuous little step, telling them all the while what was happening to them was really 'good' for them. It was anything but 'good' for them, as time and history has all too clearly shown. Will we LEARN from the Germans and others who fell under this sort of fatal hypnotic spell? Or, are we doomed to follow in the blind footsteps of the serfs and the slaves who sipped the poison 'hemlock' social propaganda spewed so loudly and so prolifically by, among many lesser others, Stalin, Mussolini, Lenin, Hitler and China's Mao Tse-Tung?

I refuse to be a \"good little sheeple\" and to swallow the poison pill others so badly want me and the rest of the US and the free world to blindly and eagerly accept and swallow without any question or hesitation whatsoever. Do your own thing...more power to you...but don't even THINK about trying to take what's 2nd AMENDMENT RIGHTfully MINE away from me. It won't be pretty, GUARANTEED. Don't even try to go there. I've always obeyed the law, but I have a healthy, substantiated and confirmed intrinsic DISTRUST of the government and its furtive, always less-than-straightforward motives.

Keep in mind that it is the government that FEARS its own citizenry that needs to be kept on a very short and tight leash by those same citizens...this 2nd Amendment is an inherent RIGHT, not some arbitrary 'privilege' to be dished out only to certain passive 'pawns' who the government has beaten down or rendered summarily 'ineffective' and thus deemed not a 'threat' to the status quo. Why should the government even want to register guns, except to be able to 1) track 2) locate 3) CONFISCATE at the time of its choosing, 2nd Amendment 'right' or 'no 2nd Amendment right' notwithstanding. Don't laugh! Either Pittsburg or Philadelphia got caught RED-HANDED engaging in just such an illegal scheme. I think it was Filthydelphia, home of Independence Hall, no less! The city was busy compiling a detailed map and voluminous data base of \"WHO has HOW MANY of WHAT (guns) and WHERE\" in the city. Upon questioning, once this costly program info was discovered, the city admitted it had plans to eventually use this map and amassed data to locate, round up and confiscate firearms from Philadelphians at some undisclosed future time and date under guarded, strenuously undisclosed circumstances. Chilling, is it not? You'll ignore this, and any other illegal such acts by governmental agencies, until the day they come for YOURS. By then, it'll be too late. The U.N. has long salivated, sweated and slobbered over as-yet-unsuccessful plans to disarm the United States and other 'armed citizenry' nations that it desires to interact, interfere with and CONTROL eventually. Philadelphia was forced to SCRAP their whole controversial and admittedly intrusive, unconstitutional and secretive gun registry/locating program when the truth about it came out, and court action was threatened. Imagine if that fear-driven \"gun program\" went on, undiscovered...it's odd and funny how you separate what you call innocent 'registry' from eventual 'confiscation' and ultimately DENIAL of the right to keep and bear arms. Hitler's Germany pulled the wool over its citizens' eyes slowly, little step by seemingly innocuous little step, telling them all the while what was happening to them was really 'good' for them. It was anything but 'good' for them, as time and history has all too clearly shown. Will we LEARN from the Germans and others who fell under this sort of fatal hypnotic spell? Or, are we doomed to follow in the blind footsteps of the serfs and the slaves who sipped the poison 'hemlock' social propaganda spewed so loudly and so prolifically by, among many lesser others, Stalin, Mussolini, Lenin, Hitler and China's Mao Tse-Tung?

        "reply": "Yeah, and you are more blinded and foolish than you think...who is the GOVERNMENT to decide WHO gets to exercise the 2nd Amendment, and HOW? Keep in mind that it is the government that FEARS its own citizenry that needs to be kept on a very short and tight leash by those same citizens...this 2nd Amendment is an inherent RIGHT, not some arbitrary 'privilege' to be dished out only to certain passive 'pawns' who the government has beaten down or rendered summarily 'ineffective' and thus deemed not a 'threat' to the status quo. Why should the government even want to register guns, except to be able to 1) track 2) locate 3) CONFISCATE at the time of its choosing, 2nd Amendment 'right' or 'no 2nd Amendment right' notwithstanding. Don't laugh! Either Pittsburg or Philadelphia got caught RED-HANDED engaging in just such an illegal scheme. I think it was Filthydelphia, home of Independence Hall, no less! The city was busy compiling a detailed map and voluminous data base of \"WHO has HOW MANY of WHAT (guns) and WHERE\" in the city. Upon questioning, once this costly program info was discovered, the city admitted it had plans to eventually use this map and amassed data to locate, round up and confiscate firearms from Philadelphians at some undisclosed future time and date under guarded, strenuously undisclosed circumstances. Chilling, is it not? You'll ignore this, and any other illegal such acts by governmental agencies, until the day they come for YOURS. By then, it'll be too late. The U.N. has long salivated, sweated and slobbered over as-yet-unsuccessful plans to disarm the United States and other 'armed citizenry' nations that it desires to interact, interfere with and CONTROL eventually. Philadelphia was forced to SCRAP their whole controversial and admittedly intrusive, unconstitutional and secretive gun registry/locating program when the truth about it came out, and court action was threatened. Imagine if that fear-driven \"gun program\" went on, undiscovered...it's odd and funny how you separate what you call innocent 'registry' from eventual 'confiscation' and ultimately DENIAL of the right to keep and bear arms. Hitler's Germany pulled the wool over its citizens' eyes slowly, little step by seemingly innocuous little step, telling them all the while what was happening to them was really 'good' for them. It was anything but 'good' for them, as time and history has all too clearly shown. Will we LEARN from the Germans and others who fell under this sort of fatal hypnotic spell? Or, are we doomed to follow in the blind footsteps of the serfs and the slaves who sipped the poison 'hemlock' social propaganda spewed so loudly and so prolifically by, among many lesser others, Stalin, Mussolini, Lenin, Hitler and China's Mao Tse-Tung?

Just like the UN as a whole, one big comedy. No offense, but the RIGHT to bear arms was not some little law passed by Congess. It's part of the US Constitution itself. Ratified by three quarters of the States. No majority law can override the Constitution. Most Americans are well aware of this. Precedents have a nasty habit of biting back.

Any suggestion anywhere that free and unfettered access to lethal weapons might be a bad thing is utterly anathema to them. Besides this international thing might be bad for the gun trade and America still makes a pretty penny or two flogging guns. Any form of traceability would be a bad thing as foreign law enforcement might track a gun used in a crime back to an American factory and ask awkward questions. Such as, \"How did this gun what you made perfectly legally get into the hands of a drug dealer in London or Paris or wherever? Could it be that people are exercising their 2nd Amendment rights to buy guns and then flogging them on the black market to criminals?\" Thats one of the dumbest arguments I've ever heard in regards to this subject. So because we have guns, it's our fault that criminals can obtain them in Paris or London. I though you guys had stopped crime since banning guns How in the world do criminals in countries which have such strict laws still manage to get guns and commit crimes??? Give me a break. America is not Europe. It was relatively easy to ban guns in Europe because there were so few there to begin with, not to mention the fact that Europeans have no right to own them and have much lower crime rates to begin with. You've actually touched on my point - a lot of criminals are getting guns from the US via the black market. Old Eastern European weapons are still common but the newer stuff that the police are confiscating is often apparently US in origin. Guns made and sold legally in Europe tend to be traceable but US sourced ones often drop off the radar once they've left the factory or importer. The plod who came 'round to inspect my gun cabinet last time I renewed my firearms certificate told me about a collection of pistols that had been seized in a raid - they were mostly German in origin (Walthers and H&Ks IIRC) but when they called the factorys in an attempt to track the suppliers they were told that they'd all been exported to the US within the last year and the last the companies knew of them was when they went to the dealers. Now I'm not suggesting that you should all have to have certificates and register your serial numbers with plod - that would be too sensible - but I don't think it's too much to ask for all gun dealers to have to keep records of who they sell to and for all gun owners to keep records of who they pass a gun on to. It's not a perfect system but it should at least make people think responsibly when they pass weapons on. Grachus - I know what you're on about and to my mind it shows up one of the glaring problems with immutable written constitutions.
