It has nothing to do with Mexico's troubles.. that just makes a convenient excuse. Drug cartels are not using semi-auto US legal versions of AR's, AK's, etc... they are using full-auto military grade weapons from Central America etc. Some European countries have a higher rate of gun ownership than we do. The Swiss for example require every citizen to own a military weapon. Since I'm a Socialist, what then of your argument that \"socialists\" oppose guns? May I point out that while the Bush administration publicly saluted the recent Supreme Court ruling about gun ownership, they in fact sent in the Solicitor General to oppose the NRA backed challenge.

They have many uses and the most popular is probably target shooting. The overwhelming majority of people who legally purchase assault weapons will not kill anyone.

If civilian assault rifles were manufactured only for killing people, we'd have a lot more dead people. Neither civilians, nor the police can \"go around killing people\". Both however can legally kill criminals who present a direct threat to them and those around them. I've never heard of an \"assault weapons\" advocate before and people have \"settled for semi-automatic firearms\" ever since fully automatic weapons were all but banned in the early part of the last century. As far as I know, there has never been a concerted effort to overturn that ban. You still seem to miss the point; criminals are somewhat bad and will do bad things no matter what the laws say. Honest citizens are mostly good and will generally follow the laws. Murder is already against the law, yet people still commit the crime. If you ban all firearms, people will still use them to commit crimes. Except then, the honest citizens will be completely helpless. Police do not prevent crime. They keep it at bay.

As far as I know, there has never been a concerted effort to overturn that ban. You still seem to miss the point; criminals are somewhat bad and will do bad things no matter what the laws say. Honest citizens are mostly good and will generally follow the laws. Murder is already against the law, yet people still commit the crime. If you ban all firearms, people will still use them to commit crimes. Except then, the honest citizens will be completely helpless. Police do not prevent crime. They keep it at bay.

        "reply": "\"http://contexts.org/socimages/2008/01/06/equal-opportunity-gun-ownership/\" Dave The pictures could scare the beegee's out of some people that doesn't know the teenage girl in Levi's with a Kalashnikov but then again chances are they can't hide the weapon from authorities, the gun is registered and hopefully trained by someone that knows which end the bullet comes out of. Paranoid or not, the dangers of this world is real. Getting use to it doesn't help the little ole lady getting knocked on her fannie and beaten for a few dollars, or the guy that got carjacked and put in the hospital. People are getting mean as hell out there and unless you fortify your surroundings and never leave there is no amount of registering or limiting will help. Story on the news lately. A home invasion found Mom and Dad gone and a 11 year old upstairs. She had time to grab the Mosburg catching one ascending the stairs killing him instantly and the other confronting her took a blast in the shoulder. Bled to death. The young girl happened to be the skeet shooting champ of the county. Turn out the two illegal aliens was tied to another home invasion where the man was killed and his pistol taken. The gun the bleeder had on him. Personally, automatic weapons are useless for this ole fart. 12 gauge will get the job done.",

They have many uses and the most popular is probably target shooting. The overwhelming majority of people who legally purchase assault weapons will not kill anyone. If the government trusts me enough to put a machine gun in my hands and send me off to war, it should trust me enough to own a simple firearm. If civilian assault rifles were manufactured only for killing people, we'd have a lot more dead people. Neither civilians, nor the police can \"go around killing people\". Both however can legally kill criminals who present a direct threat to them and those around them. I've never heard of an \"assault weapons\" advocate before and people have \"settled for semi-automatic firearms\" ever since fully automatic weapons were all but banned in the early part of the last century. As far as I know, there has never been a concerted effort to overturn that ban. You still seem to miss the point; criminals are somewhat bad and will do bad things no matter what the laws say. Honest citizens are mostly good and will generally follow the laws. Murder is already against the law, yet people still commit the crime. If you ban all firearms, people will still use them to commit crimes. Except then, the honest citizens will be completely helpless. Police do not prevent crime. They keep it at bay. The very fact that they investigate crimes shows that a crime has already been committed. If a mugger pulls a knife on you the police will be of no help to you personally.",
