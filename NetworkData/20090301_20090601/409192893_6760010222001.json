Yet today, as the party contemplates the task of rebuilding itself, some Republicans say the issue of gay marriage may be turning into more of a hindrance than a help.

Is Rethinking Stance on Gay Marriage WASHINGTON \u2014 It was only five years ago that opposition to gay marriage was so strong that Republicans explicitly turned to the issue as a way to energize conservative voters. Yet today, as the party contemplates the task of rebuilding itself, some Republicans say the issue of gay marriage may be turning into more of a hindrance than a help. Consider this: In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, released on Monday, 31 percent of respondents over the age of 40 said they supported gay marriage. By contrast, 57 percent under age 40 said they supported it, a 26-point difference. Among the older respondents, 35 percent said they opposed any legal recognition of same-sex couples, be it marriage or civil unions. Among the younger crowd, just 19 percent held that view. Steve Schmidt, who was the senior strategist to Senator John McCain of Arizona during his presidential campaign, said in a speech and an interview that Republicans were in danger of losing these younger voters unless the party comes to appreciate how issues like gay marriage resonate, or do not resonate, with them. \u201cRepublicans should re-examine the extent to which we are being defined by positions on issues that I don\u2019t believe are among our core values, and that put us at odds with what I expect will become, over time, if not a consensus view, then the view of a substantial majority of voters,\u201d he said in a speech.

Until ya do, that sounds like either an outright lie, or some poll, (which may or may not have been accurate), deliberately spun to favor the homosexual activist agenda. Of course your tired old argument here is bullchit in its very premise. Gays are not another race, they are just a tiny number of our population born with an unfortunate birth defect. The vast majority of this country's citizens, (including people of every race), do not support redefining the ancient traditions and definitions of marriage to suit a few sexual deviants. If a state's citizens want to vote to allow it, then that's their right.. but gay activists' attempts to force the rest of us normal people to conform to your twisted beliefs through judicial fiat is counter to everything this country was founded on.",

Yet today, as the party contemplates the task of rebuilding itself, some Republicans say the issue of gay marriage may be turning into more of a hindrance than a help. Consider this: In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, released on Monday, 31 percent of respondents over the age of 40 said they supported gay marriage. By contrast, 57 percent under age 40 said they supported it, a 26-point difference. Among the older respondents, 35 percent said they opposed any legal recognition of same-sex couples, be it marriage or civil unions. Among the younger crowd, just 19 percent held that view. Steve Schmidt, who was the senior strategist to Senator John McCain of Arizona during his presidential campaign, said in a speech and an interview that Republicans were in danger of losing these younger voters unless the party comes to appreciate how issues like gay marriage resonate, or do not resonate, with them. \u201cRepublicans should re-examine the extent to which we are being defined by positions on issues that I don\u2019t believe are among our core values, and that put us at odds with what I expect will become, over time, if not a consensus view, then the view of a substantial majority of voters,\u201d he said in a speech.

        "quote": "Originally posted by IHAWKER: Signs G.O.P. Is Rethinking Stance on Gay Marriage WASHINGTON \u2014 It was only five years ago that opposition to gay marriage was so strong that Republicans explicitly turned to the issue as a way to energize conservative voters. Yet today, as the party contemplates the task of rebuilding itself, some Republicans say the issue of gay marriage may be turning into more of a hindrance than a help. Consider this: In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, released on Monday, 31 percent of respondents over the age of 40 said they supported gay marriage. By contrast, 57 percent under age 40 said they supported it, a 26-point difference. Among the older respondents, 35 percent said they opposed any legal recognition of same-sex couples, be it marriage or civil unions. Among the younger crowd, just 19 percent held that view. Steve Schmidt, who was the senior strategist to Senator John McCain of Arizona during his presidential campaign, said in a speech and an interview that Republicans were in danger of losing these younger voters unless the party comes to appreciate how issues like gay marriage resonate, or do not resonate, with them. \u201cRepublicans should re-examine the extent to which we are being defined by positions on issues that I don\u2019t believe are among our core values, and that put us at odds with what I expect will become, over time, if not a consensus view, then the view of a substantial majority of voters,\u201d he said in a speech.

Rick Warren, the hugely popular megachurch leader whose endorsement last year of Proposition 8, California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban, had roiled his appearance at the Obama inaugural. Warren also dropped in on Larry King to declare that he had \u201cnever\u201d been and \u201cnever will be\u201d an \u201canti-gay-marriage activist.\u201d This was an unmistakable slap at the National Organization for Marriage, which lavished far more money on Proposition 8 than even James Dobson\u2019s Focus on the Family.

        "reply": " There have been some interesting developments to be sure. quote: Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the self-help media star once notorious for portraying homosexuality as \u201ca biological error\u201d and a gateway to pedophilia, told CNN\u2019s Larry King that she now views committed gay relationships as \u201ca beautiful thing and a healthy thing.\u201d In The New York Post, the invariably witty and invariably conservative writer Kyle Smith demolished a Maggie Gallagher screed published in National Review and wondered whether her errant arguments against gay equality were \u201csomething else in disguise.\u201d More startling still was the abrupt about-face of the Rev. Rick Warren, the hugely popular megachurch leader whose endorsement last year of Proposition 8, California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban, had roiled his appearance at the Obama inaugural. Warren also dropped in on Larry King to declare that he had \u201cnever\u201d been and \u201cnever will be\u201d an \u201canti-gay-marriage activist.\u201d This was an unmistakable slap at the National Organization for Marriage, which lavished far more money on Proposition 8 than even James Dobson\u2019s Focus on the Family.

Again, looking at the GALLUP POLL numbers regarding interracial marriage, do you think people should have been allowed to vote on whether or not to allow interracial marriage since a majority disapproved? Interracial marriage was granted by \"judicial fiat\". Looking at vote results on referendums, the public HAS voted against gay marriage, and now gay rights groups are going to the courts to try and get them to override citizens' Constitutional rights. \"Judicial fiat\" comes into play because a law conflicts with the State or Federal Constitution. So, citizens are looking to change Constitutions and remove the conflict. The result? Apparently, gay groups want the courts to remove the power of the citzens to amend their Constitutions.",
