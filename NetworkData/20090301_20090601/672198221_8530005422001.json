The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba.

He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee.

The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report, and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file. \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency,\" Taguba, who retired in January 2007, was quoted as saying in the paper. He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee.

No doubt these photos are so perveted and sickening that people are going to begin demanding immediately that the people who haven't been charged in the photos (cause you know there's people who haven't) are charged and found guilty. LMAO, so he isnt releasing for political reasons? If it gets 1 American 1 scratch on his/her head its not worth it. Also, I can't believe these photos haven't been leaked yet. Translation, 'I am disappointed that they havent been leaked yet.....Just maybe the people holding the picks have more brains than the lemmings and political hacks that want them released. You know 'Big Picture', 'Long term thought' people",

The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report, and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file. \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency,\" Taguba, who retired in January 2007, was quoted as saying in the paper. He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee. Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube. The photographs relate to 400 alleged cases of abuse carried out at Abu Ghraib and six other prisons between 2001 and 2005. A scandal over abuse at Abu Ghraib erupted in 2004, after the release of photos that showed U.S. soldiers mistreating prisoners there.

The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report, and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file. \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency,\" Taguba, who retired in January 2007, was quoted as saying in the paper. He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee. Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube. The photographs relate to 400 alleged cases of abuse carried out at Abu Ghraib and six other prisons between 2001 and 2005. A scandal over abuse at Abu Ghraib erupted in 2004, after the release of photos that showed U.S. soldiers mistreating prisoners there.

The reasons why Obama doesn't want to release the photos is because they are going to **** Americans off more than the enemy. No doubt these photos are so perveted and sickening that people are going to begin demanding immediately that the people who haven't been charged in the photos (cause you know there's people who haven't) are charged and found guilty. Also, I can't believe these photos haven't been leaked yet.",

The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report, and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file. \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency,\" Taguba, who retired in January 2007, was quoted as saying in the paper. He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee. Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube. The photographs relate to 400 alleged cases of abuse carried out at Abu Ghraib and six other prisons between 2001 and 2005.

He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee. Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube. The photographs relate to 400 alleged cases of abuse carried out at Abu Ghraib and six other prisons between 2001 and 2005. A scandal over abuse at Abu Ghraib erupted in 2004, after the release of photos that showed U.S. soldiers mistreating prisoners there.

The reasons why Obama doesn't want to release the photos is because they are going to **** Americans off more than the enemy. No doubt these photos are so perveted and sickening that people are going to begin demanding immediately that the people who haven't been charged in the photos (cause you know there's people who haven't) are charged and found guilty. LMAO, so he isnt releasing for political reasons? If it gets 1 American 1 scratch on his/her head its not worth it. Also, I can't believe these photos haven't been leaked yet. Translation, 'I am disappointed that they havent been leaked yet.....Just maybe the people holding the picks have more brains than the lemmings and political hacks that want them released. You know 'Big Picture', 'Long term thought' people LMAO, so he isnt releasing for political reasons? If it gets 1 American 1 scratch on his/her head its not worth it.

The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report, and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file. \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency,\" Taguba, who retired in January 2007, was quoted as saying in the paper. He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee. Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube. The photographs relate to 400 alleged cases of abuse carried out at Abu Ghraib and six other prisons between 2001 and 2005. A scandal over abuse at Abu Ghraib erupted in 2004, after the release of photos that showed U.S. soldiers mistreating prisoners there.

The reasons why Obama doesn't want to release the photos is because they are going to **** Americans off more than the enemy. No doubt these photos are so perveted and sickening that people are going to begin demanding immediately that the people who haven't been charged in the photos (cause you know there's people who haven't) are charged and found guilty.

The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report, and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file. \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency,\" Taguba, who retired in January 2007, was quoted as saying in the paper. He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee. Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube. The photographs relate to 400 alleged cases of abuse carried out at Abu Ghraib and six other prisons between 2001 and 2005. A scandal over abuse at Abu Ghraib erupted in 2004, after the release of photos that showed U.S. soldiers mistreating prisoners there.

The reasons why Obama doesn't want to release the photos is because they are going to **** Americans off more than the enemy. No doubt these photos are so perveted and sickening that people are going to begin demanding immediately that the people who haven't been charged in the photos (cause you know there's people who haven't) are charged and found guilty. Also, I can't believe these photos haven't been leaked yet.",

The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report, and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file. \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency,\" Taguba, who retired in January 2007, was quoted as saying in the paper. He said he supported Obama's decision not to release them, even though Obama had previously pledged to disclose all images relating to abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. \"I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one,\" Taguba said. \"The sequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan. \"The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.\" The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee. Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube. The photographs relate to 400 alleged cases of abuse carried out at Abu Ghraib and six other prisons between 2001 and 2005. A scandal over abuse at Abu Ghraib erupted in 2004, after the release of photos that showed U.S. soldiers mistreating prisoners there. From the article: ++http://news.aol.com/article/iraq-torture-photos/501890?icid=main|main|dl1|link3|http%3A%2F%2Fnews.aol.com%2Farticle%2Firaq-torture-photos%2F501890 I've been saying this all along. The reasons why Obama doesn't want to release the photos is because they are going to **** Americans off more than the enemy. No doubt these photos are so perveted and sickening that people are going to begin demanding immediately that the people who haven't been charged in the photos (cause you know there's people who haven't) are charged and found guilty. LMAO, so he isnt releasing for political reasons? If it gets 1 American 1 scratch on his/her head its not worth it. Also, I can't believe these photos haven't been leaked yet. Translation, 'I am disappointed that they havent been leaked yet.....Just maybe the people holding the picks have more brains than the lemmings and political hacks that want them released. You know 'Big Picture', 'Long term thought' people LMAO, so he isnt releasing for political reasons? If it gets 1 American 1 scratch on his/her head its not worth it. And just because it wasnt splashed in the media of the people who allegedly did these crimes being punished doesnt mean they didnt get punished. Already past the future",
