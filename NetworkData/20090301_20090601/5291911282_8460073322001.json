Does anybody know of any books out there that cover optics and optic/infrared basics? I need something that will give me a better understanding of wavelengths, photo-optics, etc without starting with an equation! The other book I'm \"reading\" is the \"Electro-Optics Handbook\". I need something to help me understand this one as well. Thanks in advance!!!!",
