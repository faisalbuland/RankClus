The funny thing is people still belive you need correct intel to go to war. This war was going to happen one way or another. does it matter who lied then or who lie's now. it's done we are there get over it congress and start doing your job and get us the heck out of there. What do you mean \"get us the heck out of there\"? Wasn't that the whole point, a US footprint in the middle-east as a staging area for additional \"GWOT operations\"? Didn't the last administration state this struggle would go on for years? I guess they forgot to mention it would be with the same troops for years. You are correct, he did say those exact words. Iraq was intregal in the GWOT. Personally, I think that's the real reason he had us invade. I absolutely agree, however GWOT is just a term. Have you ever read \"Project for a New American Century\". It's all there, including the necessary attack on America and the signatures. The documents date back to 1998 I believe. Google it, it's like a roadmap.",
