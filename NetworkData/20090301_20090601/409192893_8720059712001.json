Read about the JIEDDO here. Educate yourself. There's tons of open source, factual information out here that's easy as hell to find - but it seems that very few people are interested in facts and so many are content to just deal with the easy stuff that comes from the TV. I'm sure glad I don't watch it... Anyway - This organization has a budget of over $4 billion to develop systems that will defeat IEDs.

I swear from recalling some of things Bush said that he sounds like a closet case liberal himself. I have often wondered why somone has not come up with a computer transmitter that could sent out radiowave that would set these things off. we have computers that can do millions of calculations per secound why not have one that will transmit millions of frequencys per secound where it may not work all the time if it would cause 75% to go off befor they were able to do damage to our troops it would be a start. from what i understand some of these are set off but old cell phones, wouldnt this work? D.J. Because it is really hard to pull all of that off, and when you do they shift to another strategy that renders your countermeasure useless. In answer to your specific question, you would first need a transmitter suitable for every frequency of interest. This would require multiple systems to cover every kind of commercially available hand-held transmitter out there from cell phone to walkie. You would then need to transmit the appropriate set of codes on each frequency which correspond to the contact hand-shakes used on that frequency. In other words, you would have to call every cell phone number possible in each band, and repeat it whenever you enter a new transmission radius (every minute? second?). Do this simultaneously from every convoy or patrol, at every hour of every day, essentially eliminating wireless communications. About two days later the bad guys will figure out how to block the incoming calls and wire to a circuit that only accepts \"friendly\" cell numbers.

D.J. You have never heard of the JIEDDO, the DoD Joint IED Defeat Organization? Wow. No offense - but every day I spend back in the States, I continue to be amazed at the general ignorance out here. It's incredible. I do believe that television is the number one source for news and information, and it fails miserably, especially in the area of what passes for news these days. Read about the JIEDDO here. Educate yourself. There's tons of open source, factual information out here that's easy as hell to find - but it seems that very few people are interested in facts and so many are content to just deal with the easy stuff that comes from the TV. I'm sure glad I don't watch it... Anyway - This organization has a budget of over $4 billion to develop systems that will defeat IEDs. And, despite all the money thrown at this problem, people are still going to get killed by IEDs. To think that you can stop them all is totally unrealistic. The people who are building them adapt, just as those who try to defeat them do.",

I swear from recalling some of things Bush said that he sounds like a closet case liberal himself. I have often wondered why somone has not come up with a computer transmitter that could sent out radiowave that would set these things off. we have computers that can do millions of calculations per secound why not have one that will transmit millions of frequencys per secound where it may not work all the time if it would cause 75% to go off befor they were able to do damage to our troops it would be a start. from what i understand some of these are set off but old cell phones, wouldnt this work? D.J. Because it is really hard to pull all of that off, and when you do they shift to another strategy that renders your countermeasure useless. In answer to your specific question, you would first need a transmitter suitable for every frequency of interest. This would require multiple systems to cover every kind of commercially available hand-held transmitter out there from cell phone to walkie. You would then need to transmit the appropriate set of codes on each frequency which correspond to the contact hand-shakes used on that frequency. In other words, you would have to call every cell phone number possible in each band, and repeat it whenever you enter a new transmission radius (every minute? second?). Do this simultaneously from every convoy or patrol, at every hour of every day, essentially eliminating wireless communications. About two days later the bad guys will figure out how to block the incoming calls and wire to a circuit that only accepts \"friendly\" cell numbers.

Wow. No offense - but every day I spend back in the States, I continue to be amazed at the general ignorance out here. It's incredible. I do believe that television is the number one source for news and information, and it fails miserably, especially in the area of what passes for news these days. Read about the JIEDDO here. Educate yourself. There's tons of open source, factual information out here that's easy as hell to find - but it seems that very few people are interested in facts and so many are content to just deal with the easy stuff that comes from the TV. I'm sure glad I don't watch it... Anyway - This organization has a budget of over $4 billion to develop systems that will defeat IEDs. And, despite all the money thrown at this problem, people are still going to get killed by IEDs. To think that you can stop them all is totally unrealistic. The people who are building them adapt, just as those who try to defeat them do. Thank you all for replying to my post and thank you mcgreer for the lead. I realize that there is not going to be a single device (or \"magic bullet\") that will do everything needed. What I'm referring more to is maybe what can be referred to a multistrategy approach. Instead of solely a \"frontal\" (as in a conventional warfare strategy) approach, it would entail a parallel strategy.",

Wow. No offense - but every day I spend back in the States, I continue to be amazed at the general ignorance out here. It's incredible. I do believe that television is the number one source for news and information, and it fails miserably, especially in the area of what passes for news these days. Read about the JIEDDO here. Educate yourself. There's tons of open source, factual information out here that's easy as hell to find - but it seems that very few people are interested in facts and so many are content to just deal with the easy stuff that comes from the TV.
