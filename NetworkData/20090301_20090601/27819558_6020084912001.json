The current effort by conservatives to block gay service is led by the Center for Military Readiness, which opposes women and gays in combat. The group's president, Elaine Donnelly, came under national criticism last summer when she told congress that gays would \"sexualize the atmosphere\" and engage in \"passive aggressive behavior.\" In the fall, CMR was implicated in an effort to identify \"gay horror stories.\" But conservative activists acknowledged, in another leaked document, that such stories would be \"very difficult to find.\" Donnelly testified before Congress last year using one such story that turned out to have been 34 years old. Some observers viewed the effort by CMR as part of an expected national dialogue on the issue of gays in the military. \"There have always been different opinions in the military,\" said Dr. Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center and a professor of political science at University of California, Santa Barbara. \"That's how we get the best strategic advice.\" Read the full article at > >http://newswire.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/behold.pl?ascribeid=20090331.115342&time=13%2055%20PDT&year=2009&public=0",

How long since their last deployment with a tactical or operational unit? To borrow from Han Solo, where are they digging up these old fossils? More to the point, why can't they find anybody closer to modern military experience? Hell, BOTH of these guys retired prior to the current policy, which has been in place more than half of my adult life! Why is their opinion even relevant? One of these Generals has, quite appropriately, been running a museum since he retired. That about says it all, don't you think?",
