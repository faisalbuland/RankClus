About the time our original thirteen states adopted their new constitution in 1787, Alexander Tyler, a Scottish history professor at the University of Edinburgh , had this to say about the fall of the Athenian Republic some 2,000 years earlier: 'A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government.' 'A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury.' 'From that moment on, the majority always vote for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.' 'The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years'. 'During those 200 years, those nations always progressed through the following sequence: 1. From bondage to spiritual faith; 2. From spiritual faith to great courage; 3. From courage to liberty; 4. From liberty to abundance; 5. From abundance to complacency; 6. From complacency to apathy; 7. From apathy to dependence; 8. From dependence back into bondage' Professor Joseph Olson of Hamline University School of Law, St. Paul , Minnesota , points out some interesting facts concerning the 2000 Presidential election: Number of States won by: Democrats: 19 Republicans: 29 Square miles of land won by: Democrats: 580,000 Republicans: 2,427,000 Population of counties won by: Democrats: 127 million Republicans: 143 million Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by: Democrats: 13.2 Republicans: 2.1 Professor Olson adds: 'In aggregate, the map of the territory Republican won was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of this great country. Democrat territory mostly encompassed those citizens living in government-owned tenements and living off various forms of government welfare...' Olson believes the United States is now somewhere between the 'complacency and apathy' phase of Professor Tyler's definition of democracy, with some forty percent of the nation's population already having reached the 'governmental dependency' phase. If Congress grants amnesty and citizenship to twenty million criminal invaders called illegal's and they vote, then we can say goodbye to the USA in fewer than five years.",

When contacted via e-mail, Professor Olson confirmed that he had no authorship or involvement in this matter.\" --Savage If it supports your position, it doesn't matter if it's a lie. quote: When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. - The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\", 1962 It should also be pointed out that when discussing the life span of countries, \"average\" has about as much wieght as a pile of dog poop. If one reads the Federalist Papers, Two Ancient societies and their Constitutions were considered by the Founders. Athens was one of them, and the fault that the Founders wrote about, was thier lack of Constitutional restrictions. What the majority wanted was Instantly the law. There was no law or custom that could not be immediately altered. No restraints as our Constitution has. No Checks and balances. Total change could take place on one afternoon. They then examined the Roman Constitution, where a willful minority could prevent ANY change no matter how necessary or important. There was no mechanism for altering the system. Our Constitution has already lasted almost four times the lenth of Athenian Democracy, and about the same amount of time as the Roman one. As long as we respect OUR guiding law, we as a nation will endure. As Lincoln said, if our country fails, it wont be from a foreign invasion, it will be by suicide. Dave",
