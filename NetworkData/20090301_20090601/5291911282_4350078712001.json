There are several things that hold a Nation or Empire together: Common Politics/Laws, Common History/Traditions, Common Culture/Trade, Common Language, Common Religion, and Common Race.

Their attitude is, \"That is YOUR History/Language, not MINE and I don't want it! This land is rightfully MINE.

What's easier...we learn all of their different languages or they learn ours? Don Not everyone who sets foot in the US, as a foreigner, is an immigrant. Just as it is a major relief to hear a Spaniard or Pole speak to me in English when I'm in Spain or Poland, think how great it would be for someone from Europe or Asia to hear his/her native language in an effort to make that person feel welcome. My point is that many Americans equate learning another language with giving aid and comfort to some unnamed and amorphous enemy - the \"not us.\" Language programs in public schools - French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, even Latin for pete's sake - are in terrible shape. Americans don't know their own language, let alone a second one. Those whose families (parents, other relatives, in-laws) speak more than one language, and so grow up or become bilingual or trilingual, are extremely fortunate. They are more employable in a global market and promote their businesses in a positive way. My point is that xenophobia gets us nowhere fast, and in fact puts us in reverse. I don't support giving illegal aliens anything but a fast return trip to wherever they came from, BUT that is not the same thing as playing to the ethnic market in your area. I don't care for WalMart or the crap it sells, but I don't know many who would argue with its business success. New York City has had \"Little Italy,\" \"Little Russia,\" Jewish sections, Caribbean sections and so on for decades, if not centuries.

        "reply": " This is what I was talking about last week, in the caf'e Renne thread, when I got my butt chewed out by my boss. Imagine haveingspoken thai, indian and Burmees languages where you work. I t would help if there was common language, say english. Having multiple languages in a society or work place does not pull people together. Is this legal? I don't know,but its fun isn't?!",

In Europe, Asia, Africa, even the more industrialized areas of South America, the majority of the populations speak a second language - usually English. Somehow, that doesn't equate to a personal threat or a perceived attack against their individual nationalities. Are we really so smug, so superior to the rest of the world that we can't learn another language without fear of being thought of as less than patriotic? Honestly, sometimes the ways of my fellow countrymen drive me to despair. Well if I ever plan on visiting another country, sure, I would make the effort to learn their language. Why should I have to learn their language so they can be comfortable here in the U.S.? If we cater to their needs, what would motivate them to learn to speak English so we can deal with them one on one here in the U.S.? It sounds like your idea is that we need to learn their language to make things easier for them here in the U.S., and not put the burden on them. Afterall, it was their decision to leave their country and come to the U.S., was it not? Look at all the immigrants that come here from so many different countries. What's easier...we learn all of their different languages or they learn ours? Don Not everyone who sets foot in the US, as a foreigner, is an immigrant. Just as it is a major relief to hear a Spaniard or Pole speak to me in English when I'm in Spain or Poland, think how great it would be for someone from Europe or Asia to hear his/her native language in an effort to make that person feel welcome. My point is that many Americans equate learning another language with giving aid and comfort to some unnamed and amorphous enemy - the \"not us.\" Language programs in public schools - French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, even Latin for pete's sake - are in terrible shape. Americans don't know their own language, let alone a second one. Those whose families (parents, other relatives, in-laws) speak more than one language, and so grow up or become bilingual or trilingual, are extremely fortunate. They are more employable in a global market and promote their businesses in a positive way. My point is that xenophobia gets us nowhere fast, and in fact puts us in reverse. I don't support giving illegal aliens anything but a fast return trip to wherever they came from, BUT that is not the same thing as playing to the ethnic market in your area. I don't care for WalMart or the crap it sells, but I don't know many who would argue with its business success. New York City has had \"Little Italy,\" \"Little Russia,\" Jewish sections, Caribbean sections and so on for decades, if not centuries. Somehow, despite having native-language stores, newspapers, restaurants and the like, people manage to become \"American\" in time. For information I do speak a little bit of Spanish that I took in high school. But I will be darned if I am going to sit around and talk in Spanish with the illegal aliens! This is my country and here I speak English. If a person from a foreign country is visiting here in this country then I will make every attempt to converse with them in whatever language that they speak (or use sign language if necessary). But to have someone sneak across the border into this country and try to change my culture, my language or my way of living then I must protest loudly and with emphasis! Learn my language as I attempt to learn your language when I travel to your country. I will not come (sneak)into your country and fly your flag upside down, I will not march in your streets demanding the you give me welfare, a free education, free medical care and all of the rights and freedoms that your citizens have. I just ask that you do the same if you come into this country. Do it legally and we will go from there. No cider alpha we don't mind learning another language we just don't want another language forced onto us!",
