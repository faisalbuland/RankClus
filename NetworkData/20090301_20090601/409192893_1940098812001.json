Hilary went to check up on things going on in south America...or Mexico...and she said that we are co-sponsers of the problems there with our guns making it into mexico...what planet does she live in?? I was informed that back in the 60's and 70's and thereabouts...that we sent weapons to south america to help the gov.'s deal with terrorists like the sandanestas...(sorry for misspelling).. the guns they have down there are from the criminals and terrorists raiding or toppling over police stations and armories. we helped the then gov's back then and i think even sent in some of our own troops. Im sure there is more to the story. I think also ..and these are my thoughts..poverty drives them...people after so long a time want something in their lives and esp for their chldren. so after awhile of playing it straight they succomb to stealing and getting involved in terrorists activity.. like if you cant beat em join em. I feel for the mexican people and any south americans who dont want to live that way..its a result of having BAD EVIL GOVERNMENTS...THAT TAKE OVER LATER...OR EVENTUALLY... we are at fault in some cases... BUT MY WARNING IN THIS IS:...YOU KNOW HOW THE LEFT AND HILARY IS AS LEFT AS YOU GET..WANT TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS...WELL, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE AGENDA TO DO SO... well, with me it wont fly..because how will we protect ourselves when the border gets weaker..since there is such a big argument over should be protect our borders.. i live in a border state...I know its next to impossible to do that..so Hilary better think twice before using that on us..because we dont send our guns down there..our gov did back then but only to help out the mexican gov fight their terrorists... so anyone reading sound off..esp if you know more..even if you have a lefty slant..but know this..you will be exposed as a lefty..hahah",

Whether this right pertains to individuals acting independently or individuals acting collectively was once a matter of debate, and the basis for any right at all hotly contested. However, on June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held that Americans have an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense in the case District of Columbia v. Heller.: a landmark legal case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for private use. It was the first Supreme Court case in United States history to directly address whether the right to keep and bear arms is a right of individuals or a collective right that applies only to state-regulated militias. The argument I hear most for \"gun control\" is that \"no one needs an automatic weapon, assault weapon, or pistol for hunting ...\" I have never heard or seen any 2nd ammendment interpretation as the right to bear arms referred to 'hunting'. Although in self defense, I might use a single shot rifle to protect my family or myself, I would much rather add the psychological advantage of using a machine gun! It would eliminate one witness who felt I used excessive force! ... and insure that at least one individual who would do me harm is eliminated. As to the claims of illegal gun sales to the Drug Cartels, I have yet to see evidence that any legitimate gun dealer has sold weapons to the Cartels. Also, the weapons serial numbers can be traced yet none of these numbers has been released to provide for verification of where these weapons originated or the path they took till eventually ending up in 'Cartel' hands.",

Still didn't answer the question. What are you proposing we do with the people who steal to support their habit, illegal or not? And can you show me where treatment actually WORKS... as in actually cures the user of addiction? What percent of users do you actually think will stay off drugs even if they get treatment, and what percent will quit stealing to support this habit? While alcohol is addictive, it's not the bugaboo that coke is. Nor heroine. Nor crack. not a dozen other drugs that are a bit harder to cook up in your bathtub. Less blather and more answers, please. Realistic answers. I've noticed that the ones crying legalization are usually users. What is it that *you* use... thereby inviting that this criminality and murder be visited on our shores? And marijuana. Why is it that people who want to \"legalize drugs\" often say they only use marijuana? If you simply want to legalize marijuana, why don't you say so? Do you think we should legalize weed, separately? And, if we do, how do you imagine parents are going to keep it from their kids? It's tough enough parenting today. Making something readily available would certainly make it harder to monitor the prevalence in the neighborhood and the house. Would you sell it in liquor stores? That separate aisle in the grocery store? Get off the crap and tell your friends to get off it too. Show kids in no uncertain terms that there's a better way. Don't be a p u s s y. You can do it.",

FIRST the film shown bo OUR Border guards showed some VERY nice shotguns, including a couple of EXPENSIVE superposed 12 guns that I'd be PROUD to own. SECOND they showed 35-40 on a table lined up, every one had a real Wood stock, they looked mostly like inexpensive shotguns and rifles you might want down on the farm. So, these are NOT \"cartel\" automatics. Indeed, with no Federal Stamp you cannot buy an automatic 'Assault\" type weapon. Only an auto loader, Then they showed the MEXICAN FEDERAL POLICE gun racks, and THERE were M-16 type arms, pretty beaten up, and other \"Assault\" type arms. Now, if the M-16 types came from the US, I'm betting they were shipped government to government as \"aide\" for the Mex. Gvt., and if a Cartel had them, the POLICE sold them to the Cartel. THAT'S why Mexico refuses to release the S #'s along with make, model, cal,. What is worse,is the \"suspension of disbelief\" that Hillary displayed in relation to this hoax. Why has she adopted this lie as her own GoD given THUTH?",
