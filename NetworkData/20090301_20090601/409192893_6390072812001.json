I believe that the main reason nobody wants the job as his assistant is because the economy is a mess and nobody wants to waste their time trying to fix it and second that there is no plan in place to fix it. That said I give Geithner another 6 to 10 months in office before he is gone. I also believe Richard Dodd will be out of office soon too. What say you?",
