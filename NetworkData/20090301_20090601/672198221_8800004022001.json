It is very respectful (I have seen the display myself.) problem is that the HOA of one of(if not the top) richest subdivisions in the county (he lives in this subdivision) says it is not allowed and has even started fining him $25 a day for the display.

Hell it may be someone else may know. If it's not it, it certainly should be. Many HOA have rules about HOW things, including the US flag, can be displayed. A lot of the rules boil down to the display can not be to large and intrusive (lights on all night, ceremony that includes loud playing of taps, etc.). Most of the rules I've seen give a maximum height for the pole and a max size for the flag and since it cost the man $1,000 to put up the pole it is probably to tall and the flag to large. Plus since these are HOA rules the home owner AGREED to them BEFORE he moved in so if he did not like the rules he should NOT have bought a house covered by those rules.",

So what in boils down to is Mr. Tripodo does not feel he has to follow the terms of the contract HE SIGNED. Heck the HOA was even willing to make an exception to allow him to have his flag pole in the back yard but Mr. Tripodo would not agree. This looks like a simple case of one man feeling the rules should not apply to him.",

HOA's are geared more for making sure junk cars and other crap is not out front for everyone to see or some knucklehead that wants to paint his house purple and yellow. Flying our flag should not be a problem unless this is a 75 ft flag pole with a huge car dealer type flag on it. Let the man fly the flag for petes sake, it's a 14 ft flag pole, I don't see a problem with it. Rayld2,the roof of the houses are way over 14 ft in elevation, it is not an eye sore, though I have not seen it but how could it be?

A lot of the rules boil down to the display can not be to large and intrusive (lights on all night, ceremony that includes loud playing of taps, etc.). Most of the rules I've seen give a maximum height for the pole and a max size for the flag and since it cost the man $1,000 to put up the pole it is probably to tall and the flag to large.

I guess the house is more important than the flag.",

Sounds like they want to meet him half way and as least let him fly it in the backyard so he is not out the money and can still fly his flag with pride. Plus, I think the grand big flag and pole are much better looking than the little pole off the house. Plus it sounds like the rules alow him to have a flag ATTACHED tot he house just not a free standing one. All in All it sounds like the man signed a contract and then broke the contract just so he could have a bigger flag display than his neighbors or who just does not believe he has to follow the rules. It sounds like this is just another case about some self absorbed rich guy (he lives in \"one of the richest subdivisions in the county\") who thinks the rules don't apply to him.",

This looks like a simple case of one man feeling the rules should not apply to him.",

HOA's are geared more for making sure junk cars and other crap is not out front for everyone to see or some knucklehead that wants to paint his house purple and yellow. Flying our flag should not be a problem unless this is a 75 ft flag pole with a huge car dealer type flag on it. Let the man fly the flag for petes sake, it's a 14 ft flag pole, I don't see a problem with it. Rayld2,the roof of the houses are way over 14 ft in elevation, it is not an eye sore, though I have not seen it but how could it be? Some rules ya just gotta break, this is one of them for me, where do I mail my check to?",
