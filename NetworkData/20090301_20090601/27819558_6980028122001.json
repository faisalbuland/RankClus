        "content": "The Challenge of Service West Point graduate Becky Kanis is the sort of woman who is attracted to a challenge. This is exactly the sort of person our armed forces seek out to serve as officers in leading our troops. She was the responsible eldest of seven children in a Catholic family, a high school soccer athlete, and was encouraged to excel in everything that she did. While she was selecting a college to attend, she was repeatedly cautioned against the difficulty of attending West Point; she was told that it was \"miserable,\" and that military service might include having to fight an unjust war. The more discouragement she heard, the more she knew that attending West Point was exactly what she wanted to do. Her SAT scores were exactly what they sought. A military academy could not have hoped for a better cadet. She was offered early admission and a full scholarship. West Point captured her imagination. She wanted the education and adventure; she was attracted to the underlying value of contributing to something greater than herself along with the sense of service to American ideals and leadership. Becky Kanis entered West Point in 1987, was commissioned in 1991, and served in the US Army Signal corps until 2000, leaving as a Captain. During her service she earned a Meritorious Service Medal, two Humanitarian Service Medals, an Army Commendation Medal, an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, a Senior Parachutist's Badge, and an Air Assault Badge. In March she became the Chairwoman of Knights Out, an organization of LGBT and Straight West Point Alumni dedicated to repealing the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy and to helping West Point prepare for change when open service is permitted.
