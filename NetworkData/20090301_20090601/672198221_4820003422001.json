Governor Martin O'Malley, a dedicated class warrior, declared that these richest 0.3% of filers were \"willing and able to pay their fair share.\" The Baltimore Sun predicted the rich would \"grin and bear it.\" One year later, nobody's grinning. One-third of the millionaires have disappeared from Maryland tax rolls. In 2008 roughly 3,000 million-dollar income tax returns were filed by the end of April. This year there were 2,000, which the state comptroller's office concedes is a \"substantial decline.\" On those missing returns, the government collects 6.25% of nothing. Instead of the state coffers gaining the extra $106 million the politicians predicted, millionaires paid $100 million less in taxes than they did last year -- even at higher rates. No doubt the majority of that loss in millionaire filings results from the recession. However, this is one reason that depending on the rich to finance government is so ill-advised: Progressive tax rates create mountains of cash during good times that vanish during recessions. For evidence, consult California, New York and New Jersey (see here). The Maryland state revenue office says it's \"way too early\" to tell how many millionaires moved out of the state when the tax rates rose. But no one disputes that some rich filers did leave. It's easier than the redistributionists think. Christopher Summers, president of the Maryland Public Policy Institute, notes: \"Marylanders with high incomes typically own second homes in tax friendlier states like Florida, Delaware, South Carolina and Virginia.

Ya like that is soooo the American way. When people are fed up with the bloated taxes they have to pay because they are \"rich\" and move away now you want to confiscate all their money if they choose to move to another country. GG so much for freedom. How about this instead of spending more money how about people balance their budget and make people dig themselves out. This is freaking rediculous. By your thinking its the Government that deserves that money. Well they don't. They don't own those businesses. The government didn't come up with the ideas and drive those people to succeed. This is straight up a travesty of all I've spent my entire adult life defending.",

One-third of the millionaires have disappeared from Maryland tax rolls. In 2008 roughly 3,000 million-dollar income tax returns were filed by the end of April. This year there were 2,000, which the state comptroller's office concedes is a \"substantial decline.\" On those missing returns, the government collects 6.25% of nothing. Instead of the state coffers gaining the extra $106 million the politicians predicted, millionaires paid $100 million less in taxes than they did last year -- even at higher rates. No doubt the majority of that loss in millionaire filings results from the recession. However, this is one reason that depending on the rich to finance government is so ill-advised: Progressive tax rates create mountains of cash during good times that vanish during recessions. For evidence, consult California, New York and New Jersey (see here). The Maryland state revenue office says it's \"way too early\" to tell how many millionaires moved out of the state when the tax rates rose. But no one disputes that some rich filers did leave. It's easier than the redistributionists think. Christopher Summers, president of the Maryland Public Policy Institute, notes: \"Marylanders with high incomes typically own second homes in tax friendlier states like Florida, Delaware, South Carolina and Virginia. So it's easy for them to change their residency.\" All of this means that the burden of paying for bloated government in Annapolis will fall on the middle class. Thanks to the futility of soaking the rich, these working families will now pay Mr. O'Malley's \"fair share.\" Source: \"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124329282377252471.html\" Implement it nationwide, and freeze the US assets of (in addition to revoking the citizenship of) any who flee to other countries to try to dodge their taxes.", 
        "reply": " Ya like that is soooo the American way. When people are fed up with the bloated taxes they have to pay because they are \"rich\" and move away now you want to confiscate all their money if they choose to move to another country. GG so much for freedom. How about this instead of spending more money how about people balance their budget and make people dig themselves out. This is freaking rediculous. By your thinking its the Government that deserves that money. Well they don't. They don't own those businesses. The government didn't come up with the ideas and drive those people to succeed. This is straight up a travesty of all I've spent my entire adult life defending.",

Instead of the state coffers gaining the extra $106 million the politicians predicted, millionaires paid $100 million less in taxes than they did last year -- even at higher rates. No doubt the majority of that loss in millionaire filings results from the recession. However, this is one reason that depending on the rich to finance government is so ill-advised: Progressive tax rates create mountains of cash during good times that vanish during recessions. For evidence, consult California, New York and New Jersey (see here). The Maryland state revenue office says it's \"way too early\" to tell how many millionaires moved out of the state when the tax rates rose. But no one disputes that some rich filers did leave. It's easier than the redistributionists think. Christopher Summers, president of the Maryland Public Policy Institute, notes: \"Marylanders with high incomes typically own second homes in tax friendlier states like Florida, Delaware, South Carolina and Virginia. So it's easy for them to change their residency.\" All of this means that the burden of paying for bloated government in Annapolis will fall on the middle class. Thanks to the futility of soaking the rich, these working families will now pay Mr. O'Malley's \"fair share.\" Source: \"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124329282377252471.html\" So, if I read that correctly, taxes went UP and revenues went DOWN.

And because cities such as Baltimore and Bethesda also impose income taxes, the state-local tax rate can go as high as 9.45%. Governor Martin O'Malley, a dedicated class warrior, declared that these richest 0.3% of filers were \"willing and able to pay their fair share.\" The Baltimore Sun predicted the rich would \"grin and bear it.\" One year later, nobody's grinning. One-third of the millionaires have disappeared from Maryland tax rolls. In 2008 roughly 3,000 million-dollar income tax returns were filed by the end of April. This year there were 2,000, which the state comptroller's office concedes is a \"substantial decline.\" On those missing returns, the government collects 6.25% of nothing. Instead of the state coffers gaining the extra $106 million the politicians predicted, millionaires paid $100 million less in taxes than they did last year -- even at higher rates. No doubt the majority of that loss in millionaire filings results from the recession. However, this is one reason that depending on the rich to finance government is so ill-advised: Progressive tax rates create mountains of cash during good times that vanish during recessions. For evidence, consult California, New York and New Jersey (see here). The Maryland state revenue office says it's \"way too early\" to tell how many millionaires moved out of the state when the tax rates rose. But no one disputes that some rich filers did leave.

GG so much for freedom. How about this instead of spending more money how about people balance their budget and make people dig themselves out. This is freaking rediculous.

Governor Martin O'Malley, a dedicated class warrior, declared that these richest 0.3% of filers were \"willing and able to pay their fair share.\" The Baltimore Sun predicted the rich would \"grin and bear it.\" One year later, nobody's grinning. One-third of the millionaires have disappeared from Maryland tax rolls. In 2008 roughly 3,000 million-dollar income tax returns were filed by the end of April. This year there were 2,000, which the state comptroller's office concedes is a \"substantial decline.\" On those missing returns, the government collects 6.25% of nothing. Instead of the state coffers gaining the extra $106 million the politicians predicted, millionaires paid $100 million less in taxes than they did last year -- even at higher rates. No doubt the majority of that loss in millionaire filings results from the recession. However, this is one reason that depending on the rich to finance government is so ill-advised: Progressive tax rates create mountains of cash during good times that vanish during recessions. For evidence, consult California, New York and New Jersey (see here). The Maryland state revenue office says it's \"way too early\" to tell how many millionaires moved out of the state when the tax rates rose. But no one disputes that some rich filers did leave. It's easier than the redistributionists think. Christopher Summers, president of the Maryland Public Policy Institute, notes: \"Marylanders with high incomes typically own second homes in tax friendlier states like Florida, Delaware, South Carolina and Virginia.

There is class warfare in America, choose a side, you can listen to the propaganda put out by the churches and talk radio or you can use your brain and realize you have been screwed royally by the rich and powerful.",

GG so much for freedom. How about this instead of spending more money how about people balance their budget and make people dig themselves out. This is freaking rediculous. By your thinking its the Government that deserves that money. Well they don't. They don't own those businesses. The government didn't come up with the ideas and drive those people to succeed. This is straight up a travesty of all I've spent my entire adult life defending.",

And because cities such as Baltimore and Bethesda also impose income taxes, the state-local tax rate can go as high as 9.45%. Governor Martin O'Malley, a dedicated class warrior, declared that these richest 0.3% of filers were \"willing and able to pay their fair share.\" The Baltimore Sun predicted the rich would \"grin and bear it.\" One year later, nobody's grinning. One-third of the millionaires have disappeared from Maryland tax rolls. In 2008 roughly 3,000 million-dollar income tax returns were filed by the end of April. This year there were 2,000, which the state comptroller's office concedes is a \"substantial decline.\" On those missing returns, the government collects 6.25% of nothing. Instead of the state coffers gaining the extra $106 million the politicians predicted, millionaires paid $100 million less in taxes than they did last year -- even at higher rates. No doubt the majority of that loss in millionaire filings results from the recession. However, this is one reason that depending on the rich to finance government is so ill-advised: Progressive tax rates create mountains of cash during good times that vanish during recessions. For evidence, consult California, New York and New Jersey (see here). The Maryland state revenue office says it's \"way too early\" to tell how many millionaires moved out of the state when the tax rates rose. But no one disputes that some rich filers did leave. It's easier than the redistributionists think. Christopher Summers, president of the Maryland Public Policy Institute, notes: \"Marylanders with high incomes typically own second homes in tax friendlier states like Florida, Delaware, South Carolina and Virginia.

And I always wondered why O'Malley was elected in the first place as he did not much of anything for Baltimore. Ah, the wisdom of those in the state which I live.",

Those stimulus dollars just moved to another state. Good for them. quote: Here's a two-minute drill in soak-the-rich economics: Maryland couldn't balance its budget last year, so the state tried to close the shortfall by fleecing the wealthy. Politicians in Annapolis created a millionaire tax bracket, raising the top marginal income-tax rate to 6.25%. And because cities such as Baltimore and Bethesda also impose income taxes, the state-local tax rate can go as high as 9.45%. Governor Martin O'Malley, a dedicated class warrior, declared that these richest 0.3% of filers were \"willing and able to pay their fair share.\" The Baltimore Sun predicted the rich would \"grin and bear it.\" One year later, nobody's grinning. One-third of the millionaires have disappeared from Maryland tax rolls. In 2008 roughly 3,000 million-dollar income tax returns were filed by the end of April. This year there were 2,000, which the state comptroller's office concedes is a \"substantial decline.\" On those missing returns, the government collects 6.25% of nothing. Instead of the state coffers gaining the extra $106 million the politicians predicted, millionaires paid $100 million less in taxes than they did last year -- even at higher rates. No doubt the majority of that loss in millionaire filings results from the recession. However, this is one reason that depending on the rich to finance government is so ill-advised: Progressive tax rates create mountains of cash during good times that vanish during recessions. For evidence, consult California, New York and New Jersey (see here). The Maryland state revenue office says it's \"way too early\" to tell how many millionaires moved out of the state when the tax rates rose. But no one disputes that some rich filers did leave. It's easier than the redistributionists think.
