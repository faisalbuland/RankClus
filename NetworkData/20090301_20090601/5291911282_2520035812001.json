Today a friend of mine for the past 43 years was invited to shoot our weapons on my Son's best friends 1800 acre property. I brought my 45 and 22 long riffle, Chip, my friend brought his two guns, Tony had three and my son has his old enfield. Once we started shooting Tony's cell phone started ringing and before you knew it about 5 or 6 more people showed up with AK's, M-16's, 9mm, 7mm, you name it they had it. I talked to a few of the guys after we stopped for a while and I was trying to have some fun with them as I do with you all here but soon I found out that if you start talking about Obama and the rest of the Motley crew they get as serious as two Rangers in a fox hole being over run by a battalion of VC. I sure don't want to be around when they try to take their guns away. These guys had tree stands in the woods so far back that you had to have an ATV and then you had to walk a mile to get there. One guy, I swear, had about 12 guns and enough ammo to start a war in DC. They all know each other, they have commo, food, generators, Heck one guy had a condo he build with AC and a TV in it out in the middle of a swamp. He invited me over in July to go snake hunting with him. Last year he said he killed 97 water moccasins and rattle snakes. Thats enough for now but to some they may be rednecks but to me they are good ole boys who just want to be left alone and are proud of their country and what they have.",

Today a friend of mine for the past 43 years was invited to shoot our weapons on my Son's best friends 1800 acre property. I brought my 45 and 22 long riffle, Chip, my friend brought his two guns, Tony had three and my son has his old enfield. Once we started shooting Tony's cell phone started ringing and before you knew it about 5 or 6 more people showed up with AK's, M-16's, 9mm, 7mm, you name it they had it. I talked to a few of the guys after we stopped for a while and I was trying to have some fun with them as I do with you all here but soon I found out that if you start talking about Obama and the rest of the Motley crew they get as serious as two Rangers in a fox hole being over run by a battalion of VC. I sure don't want to be around when they try to take their guns away. These guys had tree stands in the woods so far back that you had to have an ATV and then you had to walk a mile to get there. One guy, I swear, had about 12 guns and enough ammo to start a war in DC. They all know each other, they have commo, food, generators, Heck one guy had a condo he build with AC and a TV in it out in the middle of a swamp. He invited me over in July to go snake hunting with him. Last year he said he killed 97 water moccasins and rattle snakes. Thats enough for now but to some they may be rednecks but to me they are good ole boys who just want to be left alone and are proud of their country and what they have.",
