Only two Democrats voted with McCain: Evan Bayh and Claire McCaskill. There were eight Republicans who voted against McCain, thereby supporting the earmarks and the higher levels of spending.

The amendment that was just rejected would have jettisoned the omnibus bill and frozen spending levels. The Senate will continue debating the omnibus bill throughout much of this week; Republicans are pointing to overlap between the $787 billion stimulus package of a few weeks ago and spending provisions for some agencies in this carryover bill. Even Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t optimistic this morning that his proposal had a shot, despite his efforts to juxtapose the dire straits of the American economy with a seemingly endless list of earmarks ranging from improving blueberry production in Georgia to financing a study of pig odor in Iowa. Again today, he called for President Obama to veto the omnibus spending bill once it\u2019s passed, to take out his veto pen. \u201cThe last guy should\u2019ve taken out his veto pen,\u201d Mr. McCain said of former President Bush, without mentioning his name. \u201cHe should\u2019ve.

Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, leads the list among those specifically requested by individual lawmakers. Two Democrats, Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, voted with 30 Republicans for the amendment.

Awkward when I disagree with party leadership but I really think McCain is right on this one.\u201d Senator McCain\u2019s tweets today so far list another Top Ten list of earmarks. (He\u2019s been sending out lists for several days. Today\u2019s so far includes: *$819, 000 for catfish genetics research in Alabama *$190,000 for the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyo. *$400,000 for copper wire theft prevention efforts *$47,500 to remodel and expand a playground in Ottawa, Ill. *$209,000 for blueberry production in Georgia\u2026 *$285,000 for the Discovery Center of Idaho in Boise \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
