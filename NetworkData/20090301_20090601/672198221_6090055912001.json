In a private ceremony with Queen Elizabeth, Her Royal Highness bequeathed to the Obamas one of the earliest known copies of William Shakespeare's Henry V. She also presented him with the framed orginal sheet music of John Newton's \"Amazing Grace.\" To the Obama daughters, the Queen gave a dollhouse-sized replica of Windsor Castle with a functioning train station in the year of the compound. They also received a prize Shetland pony. Mrs. Obama was given a ruby ring commissioned and worn by Queen Victoria. The Obamas, unfortunately, did not seem prepared for the occasion despite the row set off by the exchange of gifts between Prime Minister Brown and the U.S. President barely a month ago. Mr. Obama rather unceremoniously handed the Queen a shopping bag from the Duty Free shop at Heathrow airport. It contained a signed paperback copy of Dreams of My Father, purchased at the WH Smith shop at the airport, a bottle of Johnny Walker Scotch (black label), a CD of the Swedish band ABBA's greatest hits (still in shrink wrap with a 2-for-1 sticker on it) and ten bags of M&Ms with the presidential seal on them.

Obama's iPod gift includes 40 Broadway show tunes By The Associated Press \u2013 1 hour ago President Barack Obama's gift of an iPod to Queen Elizabeth II came loaded with 40 songs from popular Broadway productions, including \"The King and I,\" \"West Side Story\" and \"Dreamgirls.\" The iPod was given to accompany a rare coffee table book of songs by composers Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, which Obama also gave the queen. Songs on the iPod are: \"Oklahoma!\" \"If I Loved You,\" Jan Clayton, \"Carousel\" \"You'll Never Walk Alone,\" Jan Clayton, \"Carousel\" \"There's No Business Like Show Business,\" Ethel Merman, \"Annie Get Your Gun\" \"Once in Love with Amy (Where's Charley?),\" Ray Bolger \"Some Enchanted Evening,\" \"South Pacific\" \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,\" Carol Channing, \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" \"Getting to Know You,\" Gertrude Lawrence, \"The King and I\" \"Shall We Dance?\" Gertrude Lawrence, \"The King and I\" \"I Could Have Danced All Night,\" Julie Andrews, \"My Fair Lady\" \"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,\" Rex Harrison, \"My Fair Lady\" \"The Party's Over (Bells Are Ringing),\" Judy Holliday \"Maria,\" \"West Side Story\" \"Tonight,\" \"West Side Story\" \"Seventy Six Trombones,\" \"The Music Man\" \"Everything's Coming up Roses,\" Ethel Merman, \"Gypsy\" \"The Sound of Music\" \"Try to Remember,\" Jerry Orbach, \"The Fantasticks\" \"Camelot,\" Richard Burton \"If Ever I Would Leave You,\" Robert Goulet, \"Camelot\" \"Hello, Dolly!\" Carol Channing \"If I Were a Rich Man,\" Zero Mostel, \"Fiddler on the Roof\" \"People,\" Barbra Streisand, \"Funny Girl\" \"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever),\" John Cullum \"The Impossible Dream,\" Richard Kiley, \"Man of La Mancha\" \"Mame,\" Charles Braswell \"Cabaret,\" Liza Minnelli \"Aquarius, Ronald Dyson, \"Hair' \"Send in the Clowns,\" Judy Collins, \"A Little Night Music\" \"All That Jazz,\" Chita Rivera, \"Chicago\" \"One,\" \"A Chorus Line\" \"Tomorrow,\" Andrea McArdle, \"Annie\" \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina,\" Patti LuPone, \"Evita\" \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,\" Jennifer Holliday, \"Dreamgirls\" \"Memory,\" Elaine Paige, \"Cats\" \"The Best of Times,\" George Hearn, \"La Cage Aux Folles\" \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" Aretha Franklin, \"Les Miserables\" \"The Music of the Night,\" Michael Crawford, \"The Phantom of the Opera\" \"As If We Never Said Goodbye,\" Elaine Paige, \"Sunset Blvd.\" \"Seasons of Love,\" \"Rent\" http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jYUcmwGRA3ma_hwjWQq7EagwYiTwD979UI2G1 Seems the iPod may have been meant to enhance the gift of the 'rare book', but Goldberg failed to mention this in his article at the National Review.

The Obamas, unfortunately, did not seem prepared for the occasion despite the row set off by the exchange of gifts between Prime Minister Brown and the U.S. President barely a month ago. Mr. Obama rather unceremoniously handed the Queen a shopping bag from the Duty Free shop at Heathrow airport. It contained a signed paperback copy of Dreams of My Father, purchased at the WH Smith shop at the airport, a bottle of Johnny Walker Scotch (black label), a CD of the Swedish band ABBA's greatest hits (still in shrink wrap with a 2-for-1 sticker on it) and ten bags of M&Ms with the presidential seal on them. The Queen responded in a rather flat: \"How delightful.\" \"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODA4ZDQ0ODNiMGJkZTY2OWYyY2YzMmE2NTdhZThmMDE=\"",
