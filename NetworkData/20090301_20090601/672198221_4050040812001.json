This is not to attempt to argue that she should be elevated to a leadership position (although all things considered what harm could it do?) but rather that unless conservatives broaden their message they should expect their time on the back benches to be long term and possibly permanent. I suspect Ingraham and Limbaugh make more money than all the posters on mil.com.

Memo to Meghan McCain: Enjoy the media coverage while it lasts, but know you're being used. You are the flavor of the month in left-wing media land because you are a Republican bashing the GOP. Likewise, your dad is most popular among the same people when he is slamming his Republican brethren in full-blown \"maverick\" fashion. At least he backs up his views with a lifetime of sacrifice and public service. What is Ms. McCain's own political, business, or real-world experience that lends credibility to her argument that the GOP needs to \"moderate\" (read: abandon its core principles)? \" \"http://www.lauraingraham.com/\" Seems to me she is now displaying how the republican party really felt about John McCain. It's too bad John flip flopped over to the far right, I could have voted for him had he stayed where he was and didn't put on a show for the Reps. I believe the point Meghan McCain is making is that for people in her age category individuals like Coulter, Limbaugh and Ingraham are essentially irrelevant. Survey after survey has demonstrated that a substantial number of those under 40 do not like Limbaugh. Who can blame them, why should they pay any heed to some blathering fool who is so obviously incapable of speaking to them. The same is true of Coulter and Ingraham - neither has a message designed to pique the interest of the younger crowd. If the Republican Party was led by individuals with insight and vision (like that will ever happen in this life!!) they would discount the Coulters and embrace people like Meghan McCain.
