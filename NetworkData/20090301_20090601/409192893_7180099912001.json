Washington is seeking \"broad engagement\" with Muslim countries, he said, adding: \"We will listen carefully, bridge misunderstanding... We will be respectful, even when we do not agree.\" Obama announced he would unveil in the coming months \"specific programmes\" to enhance education and health care and boost prosperity in Muslim countries by expanding trade and investment. Addressing Iran, Turkey's eastern neighbour, Obama warned that the Islamic republic has to make a choice between having a nuclear weapon and building a better future for its people. \"I have made it clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic that the United States seeks engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect,\" he said. \"Now, Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people.\" The US president also voiced support for peace efforts in the Middle East, backing both the Annapolis agreement and the stalled roadmap that laid out the route to Israeli-Palestinian peace. His remarks came after Israel's new Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week the 2007 Annapolis document did not bind Israel though he did accept the roadmap as the basis for progress. \"Let me be clear: the United States strongly supports the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security,\" Obama said. \"That is a goal shared by Palestinians, Israelis, and people of goodwill around the world. \"That is a goal that the parties agreed to in the roadmap and at Annapolis. And that is a goal that I will actively pursue as president,\" he said. I guess he didn't read the 9-11 report... History is littered with the corpses of those not strong enough or smart enough to defend themselves. We are walking blindly down that road. Under Obama we will become less then a super power. We will lose the ability to project force and defend our ideals.",

Washington is seeking \"broad engagement\" with Muslim countries, he said, adding: \"We will listen carefully, bridge misunderstanding... We will be respectful, even when we do not agree.\" Obama announced he would unveil in the coming months \"specific programmes\" to enhance education and health care and boost prosperity in Muslim countries by expanding trade and investment. Addressing Iran, Turkey's eastern neighbour, Obama warned that the Islamic republic has to make a choice between having a nuclear weapon and building a better future for its people. \"I have made it clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic that the United States seeks engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect,\" he said. \"Now, Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people.\" The US president also voiced support for peace efforts in the Middle East, backing both the Annapolis agreement and the stalled roadmap that laid out the route to Israeli-Palestinian peace. His remarks came after Israel's new Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week the 2007 Annapolis document did not bind Israel though he did accept the roadmap as the basis for progress. \"Let me be clear: the United States strongly supports the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security,\" Obama said. \"That is a goal shared by Palestinians, Israelis, and people of goodwill around the world. \"That is a goal that the parties agreed to in the roadmap and at Annapolis. And that is a goal that I will actively pursue as president,\" he said. I guess he didn't read the 9-11 report... History is littered with the corpses of those not strong enough or smart enough to defend themselves. We are walking blindly down that road. Under Obama we will become less then a super power. We will lose the ability to project force and defend our ideals.",

Washington is seeking \"broad engagement\" with Muslim countries, he said, adding: \"We will listen carefully, bridge misunderstanding... We will be respectful, even when we do not agree.\" Obama announced he would unveil in the coming months \"specific programmes\" to enhance education and health care and boost prosperity in Muslim countries by expanding trade and investment. Addressing Iran, Turkey's eastern neighbour, Obama warned that the Islamic republic has to make a choice between having a nuclear weapon and building a better future for its people. \"I have made it clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic that the United States seeks engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect,\" he said. \"Now, Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people.\" The US president also voiced support for peace efforts in the Middle East, backing both the Annapolis agreement and the stalled roadmap that laid out the route to Israeli-Palestinian peace. His remarks came after Israel's new Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week the 2007 Annapolis document did not bind Israel though he did accept the roadmap as the basis for progress. \"Let me be clear: the United States strongly supports the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security,\" Obama said. \"That is a goal shared by Palestinians, Israelis, and people of goodwill around the world. \"That is a goal that the parties agreed to in the roadmap and at Annapolis. And that is a goal that I will actively pursue as president,\" he said. I guess he didn't read the 9-11 report... History is littered with the corpses of those not strong enough or smart enough to defend themselves. We are walking blindly down that road. Under Obama we will become less then a super power. We will lose the ability to project force and defend our ideals. We have overextended ourselves militarily. It is for this reason that we will lose the ability to project force around the world. We were already going to become less than a superpower. Due to recent events, that day will just roll around sooner. Is it really such a bad thing? I mean, I don't think realistically, with the size and training and experience of our military, we will be unable to defend ourselves. Or even or actual allies (NATO mostly.)
