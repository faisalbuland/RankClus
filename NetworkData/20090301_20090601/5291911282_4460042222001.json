She said, \"Lord, you seem to be having a lot of trouble with this one. What's the matter with the standard model?\" The Lord replied, \"Have you seen the specs on this order? She has to be completely independent, posses the qualities of both father and mother, be a perfect hostess to four or forty with an hour's notice, run on black coffee, handle every emergency imaginable without a manual, be able to carry on cheerfully, ever if she's pregnant and has the flu, and she must be willing to move 10 times in 17 years. And oh, yes, she must have six pairs of hands.\" The angel shook her head. \"Six pairs of hands? No way!\" The Lord continued, \"Don't worry, we shall make other military wives to help her. And we will give her an unusually strong heart so it can swell with pride in her husband's achievements, sustain the pain of separations, beat soundly when it's over-worked and tired, and be large enough to say 'I understand,' when she does not, and say 'I love you,' regardless.\" The angel circled the model of the military wife, looked at it closely and sighed, \"It looks fine, but it's too soft.\" \"She might look soft,\" replied the Lord, \"but she has the strength of a lion. You would not believe what she can endure.\" Finally, the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek of the Lord's creation. \"There's a leak,\" she announced. \"Something is wrong with the construction. I am not surprised that it has cracked. You are trying to put too much into this model.\" The Lord appeared offended at the angel's lack of confidence. What you see is not a leak,\" he said. \"It's a tear.\" \"A tear? What is it there for?\" asked the angel. The Lord replied, \"It's for joy sadness, pain, disappointment, loneliness, pride and a dedication to all the values that she and her husband hold dear.\" \"You are a genius!\" exclaimed the angel. The Lord looked puzzled and replied, \"I didn't put it there.\"",

I am posting it here for you clio, as I think it's always the little things you have to work the hardest at in a military marriage. I don't know if he will be able to enlist or not. But, always remember that. If he does, the USMC is bigger then both of you, and will become a huge part of both your lives. I wrote this for a contest on military spouses, then realized it was for active duty only. But I thought maybe some of you might want to see it, plus, I wanted to brag about my wife to you. My Hero I am writing this, because there is someone in my life, that gives me strength, and is the person who gets me through the tough times. My wife Debbie, is a husbands dream. I will give you some background on her and why she is THE best military spouse a man could have. I am in the Navy reserves, as a Seabee. In 2003, my Air-Det was deployed to Iraq. And again in 2007-08. I understand that thousands of active duty spouses go through this on a regular basis, but my wife had several strikes against her. We had just moved to a new house a few months previous, when I got my warning order. A new town, a 4 year old son, a six month old daughter, and a 16 year old step -daughter, that my ex-wife decided she couldn\u2019t handle about 2 months before I deployed. If this wasn\u2019t enough, as a reservist, she wasn\u2019t sure of military support or structure. Deb wouldn\u2019t know if I was an E-1 in the Air Force or a General in the Marines. (I am a Chief in the Navy). That has no interest to her. What she finds important, is that I am doing a much needed job and, she has supported me in my military endeavors. During both of my deployments to OIF, she was my rock. While running the gamut of emotions overseas, there were always things that I could count on. I knew my kids were being taken well care of, the house was going to be still standing, and I would have money in the bank. Those sound like small things, but we have all heard horror stories of troops returning home to absent spouses and no money. When I would find myself outside the wire, and things seemed hopeless or bleak, I would always think of Debbie, and how she is so tough, and I would continue to persevere. I was in charge of a 28 man convoy security team. Several times, I had guys on my team, tell me they wished their spouse/significant other was more like Deb. Not because she is beautiful, she is, but because of her attitude and demeanor. That feeling of pride is un-paralleled. People often call me and other service people their heroes. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong. We do a rough job, that needs doing, but we know the consequences and rewards. Spouses generally, and Deb specifically, do it to no fanfare or applause. Deb is my hero and my life. If I died today, my life would have been a success. She let me into her life and has honored me by sharing it with me. She is my wife, lover, confidant, and my best friend",

I wrote this for a contest on military spouses, then realized it was for active duty only. But I thought maybe some of you might want to see it, plus, I wanted to brag about my wife to you. My Hero I am writing this, because there is someone in my life, that gives me strength, and is the person who gets me through the tough times. My wife Debbie, is a husbands dream. I will give you some background on her and why she is THE best military spouse a man could have. I am in the Navy reserves, as a Seabee. In 2003, my Air-Det was deployed to Iraq. And again in 2007-08. I understand that thousands of active duty spouses go through this on a regular basis, but my wife had several strikes against her. We had just moved to a new house a few months previous, when I got my warning order. A new town, a 4 year old son, a six month old daughter, and a 16 year old step -daughter, that my ex-wife decided she couldn\u2019t handle about 2 months before I deployed. If this wasn\u2019t enough, as a reservist, she wasn\u2019t sure of military support or structure. Deb wouldn\u2019t know if I was an E-1 in the Air Force or a General in the Marines. (I am a Chief in the Navy). That has no interest to her. What she finds important, is that I am doing a much needed job and, she has supported me in my military endeavors. During both of my deployments to OIF, she was my rock. While running the gamut of emotions overseas, there were always things that I could count on. I knew my kids were being taken well care of, the house was going to be still standing, and I would have money in the bank. Those sound like small things, but we have all heard horror stories of troops returning home to absent spouses and no money. When I would find myself outside the wire, and things seemed hopeless or bleak, I would always think of Debbie, and how she is so tough, and I would continue to persevere. I was in charge of a 28 man convoy security team. Several times, I had guys on my team, tell me they wished their spouse/significant other was more like Deb. Not because she is beautiful, she is, but because of her attitude and demeanor. That feeling of pride is un-paralleled. People often call me and other service people their heroes. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong. We do a rough job, that needs doing, but we know the consequences and rewards. Spouses generally, and Deb specifically, do it to no fanfare or applause. Deb is my hero and my life. If I died today, my life would have been a success. She let me into her life and has honored me by sharing it with me. She is my wife, lover, confidant, and my best friend",

You're not ready to be a military wife. No offense at all, miss. But some are just not cut out for it. You swayed him to back out of his contract, and now he'll never fulfill his dream. But you got what you wanted. Congratulations. The answer is no - the military will never take him for stepping out of his initial contract. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

        "content": "quote: cllopez310 They may not let him join now. Marines have always been strict about disqualifying people. And all the services are getting stricter now that the economy is down and recruiting numbers are up. They can afford to pick and choose who will serve. They may be unwilling to trust signing on a person who has backed out of a commitment before, without some very good family reasons. It also depends on how he backed out. Did he call up the recruiter and inform him, or did he just not show up? Simply not showing up is considered a dishonorable thing to do, and would not help his case. I wish you and him the best of luck. But remember, the military requires a lot of people, both those who serve, and their spouses and children back home. Your fear is understandable. The military asks not that you have no fear, but that you never let fear dictate or decide your actions.",
