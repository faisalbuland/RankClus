I was NOT IMPRESSED. I'll stick with Wallyworld... I am glad someone brought up the question of \"what a living wage is\". Of course I will most certainly offer my definition of that term and why I feel that way. If you had asked me 200 years ago what a living wage was, I would have thought you were nuts because we didn't need \"fed\" backed money wages back then. Our wages came from the work that we done for ourselves to ensure our families survival. Our wages came from the WORD of one neighbors hand shake to anothers, our wages came from farming, hunting, fishing, building shelter and so on. Now, today, most people do not have the luxury of stomping across their neighbors land to hunt for food or shelter in order to survive. Ironically it is the Capital Religious people (Republicans) that have us all in the position that we HAVE to have money in order to eat, breath and maintain a habitable shelter and any sub system that will support human life. This does not include Cable TV, Cell Phones, Internet or anything else that is not absolutely essential to sustain life. It does however include what a person needs to meet the constitutional RIGHTS we were all guaranteed of Life Liberty and the Pursuit Of Happiness. No we do not want to see people get rich off a minuet job, but we should always guarantee all of our fellow citizens a CHANCE at living the way they want too. But that does not include abusing systems that are meant to help people stand on their own 2 feet. That I agree there is too much of and needs to stop one way or another. But then again, when you guys supporting Bush and his company bailout, it tends to place me in the position of wanting to help individuals with bailouts as well. A living wage is a RIGHT. But a RIGHT is only good if one is RESPONSIBLE enough to ensure that they do not abuse that right.",

Our wages came from the WORD of one neighbors hand shake to anothers, our wages came from farming, hunting, fishing, building shelter and so on. Now, today, most people do not have the luxury of stomping across their neighbors land to hunt for food or shelter in order to survive. Ironically it is the Capital Religious people (Republicans) that have us all in the position that we HAVE to have money in order to eat, breath and maintain a habitable shelter and any sub system that will support human life. This does not include Cable TV, Cell Phones, Internet or anything else that is not absolutely essential to sustain life. It does however include what a person needs to meet the constitutional RIGHTS we were all guaranteed of Life Liberty and the Pursuit Of Happiness. No we do not want to see people get rich off a minuet job, but we should always guarantee all of our fellow citizens a CHANCE at living the way they want too. But that does not include abusing systems that are meant to help people stand on their own 2 feet. That I agree there is too much of and needs to stop one way or another. But then again, when you guys supporting Bush and his company bailout, it tends to place me in the position of wanting to help individuals with bailouts as well. A living wage is a RIGHT. But a RIGHT is only good if one is RESPONSIBLE enough to ensure that they do not abuse that right.",

From A Proud Vietnam Veteran When the minimum wage law was passed over 70 years ago, it was a Living Wage. A Living Wage means that a job pays enough for food, shelter, transportation and clothing. The bare necessities of life. Yet on THIS board I've been told that if we once again make the minimum wage a Living Wage, then items that cost a dollar will suddenly cost ten dollars. Well now, as Costco proves, such is not the case. If they are more expensive than Walmart (and I don't know one way or the other) than their paying a MINIMUM of almost twice as mush as Walmarts AVERAGE wage, makes that argument completely false. One might as well argue that Walmart should buy and use slaves so that we can save ANOTHER dollar on a purchase, and that we should patronise them BECAUSE they use slave labor. Reward Walmart? Reward them for what? Might as well buy stolen goods for less than Walmart charges and praise the thief for giving you such a bargain. Dave",

Choosing between a company like Walmart or a company like Costco, is NOT choosing between Liberals and Conservatives. It's choosing between a company that does NOT pay its employee's enough to live on, and a company that does. Are you saying that it IS a choice between \"Liberal\" and \"Conservative?\" There are many who say that Walmart has hit on a \"winning\" model to run a buisness. Paying starvation wages is actually a pretty old model. Some of us simply call it \"exploitation.\" taking advantage of the fact that there are fewer and fewer jobs around thay pay enough to live on. But I wonder, if Walmarts \"model\" becomes the model for all American companies, just who is going to restart what has become a consumer economy? Maybe we will all soon learn the thrill of living in a Third World Country. With a few extremely wealthy living in gated communites, what's left of the Middle class struggling to survive, and a mass of \"happy poor people\" ready to do anything at all to survive. In my neighborhood, I get to see many Europeans and Asians tourists, who in turn watch the \"quaint\" activities of the \"natives.\" As we continue to spiral downward (but slowly, slowly) I expect to see this more common. Almost heart warming wouldn't you say? This thread has been an eye opener for me. Not that I learned anything about Walmart, but I did learn that there ARE companies in America that actually believe that even if you pay a decent wage you can make a profit. True, this kind of model can be considered \"subversive.\" Who knows? If this kind of business model spreads, we simply wont become a Third World nation - What a tragedy! Dave",

Thus People remain in a Job During a Recesssion; and \"foreclosure on their homes are often avoided! Just My Opinion! From A Proud Vietnam Veteran When the minimum wage law was passed over 70 years ago, it was a Living Wage. A Living Wage means that a job pays enough for food, shelter, transportation and clothing. The bare necessities of life. Yet on THIS board I've been told that if we once again make the minimum wage a Living Wage, then items that cost a dollar will suddenly cost ten dollars. Well now, as Costco proves, such is not the case. If they are more expensive than Walmart (and I don't know one way or the other) than their paying a MINIMUM of almost twice as mush as Walmarts AVERAGE wage, makes that argument completely false. One might as well argue that Walmart should buy and use slaves so that we can save ANOTHER dollar on a purchase, and that we should patronise them BECAUSE they use slave labor. Reward Walmart? Reward them for what? Might as well buy stolen goods for less than Walmart charges and praise the thief for giving you such a bargain. Dave",

Choosing between a company like Walmart or a company like Costco, is NOT choosing between Liberals and Conservatives. It's choosing between a company that does NOT pay its employee's enough to live on, and a company that does. Are you saying that it IS a choice between \"Liberal\" and \"Conservative?\" There are many who say that Walmart has hit on a \"winning\" model to run a buisness. Paying starvation wages is actually a pretty old model. Some of us simply call it \"exploitation.\" taking advantage of the fact that there are fewer and fewer jobs around thay pay enough to live on. But I wonder, if Walmarts \"model\" becomes the model for all American companies, just who is going to restart what has become a consumer economy? Maybe we will all soon learn the thrill of living in a Third World Country. With a few extremely wealthy living in gated communites, what's left of the Middle class struggling to survive, and a mass of \"happy poor people\" ready to do anything at all to survive. In my neighborhood, I get to see many Europeans and Asians tourists, who in turn watch the \"quaint\" activities of the \"natives.\" As we continue to spiral downward (but slowly, slowly) I expect to see this more common. Almost heart warming wouldn't you say? This thread has been an eye opener for me. Not that I learned anything about Walmart, but I did learn that there ARE companies in America that actually believe that even if you pay a decent wage you can make a profit. True, this kind of model can be considered \"subversive.\" Who knows? If this kind of business model spreads, we simply wont become a Third World nation - What a tragedy! Dave",

From A Proud Vietnam Veteran When the minimum wage law was passed over 70 years ago, it was a Living Wage. A Living Wage means that a job pays enough for food, shelter, transportation and clothing. The bare necessities of life. Yet on THIS board I've been told that if we once again make the minimum wage a Living Wage, then items that cost a dollar will suddenly cost ten dollars. Well now, as Costco proves, such is not the case. If they are more expensive than Walmart (and I don't know one way or the other) than their paying a MINIMUM of almost twice as mush as Walmarts AVERAGE wage, makes that argument completely false. One might as well argue that Walmart should buy and use slaves so that we can save ANOTHER dollar on a purchase, and that we should patronise them BECAUSE they use slave labor. Reward Walmart? Reward them for what? Might as well buy stolen goods for less than Walmart charges and praise the thief for giving you such a bargain. Dave",

Choosing between a company like Walmart or a company like Costco, is NOT choosing between Liberals and Conservatives. It's choosing between a company that does NOT pay its employee's enough to live on, and a company that does. Are you saying that it IS a choice between \"Liberal\" and \"Conservative?\" There are many who say that Walmart has hit on a \"winning\" model to run a buisness. Paying starvation wages is actually a pretty old model. Some of us simply call it \"exploitation.\" taking advantage of the fact that there are fewer and fewer jobs around thay pay enough to live on. But I wonder, if Walmarts \"model\" becomes the model for all American companies, just who is going to restart what has become a consumer economy? Maybe we will all soon learn the thrill of living in a Third World Country. With a few extremely wealthy living in gated communites, what's left of the Middle class struggling to survive, and a mass of \"happy poor people\" ready to do anything at all to survive. In my neighborhood, I get to see many Europeans and Asians tourists, who in turn watch the \"quaint\" activities of the \"natives.\" As we continue to spiral downward (but slowly, slowly) I expect to see this more common. Almost heart warming wouldn't you say? This thread has been an eye opener for me. Not that I learned anything about Walmart, but I did learn that there ARE companies in America that actually believe that even if you pay a decent wage you can make a profit. True, this kind of model can be considered \"subversive.\" Who knows? If this kind of business model spreads, we simply wont become a Third World nation - What a tragedy! Dave",
