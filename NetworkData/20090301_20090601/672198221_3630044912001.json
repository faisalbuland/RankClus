Actually if you bother to look at what is ACTUALLY happening it looks like Mr. Obama favors GM going through a fast (prearraigned) bankrupcy, where most of the issues are agreed before the start. The reason the CEO was ASKED to leave was that GM management had NOT developed a plan to make GM viable in the specified time to get Government help and was unwilling to go straight to bankrupcy and in the negotiations with stake holders (bond holders, stock holders, etc.) specifically ruled out bankrupcy as an option (which meant the stake holders had no incentive to compromise). GM management was unwilling or unable to do anything about the Bond holders, Dealer contracts and the Stock holders, the plan they submitted was mostly just to break Union contracts and close plants which would NOT have been enough to give the compnay a chance.

The largest portion of Obamas bailout trillions goes to corporate big wigs and not to the consumer that could stimulate the economy!
