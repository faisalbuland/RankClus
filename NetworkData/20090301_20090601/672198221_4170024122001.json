WUSA-TV and WTOP Radio reported that David Kellermann was found dead in his Northern Virginia home. The 41-year-old Kellermann has been Freddie Mac's chief financial officer since September. Sabrina Ruck, a Fairfax County police spokesman, confirmed to The Associated Press that Kellermann was dead, but she could not confirm that he committed suicide. Kellermann's death is the latest blow to Freddie Mac, a government controlled company that owns or guarantees about 13 million home loans. CEO David Moffett resigned last month. McLean, Va.-based Freddie Mac and sibling company Fannie Mae, which together own or back more than half of the home mortgages in the country, have been hobbled by skyrocketing loan defaults and have received about $60 billion in combined federal aid. Kellermann was named acting chief financial officer in September 2008, after the resignation of Anthony \"Buddy\" Piszel, who stepped down after the September 2008 government takeover. The chief financial officer is responsible for the company's financial controls, financial reporting and oversight of the company's budget and financial planning. Before taking that job, Kellerman served as senior vice president, corporate controller and principal accounting officer. He was with Freddie Mac for more than 16 years. \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,517399,00.html\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

Fairfax County Police spokeswoman Mary Anne Jennings says Kellermann, 41, was found at his Hunter Mill Estates home Wednesday morning. Jennings says police responded to the home after family members called police around 5 a.m. \"We were called from inside the house to come investigate an apparent suicide,\" Jennings says. Because of legal ramifications, Jennings says she can't describe the nature of the suicide. \"We're not to give you details of the condition of the body, except to say it was an apparent suicide,\" Jennings says. A final determination that his death was a suicide will come from a medical examiner. Neighbors in the Vienna neighborhood where Kellermann lives tell WTOP they are surprised to hear about his suicide. Kellermann has been with Freddie Mac for more than 16 years. He was named acting chief financial officer of the agency in September 2008. He took over after Anthony \"Buddy\" Piszel resigned. As CFO, Kellermann is responsible for the company's financial controls, financial reporting and oversight of the company's budget and financial planning.
