One income family, my Aunt Fanny ... if she were deployed and he fired, they'd still have HER income - tax-free, I might add - as Plan B. Probably a drop in overall income, but income nevertheless. This woman - and her husband - knew what was what when they both signed their original enlistment papers. She served between 2-3 years, and had the remainder of her total 8 year service obligation to serve. As IRR, she was recallable at any time, except the times when she was pregnant and right after delivery (another two years there). She signed a contract and bailed on it. How many here have beyotched and complained when the Army/military/government doesn't keep it's end of a contract - for an MOS, training, assignment, whatever - yet never uttered a peep when an individual fails to honor his/her end of the deal? In the civilian world, she'd be fired, sued and discredited for failure to honor a contract ... yet people here are willing to give her a pass? I just don't get that at all. She's a disgrace to the thousands (or more) of service members, men and women, who have had equally difficult family situations, yet managed to scramble to find solutions AND meet their service obligations. This is one Army decision that embarrasses me through and through. It's a bad move, and she's set a horrible example for her own children - whine, cry and make a big enough stink about something you don't like/want to do, and you'll get away with not having to do it.

        "reply": "What if it were a FATHER wanting to stay home to take care of HIS children - different outcome? Hmmmm? One income family, my Aunt Fanny ... if she were deployed and he fired, they'd still have HER income - tax-free, I might add - as Plan B. Probably a drop in overall income, but income nevertheless. This woman - and her husband - knew what was what when they both signed their original enlistment papers. She served between 2-3 years, and had the remainder of her total 8 year service obligation to serve. As IRR, she was recallable at any time, except the times when she was pregnant and right after delivery (another two years there). She signed a contract and bailed on it. How many here have beyotched and complained when the Army/military/government doesn't keep it's end of a contract - for an MOS, training, assignment, whatever - yet never uttered a peep when an individual fails to honor his/her end of the deal? In the civilian world, she'd be fired, sued and discredited for failure to honor a contract ... yet people here are willing to give her a pass? I just don't get that at all. She's a disgrace to the thousands (or more) of service members, men and women, who have had equally difficult family situations, yet managed to scramble to find solutions AND meet their service obligations. This is one Army decision that embarrasses me through and through. It's a bad move, and she's set a horrible example for her own children - whine, cry and make a big enough stink about something you don't like/want to do, and you'll get away with not having to do it. Great family values, there.",

In fact, she made it a point to communicate all the details to the Army, such as their parents were not able to care for the children, her husband would be terminated for cause if he could not travel (employer told this to the Army in writing), etc. Seeing as they are a one-income family, this becomes a serious issue. Would you have her report for duty, deploy, have her husband terminated for cause, possibly become bankrupt and end up with the children as wards of the state in foster care because he could not take care of them? Army did the right thing when she showed up to release her, thank her for her service, and send her on her way. In this case, it was the lesser of the evils.",
