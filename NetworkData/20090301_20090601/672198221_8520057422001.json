He is the President. He has the authority to use those aircraft. He has a duty to also be a husband. And keep in mind that the President cannot just hop onto a commercial flight at his own expense and fly out to have a night on the town with his wife. For one thing, the Secret Service would not allow him to use a commercial airlines filled with other citizens. He legally used those aircraft, broke no laws in the use of them, committed no crimes in the use of the aircraft and did not violate any rules of etiquette and cooperated with the Secret Service. President Bush made that carrier landing, mission complete visit and no one here complained about what that cost the taxpayers. And by the way, President Obama and his wife were allowed an expenditure of about $100,000 to redecorate their living quarters. The President and his wife gave that money back to the taxpayers and redecorated at their own expense. And another thing, President Obama has requested a pay hike for military Chapter 61 retirees. Perhaps he was working on that while flying to Broadway with his wife. Frankly, I think he is setting a good example for all the young people by showing how much he respects and loves his wife. And if he wants to entertain his wife in New York rather than D.C., that is his perogative and no taxpayer has any say so in it. The only ones who have any say is the Secret Service and that is limited. The only ones complaining are the sour grapers.",
