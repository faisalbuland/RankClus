        "content": "I need to find someone who might have served with Juan in Da Nang in 1969. Juan died of hepatitis C in 2000. We had filed for benefits during his illness and I continued the claim after his death. VA has consistently denied he contracted Hep C while there, probably during a battle in September 1969 where he incurred injuries. The hospital records in Da Nang cannot be found and the VA says there is no proof that he received blood in the field or shared morphine injections because his unit was pinned down for some time. Apparently if I can find someone else who was there it could help. Please contact me if you have any information: Kathleen at: Use the send email option on karroyo21 profile page - personal emails are not allowed on military.com Thanks very much. We all hope that you are able to find the people needed to support the claim. Please keep us posted. This message has been edited. Last edited by: OldArmyLove, Fri 13 March 2009 02:05 PM",

        "content": "I'm Juan's wife. We found out he had hep C in 1998. At that point he had advanced cirrhosis and needed a new liver. He had been told he had some form of hepatitis while in Viet Nam. He was in the jungles for most of his tour and attributed the infection to being injured during combat. When he was dying he wrote a description of the conditions of the battleground, that he and most of his unit were injured, pinned down, he received blood on the field as well as shared morphine injections. He was injured again before his release and received two medals. However, because there is no record of actually receiving blood on the field or sharing of injections the VA has denied his claim for the last 10 years. He died in 2000 and I'd just as soon let this go but he made me promise to follow it through to the end. I'm hoping someone might have been there at the same time and could corroborate his story. I'm looking through records now so I can be more precise with what unit he was with. As most of you probably know, Juan did not like to talk about his experiences in Viet Nam and only told me because he needed to for the claim. I'll come back when/if I can get a better description of his unit. Thanks.",
