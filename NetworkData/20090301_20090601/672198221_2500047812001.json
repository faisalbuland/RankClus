The government at present has the authority to seize only banks. Giving the Treasury secretary authority over a broader range of companies would mark a significant shift from the existing model of financial regulation, which relies on independent agencies that are shielded from the political process. The Treasury secretary, a member of the president's Cabinet, would exercise the new powers in consultation with the White House, the Federal Reserve and other regulators, according to the document.

No wonder so many other countries hate us. Mr. Campanelli, My experience was that people overseas don't have any heartache with any of our financial institutions or practices. They don't care about internal power struggles in the American government. They don't even care which political party occupied the White House or held a majority in Congress. Why did they \"hate\" us? One word: Bush. Or two words: Bush's War. During the last four or five years of the Bush administration, I had many conversations with European friends about U.S. foreign policy, and they didn't actually hate us. What they hated was the Bush foreign policy of invading a country for (in their perception) oil. Prior to the Bush administration, I had been stationed in Germany, Japan, and Korea. I didn't get an overall sense that most people overseas hated the U.S., its President, or his policies. I only started to see this anger when it became obvious that we had been led to war in Iraq based upon lies. This isn't to say everyone loved us prior to that. There were always, and always will be, people who don't like something or someone. But as far as broad perceptions go, the consensus seemed to be \"U.S. good, Bush bad.\" Again, these were my perceptions. Your mileage may vary.",

I can't remember the last time a President acted to curb, or at least hold steady, the powers of the Executive. I think this was one of the greatest concerns of the framers of the Constitution. They had just rebelled from a king with autocratic powers, and they wanted to try to prevent such a powerful Executive from developing in their new nation. Unfortunately, too often the Legislative and Judicial branches have acquiesed or even actively participated in the aggrandizement of the Executive.
