Would you suggest a poll? How many of us approve of this? Disappove, have no opinion? If no one comments it means they approve? One of the nice things about our country, is that no one has to prove the obvious. We don't need to run story after story, to convince Americans that this is WRONG. No one needs to run story after story \"Proving\" that Al Qaeda is evil but when an American tortures people it is. Dog bites man is no story at all. Which is why you don't see to much coverage of the million or so dog biting incidents that occur each year. Dave",
