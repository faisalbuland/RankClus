Still no leads, they do have the trucks mirror that was broken off, but no VIN on it or anything. It's like some people have resorted to human deaths no different to hitting an animal...very sad.",

He explained to me a series of characteristics he had recognized over his many years of service. I thanked him, but was unsure if those indicators were transferrable to criminal incidents until I was handling a fatal, pedestrian, crash where the driver fled the scene. The exact image of what my friend explained walked out from a line of trees. I wondered where is he walking from. He fit every pattern the F/F said. The guy walked up sheepishly and tried to resemble a normally-concerned citizen. His facial expressions showed fear and at first he wouldn't look me in the eye. Later he tried to become overly helpful. This behavior made me realize he was somebody who knew more than what he was saying. A walk back through the trees discovered his damaged truck and made me know he was a suspect. Later he admitted all but still brought us to a 9 day trial. He spent the next 4 yrs in prison. I think he would've been caught anyway, but it was the fire fighter who introduced me to recognizing this form of body language. I'm delighted knowing the victim's family got closure and it's made me a better teacher to new cops.",
