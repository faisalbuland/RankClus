The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 28% believe the release of the memos helps America\u2019s image abroad. Thirty-seven percent (37%) of voters now believe the U.S. legal system worries too much about protecting individual rights when national security is at stake. But 21% say the legal system is too concerned about protecting national security. Thirty-three percent (33%) say the balance between the two is about right. Only 28% of U.S. voters think the Obama administration should do any further investigating of how the Bush administration treated terrorism suspects. Fifty-eight percent (58%) are opposed.

Seventy-seven percent (77%) of Republicans and 62% of voters not affiliated with either major party are against more investigating.
