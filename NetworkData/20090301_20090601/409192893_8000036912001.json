Let us not forget LCDR, that the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress for six out of the eight years of Bush tenure. I find it incredibly amusing, that the Dems get all the blame for all of the country's failures, in only controlling the Congress just two of those eight years. And it won't matter if President Obama/administration is successful in fixing the economic woes. The folks who despise him the most made themselves very clear about their distaste for the man back during the November elections. I don't like to use the word hate, however, hatred for this man started a long time ago. That mind set simply won't change regardless how successful he is. Yep, it's really that simple with the mind set of the hard core neocon-whingers. Since \"mind sets\" are literally set in stone by a lot of folks on this site, it makes me wonder, why even bother to argue against one another? No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

LOL...You all can try really hard, but it simply cannot be denied (despite attempts by Dick Cheney) that Barack Obama walked into a disaster not of his making. Sean Hannity can scream his Mark Levine talking points (he has gotten so much more screechy since Alan Combs left) as loud as he likes, but the American people aren't buying it. The President, by saying that he didn't make the mess, but is taking responsibility for the clean up...is simply stating FACTS. I understand that responsibility and facts will take some getting used to after the last eight years. We'll give ya'll some time to adjust.",

Nice try, but that was more of a Hmmm, \"nothing of consequence\"? Perhaps you should look up the Lugar-Obama bill and the Coburn-Obama Transparency Act. You might, while you are looking, note that President Obama, in his first two years as Senator (at a time when the GOP was in control), sponsored 152 bills and resolutions, and cosponsored 427.",
