The case comes as prosecutors nationwide pursue child pornography cases resulting from kids sending nude photos to one another over cell phones and e-mail. Legal experts, though, could not recall another case of a child porn charge resulting from a teen's posting to a social networking site. MySpace would not comment on the New Jersey investigation, but the company has a team that reviews its network for inappropriate images. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children tipped off a state task force, which alerted the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. The office investigated and discovered the Clifton resident had posted the \"very explicit\" photos of herself, sheriff's spokesman Bill Maer said Thursday. \"We consider this case a wake-up call to parents,\" Maer said. The girl posted the photos because \"she wanted her boyfriend to see them,\" he said. Investigators are looking at individuals who \"knowingly\" committed a crime, he said, declining to comment further because the case is still being investigated. The teen, whose name has not been released because of her age, was arrested and charged with possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography. She was released to her mother's custody. If convicted of the distribution charge, she would be forced to register with the state as a sex offender under Megan's Law, said state Attorney General Anne Milgram. She also could face up to 17 years in jail, though such a stiff sentence is unlikely. Some observers - including the New Jersey mother behind the creation of Megan's Law - are criticizing the trend of prosecuting teens who send racy text messages or post illicit photos of themselves. Maureen Kanka - whose daughter, Megan, became the law's namesake after she was raped and killed at age 7 in 1994 by a twice-convicted sex offender - blasted authorities for charging the 14-year-old girl. The teen needs help, not legal trouble, she said.[QUOTE] \"http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_12006785\"",

The case comes as prosecutors nationwide pursue child pornography cases resulting from kids sending nude photos to one another over cell phones and e-mail. Legal experts, though, could not recall another case of a child porn charge resulting from a teen's posting to a social networking site. MySpace would not comment on the New Jersey investigation, but the company has a team that reviews its network for inappropriate images. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children tipped off a state task force, which alerted the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. The office investigated and discovered the Clifton resident had posted the \"very explicit\" photos of herself, sheriff's spokesman Bill Maer said Thursday. \"We consider this case a wake-up call to parents,\" Maer said. The girl posted the photos because \"she wanted her boyfriend to see them,\" he said. Investigators are looking at individuals who \"knowingly\" committed a crime, he said, declining to comment further because the case is still being investigated. The teen, whose name has not been released because of her age, was arrested and charged with possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography. She was released to her mother's custody. If convicted of the distribution charge, she would be forced to register with the state as a sex offender under Megan's Law, said state Attorney General Anne Milgram. She also could face up to 17 years in jail, though such a stiff sentence is unlikely. Some observers - including the New Jersey mother behind the creation of Megan's Law - are criticizing the trend of prosecuting teens who send racy text messages or post illicit photos of themselves. Maureen Kanka - whose daughter, Megan, became the law's namesake after she was raped and killed at age 7 in 1994 by a twice-convicted sex offender - blasted authorities for charging the 14-year-old girl. The teen needs help, not legal trouble, she said.[QUOTE] \"http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_12006785\"",

She committed suicide? Maybe she would have committed suicide with less delay if she had been arrested and publicly charged with distributing kiddie porn? I didn't start this thread to demand that kiddie porn be legalised, but when a 14 year old (14 year old?) posts pictures of herself, it's called being dumb - When she's arrested for distributing child pornography, that called outrageous. Now being dumb is a characteristic of people that age. Someone should have told her parents. But in the eyes of the law, this is no joke. No matter what happens, the \"charges,\" resemble a headline from the Onion. Teen posts nude photos of self, faces charges of distributing Kiddie Porn. Let's keep our eye on the eight ball here. As for those who say that this arrest will serve as a warning to others, they too have to be kidding. Been a long time since they were 14... Dave",

The case comes as prosecutors nationwide pursue child pornography cases resulting from kids sending nude photos to one another over cell phones and e-mail. Legal experts, though, could not recall another case of a child porn charge resulting from a teen's posting to a social networking site. MySpace would not comment on the New Jersey investigation, but the company has a team that reviews its network for inappropriate images. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children tipped off a state task force, which alerted the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. The office investigated and discovered the Clifton resident had posted the \"very explicit\" photos of herself, sheriff's spokesman Bill Maer said Thursday. \"We consider this case a wake-up call to parents,\" Maer said. The girl posted the photos because \"she wanted her boyfriend to see them,\" he said. Investigators are looking at individuals who \"knowingly\" committed a crime, he said, declining to comment further because the case is still being investigated. The teen, whose name has not been released because of her age, was arrested and charged with possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography. She was released to her mother's custody. If convicted of the distribution charge, she would be forced to register with the state as a sex offender under Megan's Law, said state Attorney General Anne Milgram. She also could face up to 17 years in jail, though such a stiff sentence is unlikely. Some observers - including the New Jersey mother behind the creation of Megan's Law - are criticizing the trend of prosecuting teens who send racy text messages or post illicit photos of themselves. Maureen Kanka - whose daughter, Megan, became the law's namesake after she was raped and killed at age 7 in 1994 by a twice-convicted sex offender - blasted authorities for charging the 14-year-old girl. The teen needs help, not legal trouble, she said.[QUOTE] \"http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_12006785\"",

Smile Dave One of those few times that Dave and I agree on something. Some of you folks here seem far detached from reality. After seeing similar stories in Indianapolis area, I asked my middle school aged son about it and he replied it is rather common its only a small percentage that get caught. I will maintain that the adults such as the police and prosecutors are all closet pedophiles and more than likely have copies on their personal computer. Most obsessive folks like these usually are hiding a serious sin of their own. Additionally, since when has simple nudity grown to the point of pornography?

I didn't start this thread to demand that kiddie porn be legalised, but when a 14 year old (14 year old?) posts pictures of herself, it's called being dumb - When she's arrested for distributing child pornography, that called outrageous. Now being dumb is a characteristic of people that age. Someone should have told her parents. But in the eyes of the law, this is no joke. No matter what happens, the \"charges,\" resemble a headline from the Onion. Teen posts nude photos of self, faces charges of distributing Kiddie Porn. Let's keep our eye on the eight ball here. As for those who say that this arrest will serve as a warning to others, they too have to be kidding. Been a long time since they were 14... Smile Dave",

The case comes as prosecutors nationwide pursue child pornography cases resulting from kids sending nude photos to one another over cell phones and e-mail. Legal experts, though, could not recall another case of a child porn charge resulting from a teen's posting to a social networking site. MySpace would not comment on the New Jersey investigation, but the company has a team that reviews its network for inappropriate images. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children tipped off a state task force, which alerted the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. The office investigated and discovered the Clifton resident had posted the \"very explicit\" photos of herself, sheriff's spokesman Bill Maer said Thursday. \"We consider this case a wake-up call to parents,\" Maer said. The girl posted the photos because \"she wanted her boyfriend to see them,\" he said. Investigators are looking at individuals who \"knowingly\" committed a crime, he said, declining to comment further because the case is still being investigated. The teen, whose name has not been released because of her age, was arrested and charged with possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography. She was released to her mother's custody. If convicted of the distribution charge, she would be forced to register with the state as a sex offender under Megan's Law, said state Attorney General Anne Milgram. She also could face up to 17 years in jail, though such a stiff sentence is unlikely. Some observers - including the New Jersey mother behind the creation of Megan's Law - are criticizing the trend of prosecuting teens who send racy text messages or post illicit photos of themselves. Maureen Kanka - whose daughter, Megan, became the law's namesake after she was raped and killed at age 7 in 1994 by a twice-convicted sex offender - blasted authorities for charging the 14-year-old girl. The teen needs help, not legal trouble, she said.[QUOTE] \"http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_12006785\"",

The case comes as prosecutors nationwide pursue child pornography cases resulting from kids sending nude photos to one another over cell phones and e-mail. Legal experts, though, could not recall another case of a child porn charge resulting from a teen's posting to a social networking site. MySpace would not comment on the New Jersey investigation, but the company has a team that reviews its network for inappropriate images. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children tipped off a state task force, which alerted the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. The office investigated and discovered the Clifton resident had posted the \"very explicit\" photos of herself, sheriff's spokesman Bill Maer said Thursday. \"We consider this case a wake-up call to parents,\" Maer said. The girl posted the photos because \"she wanted her boyfriend to see them,\" he said. Investigators are looking at individuals who \"knowingly\" committed a crime, he said, declining to comment further because the case is still being investigated. The teen, whose name has not been released because of her age, was arrested and charged with possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography. She was released to her mother's custody. If convicted of the distribution charge, she would be forced to register with the state as a sex offender under Megan's Law, said state Attorney General Anne Milgram. She also could face up to 17 years in jail, though such a stiff sentence is unlikely. Some observers - including the New Jersey mother behind the creation of Megan's Law - are criticizing the trend of prosecuting teens who send racy text messages or post illicit photos of themselves. Maureen Kanka - whose daughter, Megan, became the law's namesake after she was raped and killed at age 7 in 1994 by a twice-convicted sex offender - blasted authorities for charging the 14-year-old girl. The teen needs help, not legal trouble, she said.[QUOTE] \"http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_12006785\"",

Chet Culver can't block a potentially dangerous sex offender from being released from prison on Saturday, even though the inmate has warned he will reoffend, a Culver aide said today. Michael Lewis McGill, 50, is scheduled to be transported on Saturday from the Oakdale state prison near Iowa City to the Fort Des Moines Correctional Facility on Des Moines\u2019 south side. He will remain there indefinitely under correctional supervision. Some community members have expressed fears he could still harm people. \u201cGov. Culver\u2019s No. 1 priority as governor is ensuring public safety. Gov. Culver, however, does not have the authority under Iowa Code to keep individuals in prison once their term has expired,\u201d said Culver spokesman Troy Price. Read the whole article Sex offenders are out there Let's fix the problem Sue ( 16yrs old )shouldn't be branded for shooting a picture of her self and emailing it to her 16yr old boy friend But you've got some BA5TARD out there preying on 4 yr olds. I want the public to know where that piece of 5HIT is. Let's not throw everything out and wait for the perfect law to just appear out of nothing. Example I remember Ronald Reagan as President talking about the problems of Social Security How we weren't going to just jump in because we had time to fix this. So we would take the time to fix this right the first time. TICK TOCK TICK TOCK Still waiting on the FIX to SS The Magic fix has yet to appear If we dump this LAW How many Sexual Assaults will occur??????????? How many children RAPED or KILLED by Predators is an acceptable number for you?????????? 5,000 10,000 a year you pick a number If you are lucky it won't happen to anyone you know. I on the other hand believe there is no Magic fix. We need to work to improve the LAWS we have Kinda like the Constitution If it was a fixed document Unable to change, unable to be improved We might not be here now By the way Your numbers, could you give me the link you used ( inactive of course ) Because your nearly 170,000 of them were convicted while they were under the age of 21 Legal age is 18 not 21 So is it really - 15% sex offenders are minors And the comment of nearly half of that are less than 16 yr old We've got murderers out there at 16 and under So maybe age is not the defining point you want or should be pushing This message has been edited.

Read the whole article Sex offenders are out there Let's fix the problem Sue ( 16yrs old )shouldn't be branded for shooting a picture of her self and emailing it to her 16yr old boy friend But you've got some BA5TARD out there preying on 4 yr olds. I want the public to know where that piece of 5HIT is. Let's not throw everything out and wait for the perfect law to just appear out of nothing. Example I remember Ronald Reagan as President talking about the problems of Social Security How we weren't going to just jump in because we had time to fix this. So we would take the time to fix this right the first time. TICK TOCK TICK TOCK Still waiting on the FIX to SS The Magic fix has yet to appear If we dump this LAW How many Sexual Assaults will occur??????????? How many children RAPED or KILLED by Predators is an acceptable number for you?????????? 5,000 10,000 a year you pick a number If you are lucky it won't happen to anyone you know. I on the other hand believe there is no Magic fix. We need to work to improve the LAWS we have Kinda like the Constitution If it was a fixed document Unable to change, unable to be improved We might not be here now By the way Your numbers, could you give me the link you used ( inactive of course ) Because your nearly 170,000 of them were convicted while they were under the age of 21 Legal age is 18 not 21 So is it really - 15% sex offenders are minors And the comment of nearly half of that are less than 16 yr old We've got murderers out there at 16 and under So maybe age is not the defining point you want or should be pushing This message has been edited.
