An immigration judge in Arlington, Va., issued the stay of a deportation expected during the weekend, said his son, John Demjanjuk Jr. Immigration Judge Wayne Iskra on Friday ordered that Demjanjuk's deportation be put on hold until the court can rule on his request to reopen the U.S. case that ordered his removal. Authorities in Germany said Demjanjuk had been expected there by Monday. Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills, kept out of sight Friday, as he has for years. He has argued that his deportation would amount to torture, given his frail health. A German arrest warrant issued in March accuses the Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk of 29,000 counts of acting as an accessory to murder at the Sobibor camp in occupied Poland during World War II. In Germany, Demjanjuk would have a chance to respond to the allegations before a judge. He denies involvement in any deaths. In a three-page signed statement, Demjanjuk asked earlier in the week for asylum in the U.S. and said deporting him \"will expose me to severe physical and mental pain that clearly amount to torture under any reasonable definition of the term.\" (...) Demjanjuk's U.S. citizenship was restored in 1998 and revoked again in 2002. The U.S. Department of Justice renewed its case, saying he had indeed been a Nazi guard and could be deported for falsifying information on his U.S. immigration paperwork.",
