How are they suppose to know right from wrong when you've removed your teacher(GOD) from every aspect of your life. Just another example of the slippery slop to hell. Anyone remember what our founding father said \" ONE NATION UNDER GOD\" Really? Which one said that, hmmm? Or are you just another historical illiterate who believes that because of the phrase which was added to the Pledge of Allegience in 1956 also believes that it has been there since the founding of the Republic? If thats what you base it on, you need to know that the original Pledge was first penned in 1892 by Francis Bellamy (a Christian Socialist and Baptist Minister) for a youth magazine and it went like this: quote: I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands: one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all. ...with the motive of increasing both circulation of the magazines and flag sales. This some 118 years after the writing of the Declaration of Independence and 104 years after the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. As I stated above, the phrase in question was not added until the McCarthy/Red Scare era in 1956, a full 180 years after the Declaration, and that only after three interim changes to it during the lifetime of it's author ALL OF WHICH he objected to! The last came after his 1933 death and his Granddaughter related in an interview that she felt that Francis must certainly be \"spinning in his grave\" over the adding of that phrase. Further, if you review the founding documents, you'll not find God nor Christ, much less Christianity mentioned in either unless you loosely interpret the phrase \"Year of our Lord\" which was stock legalese of the day, or the phrase \"....to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them....\" which does not at all single out any one religion, but rather is simply an open-ended Deist phrase which appears to acknowledge some \"higher power.\" Go crack a real history book or, better still, read the words actually written by our founders, and not just those written (complete with mis-quotes) by fundie tub-thumpers! {Edited for clarity of detail.} This message has been edited.

Are you just a God hater who cant pull out some currency from 1934 or 1919 and see it also has \"In God We Trust\" on it? I just did, and its right there in front of my eyes. I guess your history book needs to come from somewhere else than Al Frankken-stien's library.",
        "reply": " It first appeared on some locally-minted coins after the Revolution, but only on a very limited basis and intermittently on some other coins following the Civil War (1864); it also appeared sporadically in the first half of the 20th century on some denominations of coinage, but did not become a de riguer \"National Motto\" legislated by Congress until 1956! This Act of Congress was pushed by the Knights of Columbus and Protestant Groups (strange bed-fellows indeed). This was also true of the events following the limited usage following the Civil war; a groundswell movement of \"devout\" Christians in a letter writing campaign. That movement got started as early as 1861 via a written appeal by Reverend M. R. Watkinson. The upshot is that it did not become a law of the land until 1956; prior to that time, dating all the way back to the founding, the only national motto we had was \"E Pluribus Unum\" (Out of many, one). No \"Founding Father\" made such a statement as the poster tries to claim, and that is the point I was addressing! As to folding money? quote: In God We Trust was first used on paper money in 1957 when it appeared on the one-dollar Silver Certificate. The first paper currency bearing the motto entered circulation on October 1, 1957. And I've never listened to, nor read anything by Al Franken - unless you count the time he handed Bill O'really his azz in that debate! That was pretty entertaining! I thought Billy boy was gonna stroke out on the spot! I just happened to catch a replay of that on the Daily Show; funny stuff! And as to the \"God Hater\" remark, how could I possibly hate something which doesn't exist? Don't be so childish! It is not our belief or disbelief that can make or unmake the fact. ~ Thomas Paine",
