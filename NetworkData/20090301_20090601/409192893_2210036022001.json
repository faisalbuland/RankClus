In its first year, the new revolutionary government expropriated private property with little or no compensation, nationalised public utilities, tightened controls on the private sector and closed down the gambling industry. The government also evicted many US citizens from the island. Some of these measures were undertaken by Fidel Castro's government in the name of the program outlined in the Manifesto of the Sierra Maestra, while in the Sierra Maestra. The regime nationalized of private property totaling about $25 billion U.S. dollars, out of which American property made up only over US $1.0 billion. By the end of 1960, all opposition newspaper had been closed down and all radio and television stations were in state control. Moderates, teachers and professors were purged. In any given year, there were about 20,000 dissents held and tortured under inhuman prison conditions. Groups such as homosexuals were locked up in internment camps in the 1960s, where they were subject to medical-political \"re-education\".[50] One estimate is that 15,000-17,000 people were executed. The Communist Party strengthened its one-party rule, with Castro as the supreme leader. Fidel's brother Raul Castro became the army chief. Loyalty to Castro became the primary criteria for all appointments. In September 1960, the regime created a system known as Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), which provided neighborhood spying. In the 1961 New Year's Day parade, the Communist administration exhibited Soviet tanks and other weapons. Eventually the tiny island nation built up the second largest armed forces in Latin America, second only to Brazil. Cuba became a privileged client-state of the Soviet Union. By 1961, hundreds of thousands had fled for the United States. In 1961, John F. Kennedy became President of the United States. He supported CIA-assisted exile efforts to conduct Bay of Pigs invasion and restore multiparty democracy in Cuba, with professor and the first post-revolution Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mir\u00f3 Cardona serving as provisional head of state. However, Kennedy denied American troops and other direct involvement, and the plan failed. This was followed the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The Kennedy administration demanded the immediate withdrawal of missiles placed in Cuba by the USSR, which was a response to U.S. nuclear missiles placed in Turkey and the Middle East. The Soviets backed down, and made a agreement with Kennedy in which all missiles were to be withdrawn from Cuba and the U.S. would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and elsewhere in the Middle East within a few months. Kennedy also agreed not to invade Cuba in the future. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban exiles captured at the Bay of Pigs were \"ransomed\" for a shipment of supplies from the U.S. By 1963 Castro moved Cuba towards a full-fledged Communist system modeled on the Soviet Union. The U.S. imposed a complete diplomatic and commercial embargo on Cuba, and began Operation Mongoose. In 1965 Castro merged his revolutionary organizations with the Communist Party, of which he became First Secretary, with Blas Roca as Second Secretary. Roca was succeeded by Ra\u00fal Castro, who, as Defense Minister and Fidel's closest confidant, became and has remained the second most powerful figure in the government. Ra\u00fal Castro's position was strengthened by the departure of Che Guevara to launch unsuccessful attempts at insurrectionary movements in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and then Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967. During the 1970s, Castro dispatched tens of thousands troops to assist the MPLA in Angola and leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia. By 1970s the standard of living was \"extremely spartan\" and discontent was rife. Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech. Castro started economic reforms by mid-1970s. The regime dispatched troops to fight Soviet-supported wars in Africa. Cuba had been expelled from the Organization of American States in 1962 and supported the embargo, but in 1975 the OAS lifted all sanctions against Cuba and both Mexico and Canada broke ranks with the U.S. by developing closer relations with Cuba.[citation needed] From 1959 through 1993, some 1.2 million Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States[59], often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. On Sunday, April 6, 1980 ten thousand Cubans stormed the Peruvian embassy in Havana seeking political asylum. On Monday, April 7 the Cuban government granted permission for the emigration of Cubans seeking refuge in the Peruvian embassy. On April 16 500 Cuban citizens left the Peruvian Embassy for Costa Rica. On April 21 many of those Cubans started arriving in Miami via private boats and were halted by the US State Department on April 23. The boat lift continued, however, since Castro allowed anyone who desired to leave the country to do so through the port of Mariel and this emigration became known as the Mariel boatlift. In all, over 125,000 Cubans emigrated to the United States before the flow of vessels ended on June 15. Why wouldn't us Liberal Democrats love Castro, we are so much alike!",

It was like Cuba was someones special little \"enemy\"...sounds like a Neo-Con pet project... Ya it was those Neo-cons that rejected Castro's Cuba. The Cuban Revolution and the Cold War Fidel Castro became prime minister of Cuba in February 1959. In its first year, the new revolutionary government expropriated private property with little or no compensation, nationalised public utilities, tightened controls on the private sector and closed down the gambling industry. The government also evicted many US citizens from the island. Some of these measures were undertaken by Fidel Castro's government in the name of the program outlined in the Manifesto of the Sierra Maestra, while in the Sierra Maestra. The regime nationalized of private property totaling about $25 billion U.S. dollars, out of which American property made up only over US $1.0 billion. By the end of 1960, all opposition newspaper had been closed down and all radio and television stations were in state control. Moderates, teachers and professors were purged. In any given year, there were about 20,000 dissents held and tortured under inhuman prison conditions. Groups such as homosexuals were locked up in internment camps in the 1960s, where they were subject to medical-political \"re-education\".[50] One estimate is that 15,000-17,000 people were executed. The Communist Party strengthened its one-party rule, with Castro as the supreme leader. Fidel's brother Raul Castro became the army chief. Loyalty to Castro became the primary criteria for all appointments. In September 1960, the regime created a system known as Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), which provided neighborhood spying. In the 1961 New Year's Day parade, the Communist administration exhibited Soviet tanks and other weapons. Eventually the tiny island nation built up the second largest armed forces in Latin America, second only to Brazil. Cuba became a privileged client-state of the Soviet Union. By 1961, hundreds of thousands had fled for the United States. In 1961, John F. Kennedy became President of the United States. He supported CIA-assisted exile efforts to conduct Bay of Pigs invasion and restore multiparty democracy in Cuba, with professor and the first post-revolution Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mir\u00f3 Cardona serving as provisional head of state. However, Kennedy denied American troops and other direct involvement, and the plan failed. This was followed the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The Kennedy administration demanded the immediate withdrawal of missiles placed in Cuba by the USSR, which was a response to U.S. nuclear missiles placed in Turkey and the Middle East. The Soviets backed down, and made a agreement with Kennedy in which all missiles were to be withdrawn from Cuba and the U.S. would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and elsewhere in the Middle East within a few months. Kennedy also agreed not to invade Cuba in the future. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban exiles captured at the Bay of Pigs were \"ransomed\" for a shipment of supplies from the U.S. By 1963 Castro moved Cuba towards a full-fledged Communist system modeled on the Soviet Union. The U.S. imposed a complete diplomatic and commercial embargo on Cuba, and began Operation Mongoose. In 1965 Castro merged his revolutionary organizations with the Communist Party, of which he became First Secretary, with Blas Roca as Second Secretary. Roca was succeeded by Ra\u00fal Castro, who, as Defense Minister and Fidel's closest confidant, became and has remained the second most powerful figure in the government. Ra\u00fal Castro's position was strengthened by the departure of Che Guevara to launch unsuccessful attempts at insurrectionary movements in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and then Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967. During the 1970s, Castro dispatched tens of thousands troops to assist the MPLA in Angola and leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia. By 1970s the standard of living was \"extremely spartan\" and discontent was rife. Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech. Castro started economic reforms by mid-1970s. The regime dispatched troops to fight Soviet-supported wars in Africa. Cuba had been expelled from the Organization of American States in 1962 and supported the embargo, but in 1975 the OAS lifted all sanctions against Cuba and both Mexico and Canada broke ranks with the U.S. by developing closer relations with Cuba.[citation needed] From 1959 through 1993, some 1.2 million Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States[59], often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. On Sunday, April 6, 1980 ten thousand Cubans stormed the Peruvian embassy in Havana seeking political asylum. On Monday, April 7 the Cuban government granted permission for the emigration of Cubans seeking refuge in the Peruvian embassy. On April 16 500 Cuban citizens left the Peruvian Embassy for Costa Rica. On April 21 many of those Cubans started arriving in Miami via private boats and were halted by the US State Department on April 23. The boat lift continued, however, since Castro allowed anyone who desired to leave the country to do so through the port of Mariel and this emigration became known as the Mariel boatlift. In all, over 125,000 Cubans emigrated to the United States before the flow of vessels ended on June 15. Why wouldn't us Liberal Democrats love Castro, we are so much alike!",
