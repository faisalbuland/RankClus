The Iraqi prisoners/detainees survived the underwear-on-the-head treatment... without any marks or bruises. Our military may not survive the stupid inquiries of the American-hating news media. BTW --- Just a reminder to you and the other Bush/Cheney haters on this site: Since the Sept. 11th 2001 attacks on us, the U.S.A. has not been attacked again on our shores by the jihadist terrorists.

The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you. You should read a book called, \"Four Came Home\", the story of the four surviving members of the two crews from the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, that fell into Imperial Japanese hands, THEN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS, AS THE BOOK ADDRESSES SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS TODAY, ONLY WE COMMITTED THE ACTS TODAY AND NOT THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE...

The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you. You should read a book called, \"Four Came Home\", the story of the four surviving members of the two crews from the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, that fell into Imperial Japanese hands, THEN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS, AS THE BOOK ADDRESSES SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS TODAY, ONLY WE COMMITTED THE ACTS TODAY AND NOT THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE... Please go to your local library and check out a copy of the book, the author is Lt.Col. Carroll V. Glines... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 You overlook the fact that as soon as it was no longer politically expedient to prosecute the Japanese the trials stopped. The same thing will happen with the present situation. As soon as Obama needs the attention of the sheeple somewhere else all the hooplah will end. Uh, you do have a very strange view of history, you'd better go and check your facts... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Sorry to pop you altruistic bubble, but the facts are what they are. We only prosecuted Japanese officials when it was politically expedient to do so. Were it otherwise the Emperor would have been dangling from a rope along with those who followed his orders. The only reason that the Emperor was not prosecuted, was because MacArthur didn't want the Japanese citizens fighting to the last person with American troops in the street... He gradually brought the Emperor down to human level and demonstrated to the Japanese people that the Emperor was not a god that had descended from heaven, to sit upon the crysanthimum[sp?] throne... If you don't think that the prosecution went fully up the chain of command and into the civil government, just ask Tojo... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you.

Uh, you do have a very strange view of history, you'd better go and check your facts... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Sorry to pop you altruistic bubble, but the facts are what they are. We only prosecuted Japanese officials when it was politically expedient to do so. Were it otherwise the Emperor would have been dangling from a rope along with those who followed his orders. It is not altruism, to prosecute those that break the law and it would seem that the former President and his VP and his advisers, did just that... The only way that the United States can maintain the moral high ground and win this war, is to not reduce ourselves to the level of the animals like Ossama bin Laden, if we do, then they have won...

There is no such thing as \"enhanced\" questioning techniques, torture is torture and if Bush, Chaney, Rice and any lawyers advised them so and the acts were carried out, then they and those that did it are guilty of torture... If the United States is to have any credibility in this world, then it must be investigated and if it is proven that it was authorized, then those persons, in anyway connected, must be held over to a public trial... This was all sorted out and codified into law at the end of WW-II, there is no excuse for torture, there is no excuse that, \"the ends justified the means\" and \"I was just following orders\", are not valid excuses... The asinine excuse of \"well there have been no other attacks since 09-11-01\", is not an excuse to violate, U.S. law, U.S. military law and international treaty, THERE IS NO EXCUSE, LEGAL OR OTHERWISE FOR TORTURE, PERIOD!... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I agree with all of the above. As should any member of the US Armed Forces. Yes, by all means gather up the dogs and ponies and let the show begin. Call it what you will but, it needs to be investigated and let the cards fall where they may... Otherwise, the United States will have no credibility what so ever, when U.S. prisoners are tortured and or murdered, NONE...

There is no such thing as \"enhanced\" questioning techniques, torture is torture and if Bush, Chaney, Rice and any lawyers advised them so and the acts were carried out, then they and those that did it are guilty of torture... If the United States is to have any credibility in this world, then it must be investigated and if it is proven that it was authorized, then those persons, in anyway connected, must be held over to a public trial...

Did the islamic radicals get \"nicer\" in the last several years..? No! It is because for 8 years the men at the White House gave orders to thwart/stop/impede the various Terrorists ! The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you. You should read a book called, \"Four Came Home\", the story of the four surviving members of the two crews from the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, that fell into Imperial Japanese hands, THEN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS, AS THE BOOK ADDRESSES SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS TODAY, ONLY WE COMMITTED THE ACTS TODAY AND NOT THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE... Please go to your local library and check out a copy of the book, the author is Lt.Col. Carroll V. Glines... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 You overlook the fact that as soon as it was no longer politically expedient to prosecute the Japanese the trials stopped. The same thing will happen with the present situation. As soon as Obama needs the attention of the sheeple somewhere else all the hooplah will end. Uh, you do have a very strange view of history, you'd better go and check your facts... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Sorry to pop you altruistic bubble, but the facts are what they are. We only prosecuted Japanese officials when it was politically expedient to do so. Were it otherwise the Emperor would have been dangling from a rope along with those who followed his orders.",
        "reply": " It is not altruism, to prosecute those that break the law and it would seem that the former President and his VP and his advisers, did just that... The only way that the United States can maintain the moral high ground and win this war, is to not reduce ourselves to the level of the animals like Ossama bin Laden, if we do, then they have won... We are better than they are... Please read the book, \"Four Came Home\" by Carroll V. Glines, it will make it clear to you... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

The asinine excuse of \"well there have been no other attacks since 09-11-01\", is not an excuse to violate, U.S. law, U.S. military law and international treaty, THERE IS NO EXCUSE, LEGAL OR OTHERWISE FOR TORTURE, PERIOD!... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I agree with all of the above. As should any member of the US Armed Forces. Yes, by all means gather up the dogs and ponies and let the show begin.",

Otherwise, the United States will have no credibility what so ever, when U.S. prisoners are tortured and or murdered, NONE...

The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you.

We only prosecuted Japanese officials when it was politically expedient to do so. Were it otherwise the Emperor would have been dangling from a rope along with those who followed his orders. The only reason that the Emperor was not prosecuted, was because MacArthur didn't want the Japanese citizens fighting to the last person with American troops in the street... He gradually brought the Emperor down to human level and demonstrated to the Japanese people that the Emperor was not a god that had descended from heaven, to sit upon the crysanthimum[sp?] throne...

Also read the history of Admiral James Stockdale and read what was done to him (and the others) in captivity by the communists. The Iraqi prisoners/detainees survived the underwear-on-the-head treatment... without any marks or bruises. Our military may not survive the stupid inquiries of the American-hating news media. BTW --- Just a reminder to you and the other Bush/Cheney haters on this site: Since the Sept. 11th 2001 attacks on us, the U.S.A. has not been attacked again on our shores by the jihadist terrorists. Did the islamic radicals get \"nicer\" in the last several years..? No! It is because for 8 years the men at the White House gave orders to thwart/stop/impede the various Terrorists ! The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you. You should read a book called, \"Four Came Home\", the story of the four surviving members of the two crews from the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, that fell into Imperial Japanese hands, THEN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS, AS THE BOOK ADDRESSES SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS TODAY, ONLY WE COMMITTED THE ACTS TODAY AND NOT THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE... Please go to your local library and check out a copy of the book, the author is Lt.Col. Carroll V. Glines... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

You should read a book called, \"Four Came Home\", the story of the four surviving members of the two crews from the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, that fell into Imperial Japanese hands, THEN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS, AS THE BOOK ADDRESSES SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS TODAY, ONLY WE COMMITTED THE ACTS TODAY AND NOT THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE... Please go to your local library and check out a copy of the book, the author is Lt.Col. Carroll V. Glines... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 You overlook the fact that as soon as it was no longer politically expedient to prosecute the Japanese the trials stopped. The same thing will happen with the present situation. As soon as Obama needs the attention of the sheeple somewhere else all the hooplah will end. Uh, you do have a very strange view of history, you'd better go and check your facts... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Sorry to pop you altruistic bubble, but the facts are what they are. We only prosecuted Japanese officials when it was politically expedient to do so. Were it otherwise the Emperor would have been dangling from a rope along with those who followed his orders. It is not altruism, to prosecute those that break the law and it would seem that the former President and his VP and his advisers, did just that... The only way that the United States can maintain the moral high ground and win this war, is to not reduce ourselves to the level of the animals like Ossama bin Laden, if we do, then they have won... We are better than they are... Please read the book, \"Four Came Home\" by Carroll V. Glines, it will make it clear to you... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

There is no such thing as \"enhanced\" questioning techniques, torture is torture and if Bush, Chaney, Rice and any lawyers advised them so and the acts were carried out, then they and those that did it are guilty of torture...

This was all sorted out and codified into law at the end of WW-II, there is no excuse for torture, there is no excuse that, \"the ends justified the means\" and \"I was just following orders\", are not valid excuses... The asinine excuse of \"well there have been no other attacks since 09-11-01\", is not an excuse to violate, U.S. law, U.S. military law and international treaty, THERE IS NO EXCUSE, LEGAL OR OTHERWISE FOR TORTURE, PERIOD!... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 I agree with all of the above. As should any member of the US Armed Forces. Yes, by all means gather up the dogs and ponies and let the show begin. Call it what you will but, it needs to be investigated and let the cards fall where they may... Otherwise, the United States will have no credibility what so ever, when U.S. prisoners are tortured and or murdered, NONE... We remain on the moral high ground or we simple STFU, when it happens to our troops... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you.

We only prosecuted Japanese officials when it was politically expedient to do so. Were it otherwise the Emperor would have been dangling from a rope along with those who followed his orders. The only reason that the Emperor was not prosecuted, was because MacArthur didn't want the Japanese citizens fighting to the last person with American troops in the street... He gradually brought the Emperor down to human level and demonstrated to the Japanese people that the Emperor was not a god that had descended from heaven, to sit upon the crysanthimum[sp?] throne...

If you or the person who you agreed with above wants to find out about real \"Torture\", then get a copy of the movie \"Hanoi Hilton\" and watch what the \"Pees woving peepils ov Vee it naam\" did to our POWs. Also read the history of Admiral James Stockdale and read what was done to him (and the others) in captivity by the communists. The Iraqi prisoners/detainees survived the underwear-on-the-head treatment... without any marks or bruises. Our military may not survive the stupid inquiries of the American-hating news media. BTW --- Just a reminder to you and the other Bush/Cheney haters on this site: Since the Sept. 11th 2001 attacks on us, the U.S.A. has not been attacked again on our shores by the jihadist terrorists. Did the islamic radicals get \"nicer\" in the last several years..? No! It is because for 8 years the men at the White House gave orders to thwart/stop/impede the various Terrorists ! The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you. You should read a book called, \"Four Came Home\", the story of the four surviving members of the two crews from the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, that fell into Imperial Japanese hands, THEN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS, AS THE BOOK ADDRESSES SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS TODAY, ONLY WE COMMITTED THE ACTS TODAY AND NOT THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE... Please go to your local library and check out a copy of the book, the author is Lt.Col. Carroll V. Glines... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 You overlook the fact that as soon as it was no longer politically expedient to prosecute the Japanese the trials stopped. The same thing will happen with the present situation. As soon as Obama needs the attention of the sheeple somewhere else all the hooplah will end. Uh, you do have a very strange view of history, you'd better go and check your facts... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Sorry to pop you altruistic bubble, but the facts are what they are. We only prosecuted Japanese officials when it was politically expedient to do so. Were it otherwise the Emperor would have been dangling from a rope along with those who followed his orders. The only reason that the Emperor was not prosecuted, was because MacArthur didn't want the Japanese citizens fighting to the last person with American troops in the street... He gradually brought the Emperor down to human level and demonstrated to the Japanese people that the Emperor was not a god that had descended from heaven, to sit upon the crysanthimum[sp?] throne... If you don't think that the prosecution went fully up the chain of command and into the civil government, just ask Tojo... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

        "reply": " The only reason that the Emperor was not prosecuted, was because MacArthur didn't want the Japanese citizens fighting to the last person with American troops in the street... He gradually brought the Emperor down to human level and demonstrated to the Japanese people that the Emperor was not a god that had descended from heaven, to sit upon the crysanthimum[sp?] throne... If you don't think that the prosecution went fully up the chain of command and into the civil government, just ask Tojo... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

Nope Cider--- What is stupefying is that people call what happened at Abu Graib prison \"Torture\". From the photos which were published (huge mistake to have taken the photos, btw) the Army Reserve MPs were doing to the detainees/prisoners the same thing that hundreds of Frat Houses and Sorority houses do each year during \"Pledge Week\"... at American Colleges. If you or the person who you agreed with above wants to find out about real \"Torture\", then get a copy of the movie \"Hanoi Hilton\" and watch what the \"Pees woving peepils ov Vee it naam\" did to our POWs. Also read the history of Admiral James Stockdale and read what was done to him (and the others) in captivity by the communists. The Iraqi prisoners/detainees survived the underwear-on-the-head treatment... without any marks or bruises. Our military may not survive the stupid inquiries of the American-hating news media. BTW --- Just a reminder to you and the other Bush/Cheney haters on this site: Since the Sept. 11th 2001 attacks on us, the U.S.A. has not been attacked again on our shores by the jihadist terrorists. Did the islamic radicals get \"nicer\" in the last several years..? No! It is because for 8 years the men at the White House gave orders to thwart/stop/impede the various Terrorists ! The hard road may not be the fun and fluffy and fuzzy-wuzzy way of the peaceniks and appeasers in our country (and many of our NATO partners), but it is the one thing that the terrorists ( just as a Grizzly, or Mountain Lion, or Cape Buffalo lives) understands... you must kill them before they kill you. You should read a book called, \"Four Came Home\", the story of the four surviving members of the two crews from the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, that fell into Imperial Japanese hands, THEN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS, AS THE BOOK ADDRESSES SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS TODAY, ONLY WE COMMITTED THE ACTS TODAY AND NOT THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE...

The only way that the United States can maintain the moral high ground and win this war, is to not reduce ourselves to the level of the animals like Ossama bin Laden, if we do, then they have won...
