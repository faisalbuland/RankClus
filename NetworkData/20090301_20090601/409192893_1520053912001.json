        "content": "Dear Steve: Thanks for writing me with your concerns about your daughter\u2019s recent visit home from college. I don\u2019t have a daughter but I can understand the concern you have after seeing such dramatic changes in her after just six months at a public university. After all, you didn\u2019t save money for eighteen long years in order to pay someone to teach her to despise the values you taught for, well, eighteen long years. First of all, I want you to understand that many of the crazy ideas you hear your daughter espousing are commonplace on college campuses. Nonetheless, it must have been shocking for you to hear that she supported Barack Obama in the last election principally because of his ideas about \u201cthe redistribution of wealth.\u201d I know you were also disappointed to hear of her sudden opposition to the War on Terror and her sudden embrace of the United Nations. Most of all, I know you are disappointed that she has stopped going to church altogether. Now that your daughter is not going to church it will be easier to get her to accept other policies based on economic and cultural Marxism. Socialist professors like the fact that average church attendance drops dramatically after just one year of college. God and socialism are simply incompatible. One cannot worship both Jesus Christ and Karl Marx. But there is good news, Steve. I think I can implement a program that will cure your daughter\u2019s Socialist Teaching Disorder (STD) in just a few short days. In case you were wondering, I define STD as the sudden infatuation with socialism brought on by exposure to pro-socialist ideas without a corresponding exposure to anti-socialist ideas. Although not recognized by the APA, this emotional disorder is running rampant at American universities. The solution to your daughter\u2019s STD is to be found in your decision to award her a sum of $4000 if she returns from her freshman year with a 3.5 GPA or above. Previously, you explained to me that you decided to do this for two reasons: 1) Your daughter had earned a $4000 scholarship, which meant you had the extra money, and 2) Your only son had gone to college five years ago and flunked out after one year. Now that your daughter has maintained a 3.6 GPA (so far) you are happy. But you are unhappy that you are about to reward her newfound love of socialism when you had only intended to reward her studiousness. I have a solution that involves three steps. If you follow these steps (in order) we\u2019ll have this little problem cured in no time: 1. When your daughter returns from college in early May (presumably with a GPA over 3.5) I want you to tell her that you lied. Put simply, when she asks about her $4000 just tell her that you never really had any intention of delivering on your promises. This revelation will, no doubt, cause significant consternation and outrage. But when she protests, simply point out that her choice for president, Barack Obama, also lied to her. Note that his lies about earmarks and line-by-line analysis of the budget will probably end up costing her more than $4000. She might say, \u201cBut you\u2019re my father.\u201d If she does, respond by saying \u201cBut I\u2019m not your president.\u201d If things get too uncomfortable, just tell her the $4000 promise was technically \u201clast year\u2019s business.\u201d 2. When your daughter has cooled down somewhat from the realization that her father is a confessed liar I want you to strike again. Since your son, now 23, still lives at home it will be possible for you to implement step two in the presence of both children. This step will involve simply taking out your wallet and writing a $2000 check to your son. This action will, no doubt, cause even more consternation and outrage for your daughter. She may well point out that her brother is unemployed. She may also point out that he has been in rehab twice and that he once punched you in the face while under the influence of drugs. But, when she protests, simply say that it was Barack Obama who taught you to reward failure. She may well say \u201cBut that\u2019s half of the money I was supposed to get.\u201d If so, point out that it is Barack Obama who would like to take other people\u2019s money \u2013 at least half, if not more \u2013 and use much of it to reward bad behavior. By this time, she will probably hate socialism and the lesson will have saved you a lot of money. But, just in case the point is not yet made, there is a third step to my plan. And this is where I get actively involved. 3. I\u2019m going to take your daughter and the remaining $2000 - in the form of one hundred $20 bills \u2013 to the \u201chood.\u201d Specifically, I am going to take her to places where crack cocaine is sold here in Wilmington in the middle of the afternoon. This will include grocery stores and actual crack houses. Don\u2019t worry about your daughter\u2019s safety as I will be armed with a .357 magnum loaded with 145-grain silver tipped hollow point bullets. When I approach a crack head I will first ask whether he paid income taxes last year. If he says \u201cno\u201d I will hand him $20. If your daughter asks me why I give money to people who don\u2019t pay taxes I\u2019ll remind her that this is what President Obama does. Then I\u2019ll ask her if she still believes in \u201cspreading the wealth\u201d without regard to individual merit. By the end of the afternoon, I can guarantee your daughter will be cured of her STD. Sorry if I sound overly optimistic, Steve. I got my optimism from the same place I got my love of capitalism. I learned it from Ronald Reagan, not Barack Obama.",

If your daughter asks me why I give money to people who don\u2019t pay taxes I\u2019ll remind her that this is what President Obama does. Then I\u2019ll ask her if she still believes in \u201cspreading the wealth\u201d without regard to individual merit. By the end of the afternoon, I can guarantee your daughter will be cured of her STD. Sorry if I sound overly optimistic, Steve. I got my optimism from the same place I got my love of capitalism. I learned it from Ronald Reagan, not Barack Obama.",

All of Aesops fables were made up too, unless you think there are reasoning foxes, frogs, etc etc. Or that Jesus's parables refered to actual servants, lost sons, and famlies that lived down the block. THEY ARE EXERCISES IN REASONING. There are NO \"LINKS\" to them and there need not be! Don't agree, LET'S HEAR YOUR REASONING! Thanks mcgreer, for helping prove my point. And, Ray, these are ILLUSTRATIVE PARABLES that have been used for THOUSANDS of years that we know of, right back to the days of Ur. YOUR point, Ray, should be your REASONABLE and well thought out counter argument. Unfortunately, there are none it this world, as even the \"successful\" socialist examples are failing and the real world has examples to the contrary, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot , Hitler (National scocialism), Uncle Ho, etc etc. These peoples ability to create a living hell is thoroughly documented. And there is even a link to the totaling of the murders by government that a few of you socialuist apologists would do well to read,m several times. Start here: \"\"http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/ and this is a must read: \"\"http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CHINA.CHAP1.HTM \"\"http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP12.HTM Oh, and chapters 1 thru 23 as noted on the rt side of these pages. The only was socialism can be \"successful\" in a scociety such as ours is at gunpoint, becayuse the MAJORITY do not agree with the socialist life. Unfortunately, the socialist model has proved an exceptionally powerful magnent to those who are the Stalinist types. You see, in this free CAPITALIST scociety you are FEREE to be Amish, or any type of Socialists you want, there are millions of square miles where you can build your socialist utopia, JUST PLEASE LEAVE US OUT. But that's impossible for the statists among you, isn't it?",
