The results is an Air Battle Area about 300 miles by 500 miles in size. During such training exercises, I have controlled Air Refuelings and fighter intercepts as a Ground Intercept Controller. It was always very challenging, entertaining, rewarding and fun. The guy says it's not a competition... That is TOTAL BS. It is 110% competition: F-16s against F-15s against F-18s against NATO A/C sometimes. AWACS against Ground Controllers. Every \"kill\" is a loss, especially if it's YOUR pilot that got killed. He hates it and you hate it. You'd BETTER be able to show that you gave him proper info and vectors to keep him alive, and he failed to heed, or YOU got him killed!! I NEVER wanted to go through that, so I sweated bullets every intercept to stay way ahead of the power curve and GET the kills instead of giving them - - I very much LOVED to go against AWACS. Though they had look-down \"God's eye\" view, there were some things inherent to their systems and training that could be exploited. Can't say anything beyond that, but I never lost a kill in 10 years to fighters being controlled by AWACS - - - YEH!! Wandering and Wondering",

Well, it had some disadvantages with ground clutter and such, but it was instantaneous \"real time\" raw radar, with a little symbology superimposed on top. The newer radars are even better, I guess - but to put it simply. I could remain ahead of the power curve and be certain my adversary was always behind it. With jets traveling at 500+ knots, that was a huge advantage all the way from \"way out\" to the merge - - \"Fight's on Cameras on!!\" Wandering and Wondering",
