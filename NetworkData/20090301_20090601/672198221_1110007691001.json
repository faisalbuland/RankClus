How Many NCO's are there in the US Military? How many have been accused of Criminality? How many have been Convicted? whats the percentage to the total NCO force? Have you ever served one hour in Todays Military? If I said all Vietnam Vets were Baby Killers would that be a Gross Vile Generalization?

If the accusation is true, try them in a court of law If found guilty, strip them of all benefits and throw them in Prison to rot for the Max time allowable(If there isnt a death penalty at Leavenworth) Very good It does seem like some forget what other service members have done in the past.
