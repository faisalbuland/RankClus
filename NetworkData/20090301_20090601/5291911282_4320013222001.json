Moms and Dads are flocking towards recruiting offices to find a legitimate way of keeping their kids and themselves form starving - - That said, you need to find a peer group you can fit into in your community of other left behind spouses, and support eachother. Get together often, shop together, help eachother tend kids, cry on eachother's shoulders - literally. Most units have spouse support groups exactly for that purpose. Find yours. If your unit doesn't have one, it should!! Get with the commander and organize one! Get a phone list of other spouses, and start connecting. Whining here won't help much, because we are all too far away. We can turn a ear, but we just as well be on the moon for real face to face help - get with local folk and GO ACTIVE!!

You will find a lot of ladies who are in your shoes too. As I have been told by my mom, \"For every great guy, there is always a strong woman behind him\". And that strong woman needs her support too. Go find these support groups and talk to them in person. It will help you. They will help you to do things when you are to tired or depressed to to anything.",

In some ways it is probbly harder on them since they don't know what is going on where their spouse is in the combat zone. One of the COMPASS mentors at our base has a saying that each deployment can be your easiest and your worst. Each deployment is different and effects the family differently. I also believe that it is the same for the couple. For each person there are aspects of a deployment that are easier and some that are worse. The very worst thing either person can do is focus on the negative and play the \"grass is greener\" game. My husband and I acknowledge that we each have good days and bad days and even if we are half a world apart we try to be there for each other and support each other. While we don't get the big kudos or the parades I do believe that there are many people out there ready to support the spouses but just don't know how. I don't need the kudos or the parades, I just need people to be my friends and be there when I have a bad day. I need friends that will take care of my kids either when I go to meet my husband or if there is an emergency. I need people that can be the taxi driver for my kids when I can't. And guess what, in over 24 years of being a Navy wife I have found that from both civilian and military friends. Kathy",
