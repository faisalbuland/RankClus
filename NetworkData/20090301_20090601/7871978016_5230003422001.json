Two missiles \u2014 one ground-to-air, the other ground-to-ship \u2014 with a range of about 80 miles (130 kilometers) were test-fired from an east coast launchpad, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, citing an unidentified government official.

China said it \"resolutely opposed\" North Korea's test and urged Pyongyang to return to talks on ending its atomic programs. Russia, once a key backer of North Korea, condemned the test. Moscow's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, the current Security Council president, said the 15-member council would begin work \"quickly\" on a new resolution.

North Korea's nuclear test raises worries that it could act as a facilitator of the atomic ambitions of other nations and potentially even terrorists.
