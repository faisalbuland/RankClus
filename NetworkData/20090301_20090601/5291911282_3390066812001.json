If the retraining advisory shows that there are no slots open (in fact it doesn't show the AFSC on the advisory at all), that means that there are no open positions, correct? So if you have a retraining package up for review for that particular career field, then isn't it just a waste of an application package? It's getting ready to be sent up for review number two, but should the application just be withdrawn and we go for BOP instead while the window is open? **On a side note, at the time the application was initially submitted, there were slots available.**",
