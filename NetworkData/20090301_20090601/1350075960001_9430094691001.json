I am in Washington DC area now, just relaxing after 7 months in Afghanistan, without one day off. (We work 7 days a week there). I will be flying down to Tampa, FLA for a two-week training school. I will learn their systems, and then be flying back to either Iraq or Afghanistan (I do not have my duty station yet). Believe me- Iraq has a better quality of life. Better housing, better food, better recreation, and it is easier to get around the country as well. Afghanistan is growing so fast, that the housing and the rest of the infrastructure has not kept up with the growth.",
