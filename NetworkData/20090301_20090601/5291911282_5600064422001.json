If you are widely separated, you may be giving a week or two of \" in-route\" leave at the end of training which you can go home on... You must remember, leave is earned before it is granted, so you have to put in X amount of time before Y days of leave can be taken. You earn about 3 days of leave per month, I believe, to a total of 30 days a year. How much have you earned??? Wandering and Wondering",
