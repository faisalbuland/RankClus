The decision represents a potentially serious setback for Obama, who as a candidate vowed to close Guantanamo and who signed an executive order beginning the process soon after he took office. Obama had asked Congress for $80 million to close the facility, located on a U.S. military base in Cuba, by early 2010. Many Democrats see Guantanamo as an affront to the U.S. legal system and a symbol of Bush-era detainee policies, but they are increasingly wary about the next step, as yet undefined by Obama, of relocating the terrorism suspects who are detained at the site. As recently as last week, Senate Democrats had hoped to preserve a portion of Obama's Guantanamo funding request. But their resolve crumbled in the face of a concerted Republican campaign warning of dire consequences if some detainees ended up in prisons or other facilities in the United States, a possibility that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has acknowledged. \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/19/AR2009051903615.html?hpid=topnews\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

WHEN and IF WHEN you post something substantial I will think you answered it. McConnell is correct. Our prison systems are for US citizens and should stay as such. Nobody wants these terrorists or the extra headaches that go with them in their prisons. Now the Dems mainly Obama is the only one really wanting them out of GB. Let them stay, there is nothing wrong with leaving them there. Oh, i'm sorry we have to immediately remove them so we have a better image, give me a break. They are terrorist and treated as such. If they are in our prisons they will get the same treatment as you say. Everything will be paid for by us the American citizen. We will pay for the meals, their cells, their exercise time, and everything else. So to think they won't get an special treatment is naive on your part. Answer? Jack.....oh Jack...You there Jack?

I believe they should be treated as the common criminals that they are, no special rock-star treatment that they're currently getting (free-government paid quality health care, special religious oriented diets, prayer time several times a day, special laundry services and clothing, just to name a few of their priviledges), put them out in the general prison population and let the prisoners system of honor deal with the inevitable. I'm quite sure their status in a general prison population would be less than that of child rapist. In ther words, they wouldn't last to long. Problem solved. Answer? Anbar ... oh Anbar. You there Anbar? Jack your posts pretty much mean nothing on these threads anymore. I've stopped paying attention to you a while ago. You only praise Obama and blame Bush. WHEN and IF WHEN you post something substantial I will think you answered it. McConnell is correct. Our prison systems are for US citizens and should stay as such. Nobody wants these terrorists or the extra headaches that go with them in their prisons. Now the Dems mainly Obama is the only one really wanting them out of GB. Let them stay, there is nothing wrong with leaving them there. Oh, i'm sorry we have to immediately remove them so we have a better image, give me a break. They are terrorist and treated as such. If they are in our prisons they will get the same treatment as you say. Everything will be paid for by us the American citizen. We will pay for the meals, their cells, their exercise time, and everything else. So to think they won't get an special treatment is naive on your part. Answer? Jack.....oh Jack...You there Jack? No probably have your head so far up Obama's arse you can't talk right now. I see that when you get taken to school by guys like me, you start with the personal crap. I mean, I read it all the time here. You get owned and you don't even realize it. I can't get owned by somebody who never knows what they are talking about. Jack come on man...you post about the NRA and the 2nd amendment and EVERYBODY tells you that your full of it, but you actually believe that your right..that is what is funny. You just write to write man. Your not helping your cause you just write crap. Sometimes you have a good point, but mostly no. I'm not starting personal crap, you started that, i'm just replying. Your right I should be the better man and not get personal, but i'm just trying to help you out. Honestly, everytime someone writes about the Dems your post are about Bush or you just brush it off as if it doesn't matter. You never say one thing negative about the Dems as though they walk on water.

The decision represents a potentially serious setback for Obama, who as a candidate vowed to close Guantanamo and who signed an executive order beginning the process soon after he took office. Obama had asked Congress for $80 million to close the facility, located on a U.S. military base in Cuba, by early 2010. Many Democrats see Guantanamo as an affront to the U.S. legal system and a symbol of Bush-era detainee policies, but they are increasingly wary about the next step, as yet undefined by Obama, of relocating the terrorism suspects who are detained at the site. As recently as last week, Senate Democrats had hoped to preserve a portion of Obama's Guantanamo funding request. But their resolve crumbled in the face of a concerted Republican campaign warning of dire consequences if some detainees ended up in prisons or other facilities in the United States, a possibility that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has acknowledged. \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/19/AR2009051903615.html?hpid=topnews\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

I'm quite sure their status in a general prison population would be less than that of child rapist. In ther words, they wouldn't last to long. Problem solved. Answer? Anbar ... oh Anbar. You there Anbar? Jack your posts pretty much mean nothing on these threads anymore. I've stopped paying attention to you a while ago. You only praise Obama and blame Bush. WHEN and IF WHEN you post something substantial I will think you answered it. McConnell is correct. Our prison systems are for US citizens and should stay as such. Nobody wants these terrorists or the extra headaches that go with them in their prisons. Now the Dems mainly Obama is the only one really wanting them out of GB. Let them stay, there is nothing wrong with leaving them there. Oh, i'm sorry we have to immediately remove them so we have a better image, give me a break. They are terrorist and treated as such. If they are in our prisons they will get the same treatment as you say. Everything will be paid for by us the American citizen. We will pay for the meals, their cells, their exercise time, and everything else. So to think they won't get an special treatment is naive on your part. Answer? Jack.....oh Jack...You there Jack? No probably have your head so far up Obama's arse you can't talk right now. I see that when you get taken to school by guys like me, you start with the personal crap.

We will pay for the meals, their cells, their exercise time, and everything else. So to think they won't get an special treatment is naive on your part. Answer? Jack.....oh Jack...You there Jack? No probably have your head so far up Obama's arse you can't talk right now. I see that when you get taken to school by guys like me, you start with the personal crap. I mean, I read it all the time here. You get owned and you don't even realize it. I can't get owned by somebody who never knows what they are talking about. Jack come on man...you post about the NRA and the 2nd amendment and EVERYBODY tells you that your full of it, but you actually believe that your right..that is what is funny. You just write to write man. Your not helping your cause you just write crap. Sometimes you have a good point, but mostly no. I'm not starting personal crap, you started that, i'm just replying. Your right I should be the better man and not get personal, but i'm just trying to help you out. Honestly, everytime someone writes about the Dems your post are about Bush or you just brush it off as if it doesn't matter. You never say one thing negative about the Dems as though they walk on water. Your a funny guy I will give that to you. Its like dealing with a Far left outlawz....",

I believe they should be treated as the common criminals that they are, no special rock-star treatment that they're currently getting (free-government paid quality health care, special religious oriented diets, prayer time several times a day, special laundry services and clothing, just to name a few of their priviledges), put them out in the general prison population and let the prisoners system of honor deal with the inevitable. I'm quite sure their status in a general prison population would be less than that of child rapist. In ther words, they wouldn't last to long. Problem solved. Answer? Anbar ... oh Anbar. You there Anbar? Jack your posts pretty much mean nothing on these threads anymore. I've stopped paying attention to you a while ago. You only praise Obama and blame Bush. WHEN and IF WHEN you post something substantial I will think you answered it. McConnell is correct. Our prison systems are for US citizens and should stay as such. Nobody wants these terrorists or the extra headaches that go with them in their prisons. Now the Dems mainly Obama is the only one really wanting them out of GB. Let them stay, there is nothing wrong with leaving them there. Oh, i'm sorry we have to immediately remove them so we have a better image, give me a break. They are terrorist and treated as such.
