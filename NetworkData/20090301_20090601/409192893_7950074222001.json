        "content": "have the Democrats recently acquired one? Specter hints Kemp died of GOP agenda By Tom LoBianco (Contact) | Monday, May 4, 2009 Sen. Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania Democrat, said part of the reason that he left the Republican Party last week was disillusionment with its health-care priorities, and suggested that had the Republicans taken a more moderate track, Jack Kemp may have won his battle with cancer. Mr. Specter, responding to a question from CBS' Bob Schieffer over whether he had let down Pennsylvanians who wanted a Republican to represent them, said he thought his priorities were more in line with those of the Democrats. \"Well, I was sorry to disappoint many people. Frankly, I was disappointed that the Republican Party didn't want me as their candidate,\" Mr. Specter said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"But as a matter of principle, I'm becoming much more comfortable with the Democrats' approach. And one of the items that I'm working on, Bob, is funding for medical research.\" Mr. Specter continued: \"If we had pursued what President Nixon declared in 1970 as the war on cancer, we would have cured many strains. I think Jack Kemp would be alive today. And that research has saved or prolonged many lives, including mine.\" Mr. Kemp died Saturday of cancer. He had been the running mate of 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole. washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/04/specter-hints-kemp-died-of-gop-agenda/",

He had been the running mate of 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole. washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/04/specter-hints-kemp-died-of-gop-agenda/ Yea geee it only went from $3 billion during the end of Clinton to $4.7 billion by the end of Bush. Yea those damn republicans!!!! how dare they only increase the research spending by 1.7 BILLION dollars. With these billions going to banks and automotive companies right? Wait, can't blame the republicans for that, the Democrats have the house of congress. Oh well, guess I'll wait until they retake one of them in 2010 so I can blame them again. Todays politics remind me of an old saying. - \"Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?\" - Joseph Stalin",
