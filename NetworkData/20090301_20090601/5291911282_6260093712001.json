But I thought maybe some of you might want to see it, plus, I wanted to brag about my wife to you. My Hero I am writing this, because there is someone in my life, that gives me strength, and is the person who gets me through the tough times. My wife Debbie, is a husbands dream. I will give you some background on her and why she is THE best military spouse a man could have. I am in the Navy reserves, as a Seabee. In 2003, my Air-Det was deployed to Iraq. And again in 2007-08. I understand that thousands of active duty spouses go through this on a regular basis, but my wife had several strikes against her. We had just moved to a new house a few months previous, when I got my warning order. A new town, a 4 year old son, a six month old daughter, and a 16 year old step -daughter, that my ex-wife decided she couldn\u2019t handle about 2 months before I deployed. If this wasn\u2019t enough, as a reservist, she wasn\u2019t sure of military support or structure. Deb wouldn\u2019t know if I was an E-1 in the Air Force or a General in the Marines. (I am a Chief in the Navy). That has no interest to her. What she finds important, is that I am doing a much needed job and, she has supported me in my military endeavors. During both of my deployments to OIF, she was my rock. While running the gamut of emotions overseas, there were always things that I could count on. I knew my kids were being taken well care of, the house was going to be still standing, and I would have money in the bank. Those sound like small things, but we have all heard horror stories of troops returning home to absent spouses and no money. When I would find myself outside the wire, and things seemed hopeless or bleak, I would always think of Debbie, and how she is so tough, and I would continue to persevere. I was in charge of a 28 man convoy security team. Several times, I had guys on my team, tell me they wished their spouse/significant other was more like Deb. Not because she is beautiful, she is, but because of her attitude and demeanor. That feeling of pride is un-paralleled. People often call me and other service people their heroes. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong. We do a rough job, that needs doing, but we know the consequences and rewards. Spouses generally, and Deb specifically, do it to no fanfare or applause. Deb is my hero and my life. If I died today, my life would have been a success. She let me into her life and has honored me by sharing it with me. She is my wife, lover, confidant, and my best friend.",
