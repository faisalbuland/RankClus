From strategypage. quote: Virginia's Kid Brother March 10, 2009: The U.S. Navy continues to entertain an internal debate over the issue of just how effective non-nuclear submarines would be in wartime, and whether the U.S. should buy some of these non-nuclear boats itself. This radical proposal is based on two compelling factors. First, the U.S. Navy may not get enough money to maintain a force of 40-50 SSNs (attack subs.) Second, the quietness of modern diesel-electric boats puts nuclear subs at a serious disadvantage, especially in coastal waters. In an attempt to settle the matter, from 2005 to 2007, the United States leased a Swedish sub (Sweden only has five subs in service), and its crew, to help train American anti-submarine forces. This Swedish boat was a \"worst case\" scenario, an approach that is preferred for training. The Gotland class Swedish subs involved are small (1,500 tons, 200 feet long) and have a small crew of 25. The Gotland was based in San Diego, along with three dozen civilian technicians to help with maintenance. For many years before the Gotland arrived, the U.S. Navy had trained against Australian diesel-electric subs, and often came out second. The Gotland has one advantage over the Australian boats, because of its AIP system (which allows it to stay under water, silently, for several weeks at a time). Thus the Gotland is something of a worst case in terms of what American surface ships and submarines might have to face in a future naval war. None of America's most likely naval opponents (China, North Korea or Iran), have AIP boats yet, but they do have plenty of diesel-electric subs which, in the hands of skilled crews, can be pretty deadly. One solution to the problem would be a new French design, the Andrasta class coastal boats. The Andrastas are 855 ton, 153 foot long subs, with a crew of 19 (plus 8 passengers, usually commandos). The boat can stay underwater for up to five days. Surfaced, it can travel up to 5,400 kilometers, at slow (170 kilometers a day) speed. There are sufficient supplies on board to keep the boat out up to 30 days. Thus the Andrastas can be deployed, slowly, anywhere in the world. Most missions would be more like two weeks, before the boat returned to port, or a sub tender (a support ship carrying fuel, supplies, maintenance capabilities, and even relief crews). The Andrasta has six forward firing torpedo tubes, which can also carry mines or anti-ship missiles. There are no reloads, all the weapons are stored in the torpedo tubes.

I think the argument will be to paint em pink or green once made Hybrid has nothing to do with what you think. I talked about this a year ago when I finally could due to security issues. Basically, all NUC subs use a nuclear powerplant to heat water into steam. That steam then turns a turbine at very high RPM (8,000+). The Turbine is the prime mover (which is very loud). It goes to reduction gears (which are very loud) to then turn the propeller. The Nuclear-steam plant also provided power through generators (which are moderately loud). Basically, it is hard to make a NUC sub silent. Quiet, yes. But, not super quiet. D/E subs use a diesel engine to charge batteries. These batteries are what are used to run a DC motor that turns the propellers and provide power. When the batteries get low, the diesel engine must be turned on (super freaking loud). But, once the batteries are charged, the sub will run super quiet. D/E subs usually have to snorkel to start up their diesels, but with AIP that is no longer needed. Diesel boats are also slower, but this is mostly to conserve battery life between charges. Hybrids take the best from both platforms. They use a much smaller nuclear-steam plant that is used only to keep the batteries charged at all times. So, they are essentially a NUC/E. On a regular NUC, this plant and everything that comes with this type of propulsion take up 1/3 to 1/2 of the entire boat. That is a lot to maintain, a lot that can break and a lot to try to decouple from the hull. On a Hybrid, the entire plant takes up one space (roughly, 10x10x10). And, it offers all of the pros of both platforms without the cons. Now, this story is suggesting that they are going to buy from either Sweden or Australia. That may be true for the hull. But, I think that they would probably use this new Hybrid technology that the Chinese developed about 10 years ago. And, no Navy sonar shack has gotten a track or even a discrete freq off of one of the new Chinese hybrids yet. And, I do believe one of them is a boomer and the other two are fast attacks.

Well, the Navy has had a few pop up on them while I was in. We never got a track then. So, that leaves 3 classes of boats we never have gotten tonals off of. And, one of those is a D/E that has been around since the early 80s. As for the noise, you must remember that the noise has to couple to the hull, which in turn couples to the water. It is by far much easier to use decoupling methods on a smaller turbine that takes up 1 frame at the center of a boat than one that takes up a few frames over much of the breadth of a boat. That is the main advantage.",
