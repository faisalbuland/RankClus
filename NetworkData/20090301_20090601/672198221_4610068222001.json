Obama wants to make it easier for the unemployed to get Federal Pell Grants to help fund their education.

We will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage. \"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/john_mccains_acceptance_speech.html\" That was from John McCain's acceptance speech at the RNC. quote: At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now.

So tonight, I propose a series of measures called Jobs for the 21st Century.

The second was in 1862 which made the tax a graduated tax but the tax expired in 1866. In 1894, the \"Wilson-Gorham Tariff Act\" was passed which imposed a 2% income tax. Representative William Wilson and Senator Arthur Gorham were both Democrats, not Republicans. William Jennings Bryan fought for the income tax in 1896 during his \"Cross of Gold\" speech. He was the Democratic nominee for President, not a Republican. \"http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/\" quote: They tell us that this platform was made to catch votes.

It simply intends to put the burdens of government justly upon the backs of the people. I am in favor of an income tax.

They create one boondoggle (taxation of income) and realize they created a whole nuther boondoggle (citizens are required to work for life in jobs that have ever increasing salaries). Come back to the wisom of the founders ya'll, the problems were solved centuries ago, you liberals are just modernizing them, and that makes me leary of those that lead the liberal agenda, and what they are trying to accomplish. The ability to tax income was first suggested by a Republican Administration. The Supreme Court shot it down in 1895. So it was hardly \"created by Liberals.\" Since the Courts shot it down, the Republicans then pushed through the 16th Amendment which legalised taxes on Income. It was ratified in 1913, and yes, a Democrat was President, but it was proposed and PUSHED by Republicans. Dave", 
        "reply": " The first income tax that was passed was in 1861 to pay for the Civil War. The second was in 1862 which made the tax a graduated tax but the tax expired in 1866. In 1894, the \"Wilson-Gorham Tariff Act\" was passed which imposed a 2% income tax. Representative William Wilson and Senator Arthur Gorham were both Democrats, not Republicans. William Jennings Bryan fought for the income tax in 1896 during his \"Cross of Gold\" speech. He was the Democratic nominee for President, not a Republican. \"http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/\" quote: They tell us that this platform was made to catch votes.

Are you saying that America should only invest in the top 20% of this population who were blessed with the talents, skills, and accelerated learning curve needed to serve in the Armed Forces? So, if a person can't serve because of a previous removal of a brain tumor, or has other types of diagnosis, like manic depression, than that person is out of luck because they're not worth the investment right? The right to earn a living and have upward social mobility should only be reserved to people who were blessed with great genes and accelerated learning curves and other talents and skills, and the rest of us should be good citizens and struggle the best we can with no help right? quote: Originally posted by SUNLINER81: A \"G.I.

It did not become unconstitutional until one judge changed his mind; and we cannot be expected to know when a judge will change his mind. The income tax is a just law.
