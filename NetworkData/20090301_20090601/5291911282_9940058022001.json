Jefferson, the man who was having children by his slave mistress while his wife was dying - There's a real paragon of virture for you. Jefferson also had a very public affair with a French General's wife while acting as America's diplomat in France. He had his daughter with him there at times while carrying on that affair - what a nice fatherly example. As for Hamilton, he all too Publicly admitted to his short moral indiscretion in an essay pamphlet, which he published at his own expense. As for his allegations against Aaron Burr, they were call factual. Aaron Burr was a money-grasping, ladder climbing jerk, and Hamilton had no problem or error in making that public. His error was supporting Burr's attempt to be elected President, not to get him elected, but to block Jefferson, which he almost managed to do. One must understand that Jefferson's surrogate, Madison, had manipulated the Constitution to keep Hamilton from ever running for President. There was only one Founding Father who was under 35 and not Native Born at the Constitutional Convention, and that was Alexander Hamilton - 34 and born in the Caribbean. Don't forget either that Jefferson was the leader of the Anti-Federalist faction that tried to sabotage the Constitution's ratification at every turn, and almost managed it... So it was Jefferson who started rumors that Hamilton had insult Burr, his Vice President, in some way. Jefferson also made and published anonymous allegations that Hamilton was an illegitimate son of a black Carribean prostitute by a white businessman, which may very well have been true, but it showed how racist and low-thinking Jefferson was! Jefferson hated both Burr and Hamilton - New Yorkers - as modernists who would support big business instead of the planters. He festered the wound between them by buying a newspaper an publishing anonymous essays and editorials attacking them both. He was the consummate back-stabber. Burr finally challenged Hamilton to a duel, common for the times, and Hamilton, a courageous Revolutionary War Veteran, would have been labeled a slanderer and a coward had he refused. Hamilton was an excellent shot and could have killed Burr easily, but he delayed the event, hoping Burr would learn he was being duped by Jefferson - and that is when Hamilton published the essay the scrupulously detailed his own indiscretion and sorrow for it. But Burr would not be satisfied because both Jefferson and Madison kept goading him on. It was also during this time that Hamilton's own son accept a duel and was killed, breaking his heart - - Finally, when the day of the duel did arrive and the two men faced each other on a small island outside of New York to avoid local laws against dueling....Hamilton said words to the effect, \"Sir, you are not worthy my bullet!\" He took aim at a nearby tree, and fired his pistol. Burr, either unaware that he could do the same thing and it would all be over, or simply full of vindictive hate - took aim, but was a poor shot. His bullet hit Hamilton in the belly, and it took about 36 hours to die at his home, with his wife and remaining children at his his side as he comforted them, apologizing for all the grief he had brought them, then died. As for Vice President Burr, he fled the country under charges of murder. He engaged in a conspiracy to steal the Western Territories and set up some kind of Monarchy. He was arrested by Andrew Jackson and sent back to Washington to be tried for murder and treason... But Jefferson already had what he wanted. The only person who could really challenge him, Hamilton, was dead; and Burr had been so discredited and dishonored that a public trial might only bring out the truth of it all and cause him and Madison embarrassment. The charges simply melted away and so did Burr - - And Jefferson had the Country and the Constitution, both of which he had opposed with all his might, to do with as he wished - - Can't beat that - - At least Hamilton had a smattering of integrity to the day he died. Can't say that for many that survived him - - Wandering and Wondering",

Well, I think about half of them would be so off balance not having slave labor around to earn their daily living for them that they'd be hard put do much for a while. The other half would become so enamored with the way banks and big business runs the country at the expense of everyone else that they would slide right in and make themselves at home. They weren't saints, boys and girls; they were lawyers, judges, slave owners, and the big businessmen of the era. And most of what they did in the Constitution was to protect their class and keep the power there.

He had his daughter with him there at times while carrying on that affair - what a nice fatherly example. As for Hamilton, he all too Publicly admitted to his short moral indiscretion in an essay pamphlet, which he published at his own expense.

His error was supporting Burr's attempt to be elected President, not to get him elected, but to block Jefferson, which he almost managed to do.

So it was Jefferson who started rumors that Hamilton had insult Burr, his Vice President, in some way. Jefferson also made and published anonymous allegations that Hamilton was an illegitimate son of a black Carribean prostitute by a white businessman, which may very well have been true, but it showed how racist and low-thinking Jefferson was! Jefferson hated both Burr and Hamilton - New Yorkers - as modernists who would support big business instead of the planters. He festered the wound between them by buying a newspaper an publishing anonymous essays and editorials attacking them both. He was the consummate back-stabber. Burr finally challenged Hamilton to a duel, common for the times, and Hamilton, a courageous Revolutionary War Veteran, would have been labeled a slanderer and a coward had he refused. Hamilton was an excellent shot and could have killed Burr easily, but he delayed the event, hoping Burr would learn he was being duped by Jefferson - and that is when Hamilton published the essay the scrupulously detailed his own indiscretion and sorrow for it. But Burr would not be satisfied because both Jefferson and Madison kept goading him on. It was also during this time that Hamilton's own son accept a duel and was killed, breaking his heart - - Finally, when the day of the duel did arrive and the two men faced each other on a small island outside of New York to avoid local laws against dueling....Hamilton said words to the effect, \"Sir, you are not worthy my bullet!\" He took aim at a nearby tree, and fired his pistol. Burr, either unaware that he could do the same thing and it would all be over, or simply full of vindictive hate - took aim, but was a poor shot. His bullet hit Hamilton in the belly, and it took about 36 hours to die at his home, with his wife and remaining children at his his side as he comforted them, apologizing for all the grief he had brought them, then died. As for Vice President Burr, he fled the country under charges of murder. He engaged in a conspiracy to steal the Western Territories and set up some kind of Monarchy. He was arrested by Andrew Jackson and sent back to Washington to be tried for murder and treason... But Jefferson already had what he wanted. The only person who could really challenge him, Hamilton, was dead; and Burr had been so discredited and dishonored that a public trial might only bring out the truth of it all and cause him and Madison embarrassment.
