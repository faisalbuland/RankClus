Jim Demint(R)SC attempted to shoot down a clause in the Stimulus Bill that forbids any and all \"religious gatherings\" if a person on entity accepts even one dime for update or repair using the funds from the Stimulus. Coming soon to a neighborhood near you. (this includes but is not limited to college campuses or Court Houses or..the list is endless).",

Howard Thompson Jr. had preached at weekly worship services at the New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) for more than a decade when prison officials last year issued, without any reason, a blanket ban on all preaching by inmates, even when done under the direct supervision of prison staff.\" ------------------------------------------------ \"Battle to feed hungry at church goes on Lawyer brought in at ACLU request seeks quick hearing on McKeesport's variance denial Thursday, January 11, 2007 By Ruth Ann Dailey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette McKeesport doesn't want the bad publicity, and Linda Foster doesn't want any publicity at all. It seems the two sides should be able to reach an understanding before a judge does it for them, but it might come to that. There's a lesson for Allegheny County's other municipalities in their battle, and there's a welcome reminder for the religious faithful that, sometimes, the American Civil Liberties Union works as hard to keep government out of religion as it works to keep religious expression out of, well, everywhere else. Ms. Foster had been running a Wednesday night meal program in the basement of Trinity Church of God in Christ until shortly before Thanksgiving. With donated money and volunteers, she'd been feeding about 25 needy people, many of them residents of the McKeesport YMCA, once a week for six years without any incident.\" --------------------------------------------------- \"ACLU Files Suit to Protect Free Speech Rights of Christian Protestor and Overturn Natchitoches Ordinance Requiring Permit for Such Activity ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For immediate release October 26, 2006 NATCHITOCHES, LA--Today the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana filed a lawsuit on behalf of a lone protestor who was denied his free expression rights by the City of Natchitoches. Edwin Crayton, a devout Christian, sought to stand in front of Wal-Mart in Natchitoches with a sign protesting Wal-Mart's alleged position on gay marriage. \"Government violates the principles in the First Amendment when it puts an overbroad permit scheme in place to restrain free speech in a public place,\" according to Joe Cook, Executive Director, ACLU of Louisiana. \"The sweep of the ordinance is so wide that it could encompass a chance meeting on the street corner by two strangers.\" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACLU of Georgia and Baptist Church File Religious Discrimination Lawsuit Zoning Ordinance Illegally Bars Church from Establishing House of Worship in East Point, ACLU Says ATLANTA - The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia today filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the Tabernacle Community Baptist Church, charging that the city of East Point, Georgia violated a federal religious discrimination law when it denied the church a zoning permit needed to establish its house of worship. \u201cWe simply want a permanent house of worship, where church members can gather for ministry, education and fellowship,\u201d said Nathaniel Smiley, pastor at the Tabernacle Community Baptist Church. \u201cThe East Point property is perfect for our church and we don\u2019t believe that we should be denied the ability to move in because we are a church.\u201d ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACLU of New Jersey Joins Lawsuit Supporting Second-Grader's Right to Sing \"Awesome God\" at Talent Show NEWARK, NJ -- The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey today announced that it is seeking to participate as a friend-of-the-court in the case of a second-grade student who was barred from singing a religious song in a voluntary, after-school talent show. \"There is a distinction between speech by a school and speech by individual students,\" said ACLU of New Jersey cooperating attorney Jennifer Klear of Drinker, Biddle & Reath in New York City. \"The Constitution protects a student's individual right to express herself, including the right to express herself religiously.\" And many more cases here >>http://www.aclufightsforchristians.com/ --Savage",

And if they fail to pay for the MUP, the county official reportedly warned, the couple will be charged escalating fines beginning at $100, then $200, $500, $1000, \"and then it will get ugly.\" Wonder if the ACLU will back a Christian cause for once? Not likely!!",

Howard Thompson Jr. had preached at weekly worship services at the New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) for more than a decade when prison officials last year issued, without any reason, a blanket ban on all preaching by inmates, even when done under the direct supervision of prison staff.\" ------------------------------------------------ \"Battle to feed hungry at church goes on Lawyer brought in at ACLU request seeks quick hearing on McKeesport's variance denial Thursday, January 11, 2007 By Ruth Ann Dailey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette McKeesport doesn't want the bad publicity, and Linda Foster doesn't want any publicity at all. It seems the two sides should be able to reach an understanding before a judge does it for them, but it might come to that. There's a lesson for Allegheny County's other municipalities in their battle, and there's a welcome reminder for the religious faithful that, sometimes, the American Civil Liberties Union works as hard to keep government out of religion as it works to keep religious expression out of, well, everywhere else. Ms. Foster had been running a Wednesday night meal program in the basement of Trinity Church of God in Christ until shortly before Thanksgiving. With donated money and volunteers, she'd been feeding about 25 needy people, many of them residents of the McKeesport YMCA, once a week for six years without any incident.\" --------------------------------------------------- \"ACLU Files Suit to Protect Free Speech Rights of Christian Protestor and Overturn Natchitoches Ordinance Requiring Permit for Such Activity ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For immediate release October 26, 2006 NATCHITOCHES, LA--Today the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana filed a lawsuit on behalf of a lone protestor who was denied his free expression rights by the City of Natchitoches. Edwin Crayton, a devout Christian, sought to stand in front of Wal-Mart in Natchitoches with a sign protesting Wal-Mart's alleged position on gay marriage. \"Government violates the principles in the First Amendment when it puts an overbroad permit scheme in place to restrain free speech in a public place,\" according to Joe Cook, Executive Director, ACLU of Louisiana. \"The sweep of the ordinance is so wide that it could encompass a chance meeting on the street corner by two strangers.\" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACLU of Georgia and Baptist Church File Religious Discrimination Lawsuit Zoning Ordinance Illegally Bars Church from Establishing House of Worship in East Point, ACLU Says ATLANTA - The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia today filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the Tabernacle Community Baptist Church, charging that the city of East Point, Georgia violated a federal religious discrimination law when it denied the church a zoning permit needed to establish its house of worship. \u201cWe simply want a permanent house of worship, where church members can gather for ministry, education and fellowship,\u201d said Nathaniel Smiley, pastor at the Tabernacle Community Baptist Church. \u201cThe East Point property is perfect for our church and we don\u2019t believe that we should be denied the ability to move in because we are a church.\u201d ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACLU of New Jersey Joins Lawsuit Supporting Second-Grader's Right to Sing \"Awesome God\" at Talent Show NEWARK, NJ -- The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey today announced that it is seeking to participate as a friend-of-the-court in the case of a second-grade student who was barred from singing a religious song in a voluntary, after-school talent show. \"There is a distinction between speech by a school and speech by individual students,\" said ACLU of New Jersey cooperating attorney Jennifer Klear of Drinker, Biddle & Reath in New York City. \"The Constitution protects a student's individual right to express herself, including the right to express herself religiously.\" And many more cases here >>http://www.aclufightsforchristians.com/ --Savage",

Howard Thompson Jr. had preached at weekly worship services at the New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) for more than a decade when prison officials last year issued, without any reason, a blanket ban on all preaching by inmates, even when done under the direct supervision of prison staff.\" ------------------------------------------------ \"Battle to feed hungry at church goes on Lawyer brought in at ACLU request seeks quick hearing on McKeesport's variance denial Thursday, January 11, 2007 By Ruth Ann Dailey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette McKeesport doesn't want the bad publicity, and Linda Foster doesn't want any publicity at all. It seems the two sides should be able to reach an understanding before a judge does it for them, but it might come to that.

Tell the congregants to find a better place to park. Maybe their failure to get a permit was an oversight on their part - I sure as heck wouldn't have thought of it on my own. The decent thing to do is to correct that oversight, and the neighborly thing to do is to work out a compromise with any potentially ticked off neighbors. Some of you who have not been to southern California (or lived there, like I have) just do not understand how bad of an issue parking can be in a place with no real public transportation. Were they doing this study in Pacific Beach? Point Loma? North Park? The mind reels at potential parking problems that would rightfully *tick off residents.
