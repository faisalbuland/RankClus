Public health care in China has been underfunded for years, and the high cost and poor availability of services are among the biggest complaints of the Chinese public. China is pumping in 850 billion yuan ($124 billion) to reform the ailing system in the next three years as part of an ambitious - and still only hazily outlined - plan to provide basic medical coverage and insurance to all of China's 1.3 billion people. \"By 2011, we will remarkably improve the accessibility of basic medical care and health care services and alleviate the burden of the general public for medical costs,\" Vice Health Minister Zhang Mao said at a briefing for reporters. The reforms also include plans to build 29,000 new township hospitals, and 2,000 at the county level. >http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/08/health/main4929186.shtml",
