Here is a forum that I suggest you visit Parent of Servicemembers Now, the short answer is \u201cNO!\u201d unless it can be established that you are dependent upon the member for more than 50 of your support. Much like if he can claim you on his tax return you don\u2019t qualify. Last week I attended AF BMT graduation at Lackland. The air force gave a briefing to new airman and their families that specifically covered that question. I was a little confused by your opening statement new mom of Airman 1st class Michael is that to mean that he is new or that your are his new mom? I assume it is that he is new. We all wish you and Michael both the very best of every thing, Please keep us posted. God and the soldier, All men adore, In time of trouble, And no more; For when war is over, And all things righted, God is neglected - The old soldier slighted.
