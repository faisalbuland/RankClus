And here lies a moral dilemma that is being ignored: President Obama willingly accepted donations from AIG to his presidential campaign last year, and now this year he has handed-over billions of our tax dollars to the company. Was it a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d \u201creturn the favor\u201d move from Obama? The situation certainly entails a conflict of interests. Given this, and given his recent desire to play the \u201cgive the money back\u201d game, President Obama needs to start by giving back to AIG the money they gave him for his campaign. Sadly, there is no evidence that President Obama has any intention or desire to resolve this ethical dilemma. Our government is also morally culpable for the \u201cterms\u201d of the AIG bailout. Ever since the bonus payouts to AIG employees became a \u201ccontroversy\u201d in the media, President Obama has insisted that he knew \u201cnothing,\u201d prior to authorizing the bailout funds, about AIG\u2019s contractual obligations to pay bonuses to their executives, and has expressed indignation over the matter. Yet last Wednesday, Senator Christopher Dodd stated on CNN that indeed, he and \u201cthe administration\u201d knew very well that AIG had obligations to pay bonuses to their executives, that he (Dodd) attempted to legislatively prevent those bonuses from being paid, and that \u201cthe administration\u201d pressured him to not prevent the bonus payments. So Senator Dodd and President Obama are saying different things about our government\u2019s relationship to AIG. Both stories may be false, but they cannot both be true at the same time. If one of these men is speaking truthfully, then the other is lying. Worse yet has been the public response from President Obama and members of Congress to taxpayer outrage. In a spectacular game of \u201cCYA,\u201d President Obama, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Congressman Barney Frank, Senator Christopher Dodd, and Republican Senator Chuck Grassley (just to name a few) have all sought to deflect criticism of themselves for spending billions of our dollars on a failing corporation, by making 73 AIG executives the object of public scorn. Nothing is known publicly about the bonus recipients themselves. Yet it is probable that, despite the overall failure of the AIG \"team,\" the anonymous 73 had to achieve some significant individual goals to qualify for a bonus. OJ Simpson was once a record-setting, history making, hall-of-famer, \u201cbonus worthy\u201d running back, yet nearly his entire NFL career was spent with a \u201cfailed\u201d team called the Buffalo Bills. The situation with the AIG executives is likely similar. But details don\u2019t matter for power-hungry politicians. To divert negative attention from themselves, President Obama and members of Congress have begun a process of \u201coccupational profiling.\u201d The idea of singling-out Americans according to their ethnicity for special government harassment and punishment - - \u201cracial profiling\u201d - - is abhorrent. But the leaders of our government have singled-out anyone with the word \u201cexecutive\u201d in their job title, for very ugly treatment. President Obama is correct to say that there are \u201cmoral and ethical\u201d issues entailed in this mess. Americans need to focus on what those issues truly are.",
