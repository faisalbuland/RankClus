Most of the games they thought up to entertain us were silly games but it certainly was nice to see American Women and it took our minds off the war for an hour. Some of them recorded the newest rock music before they left the States and played it for us when they landed in the field. Made us all homesick. Hope all of them made it home okay.",

They brought a few dozen boxes of donuts and our mess provided the fresh coffee which was especially welcome during the cold winter months. They usually stayed for an hour or so and brought games, newspapers, magazines and provided conversation to the troops. This was a great morale booster as for many of the troops as it was the only American females they had contact with during their entire 13 month tour.

I can\u2019t blame them, the field was not a safe place to be, not even a fire support base. There was a Donut Dolly who came to a Wolfhound Reunion I attented. I think her name was Susan.",
