I've been wondering, does this happen every time your government switches from Democrat to Republican and vice versa? From here, halfway across the globe, it looks like everything's gone upside down, even on this very forum. I know it's none of my business - I'm just curious. The tinfoil hats changed places (mass media, and on this forum), the bashing of the administration and criticism of unconstructive bashing (especially on this forum), distrust of government - everything just switched sides so smoothly I have to think it's just something you are used to. Is it something that comes with a two-party system?",

Is it something that comes with a two-party system? Pretty much. There are those that are bitterly partisan and will blame the other side no matter who is in power. There are those who will blame whoever is in power, no matter which side is in power. There are those who support whoever is in power, no matter which side they are (only about 1 or 2 of those). Then there are those who don't care who is in power it is the governments fault. The first category is by far the largest.",
