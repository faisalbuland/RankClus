All I was saying, was that Jessie would have caught hell if he hadn't qualified BUD'S=SEALS/UDT, and was getting away with wearing something unauthorized. I remember well the old UDT badges did not incorporate the \"eagle.\" Enlisted personnel also wore a silver version of both SEAL/UDT badges. Now, the SEAL badge is in gold for both officer/enlisted. Now, I've got a question for you. For those in SEAL training, must they qualify first in winning their Navy/MC gold jump wings, before they complete their SEAL training to win the trident? No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

Since we waterboard our troops to prepare them for torture while in captivity, that means it's ok to do it to our captives. First of all in aint torture and secondly yes, it is ok.
