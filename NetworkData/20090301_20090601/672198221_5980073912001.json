OMB Has \"Serious Concerns\"... \"WASHINGTON - Just months before the start of last year's stock market collapse, the federal agency that insures the retirement funds of 44 million Americans departed from its conservative investment strategy and decided to put much of its $64 billion insurance fund into stocks. Switching from a heavy reliance on bonds, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation decided to pour billions of dollars into speculative investments such as stocks in emerging foreign markets, real estate, and private equity funds. The agency refused to say how much of the new investment strategy has been implemented or how the fund has fared during the downturn. The agency would only say that its fund was down 6.5 percent - and all of its stock-related investments were down 23 percent - as of last Sept. 30, the end of its fiscal year. But that was before most of the recent stock market decline and just before the investment switch was scheduled to begin in earnest. No statistics on the fund's subsequent performance were released. Nonetheless, analysts expressed concern that large portions of the trust fund might have been lost at a time when many private pension plans are suffering major losses. The guarantee fund would be the only way to cover the plans if their companies go into bankruptcy. \"The truth is, this could be huge,\" said Zvi Bodie, a Boston University finance professor who in 2002 advised the agency to rely almost entirely on bonds. \"This has the potential to be another several hundred billion dollars. If the auto companies go under, they have huge unfunded liabilities\" in pension plans that would be passed on to the agency. In addition, Peter Orszag, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, has \"serious concerns\" about the agency, according to an Obama administration spokesman. Last year, as director of the Congressional Budget Office, Orszag expressed alarm that the agency was \"investing a greater share of its assets in risky securities,\" which he said would make it \"more likely to experience a decline in the value of its portfolio during an economic downturn the point at which it is most likely to have to assume responsibility for a larger number of underfunded pension plans.\"\" I would love to hear from all those Right Wingers who were going along with bush on putting Social Security monies into the stock market.

So now that you have been told the truth, time to get off the high horse. This isn't Social Security.

Belt, who favored putting only between 15 and 25 percent of the fund into stocks. Belt said in an interview that he operated under \"a more prudent risk management\" style and said he \"would have maintained the investment strategy we had in place.\" Belt left in 2006 and Millard arrived in 2007. Under Millard's strategy, the pension agency was directed to invest 55 percent of its funds in stocks and real estate. That included 20 percent in US stocks, 19 percent in foreign stocks, 6 percent in what the agency's records term \"emerging market\" stocks, 5 percent in private real estate and 5 percent in private equity firms...\" Now, considering the performance of our stock market and economy, what do you think has happened to all the funds in the PBGC? And to whom did it go? Another piece of the story: \"...Currently, the agency owes more in pension obligations than it has in funds, with an $11 billion shortfall as of last Sept. 30. Moreover, the agency might soon be responsible for many more pension plans. Most of the nation's private pension plans suffered major losses in 2008 and, all together, are underfunded by as much as $500 billion, according to Bodie and other analysts.

The following is taken from the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Retirement Fund Audited Financial Statements: http://www.defenselink.mil/comptroller/cfs/fy2005/12_Mi...ts%20and%20Notes.pdf \"The Fund receives income from three sources: monthly normal cost payments from the Services to pay for the current year\u2019s service cost; annual payments from Treasury to amortize the unfunded liability and pay for the increase in the normal cost attributable to Concurrent Receipt; and investment income. The Fund receives investment income from a variety of Treasury-based instruments such as bills, notes, bonds and overnight investment certificates. Treasury bills are short-term securities with maturities of less than one year issued at a discount. Treasury notes are intermediate securities with maturities of one to ten years. Treasury bonds are long-term debt instruments with maturities of greater than ten years. Overnight certificates are interest-based market securities purchased from the Treasury that mature the next business day and accrue interest based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey of Reserve repurchase agreement rates. The Fund also invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are indexed for inflation. TIPS are fixed-rate instruments designed to protect against inflation and the principal amount is indexed to the consumer price index (CPI) by adjusting the CPI at issuance to the current CPI; as inflation increases, so does the principal amount and the coupon. All of these instruments are debt obligations of the U.S Government and are backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the government. Debt obligations of the U.S. Government have virtually no risk of nonpayment of principal and interest at the specified due date.\" Think this one might have been shifted over to stocks, as well? I certainly hope not.",

Debt obligations of the U.S. Government have virtually no risk of nonpayment of principal and interest at the specified due date.\" Think this one might have been shifted over to stocks, as well? I certainly hope not.",

OMB Has \"Serious Concerns\"... \"WASHINGTON - Just months before the start of last year's stock market collapse, the federal agency that insures the retirement funds of 44 million Americans departed from its conservative investment strategy and decided to put much of its $64 billion insurance fund into stocks. Switching from a heavy reliance on bonds, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation decided to pour billions of dollars into speculative investments such as stocks in emerging foreign markets, real estate, and private equity funds. The agency refused to say how much of the new investment strategy has been implemented or how the fund has fared during the downturn. The agency would only say that its fund was down 6.5 percent - and all of its stock-related investments were down 23 percent - as of last Sept. 30, the end of its fiscal year. But that was before most of the recent stock market decline and just before the investment switch was scheduled to begin in earnest. No statistics on the fund's subsequent performance were released. Nonetheless, analysts expressed concern that large portions of the trust fund might have been lost at a time when many private pension plans are suffering major losses. The guarantee fund would be the only way to cover the plans if their companies go into bankruptcy. \"The truth is, this could be huge,\" said Zvi Bodie, a Boston University finance professor who in 2002 advised the agency to rely almost entirely on bonds. \"This has the potential to be another several hundred billion dollars. If the auto companies go under, they have huge unfunded liabilities\" in pension plans that would be passed on to the agency. In addition, Peter Orszag, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, has \"serious concerns\" about the agency, according to an Obama administration spokesman. Last year, as director of the Congressional Budget Office, Orszag expressed alarm that the agency was \"investing a greater share of its assets in risky securities,\" which he said would make it \"more likely to experience a decline in the value of its portfolio during an economic downturn the point at which it is most likely to have to assume responsibility for a larger number of underfunded pension plans.\"\" I would love to hear from all those Right Wingers who were going along with bush on putting Social Security monies into the stock market.

The Fund receives investment income from a variety of Treasury-based instruments such as bills, notes, bonds and overnight investment certificates. Treasury bills are short-term securities with maturities of less than one year issued at a discount. Treasury notes are intermediate securities with maturities of one to ten years. Treasury bonds are long-term debt instruments with maturities of greater than ten years. Overnight certificates are interest-based market securities purchased from the Treasury that mature the next business day and accrue interest based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey of Reserve repurchase agreement rates. The Fund also invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are indexed for inflation. TIPS are fixed-rate instruments designed to protect against inflation and the principal amount is indexed to the consumer price index (CPI) by adjusting the CPI at issuance to the current CPI; as inflation increases, so does the principal amount and the coupon. All of these instruments are debt obligations of the U.S Government and are backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the government.

Sweet Dreams... quote: FOLLOWING MONEY TO TAX HAVENS And guess who's turned up in a new government report about tax havens? Eleven giant recipients of your bailout tax dollars - American Express, AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, General Motors, GMAC, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. Together they've collected more than $227 billion. One favorite among the bailout companies is the Cayman Islands. There's no income tax, no corporate tax and no capital gains tax. Goldman Sachs has 15 subsidiaries there. Bank of America: 59. Citigroup: 90. But MORGAN STANLEY BEATS THEM ALL with at least 158 subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands - seven times the number of hotels. *http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/23/eveningnews/main4822689.shtml*",
