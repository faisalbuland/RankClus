Main one is 10 months of winter every year and it gets dark for long periods of time. The teen suicide rate is especailly high because of that. Then there is the alcohol that some choose to use to cover up their depression. It happens mostly in the bush but sometimes in Anchortown, Fairbanks and Junuea. It is a sad thing. Not everyone sees Alaska like I do. My favorite place on the planet. You should come visit this beautiful place cracker. Summer is the best time. Sun doesn't go down for a month and a half or so. Maybe it will help ease the obsession you seem to have for Alaska.",

The teen suicide rate is especailly high because of that. Then there is the alcohol that some choose to use to cover up their depression. It happens mostly in the bush but sometimes in Anchortown, Fairbanks and Junuea. It is a sad thing. Not everyone sees Alaska like I do. My favorite place on the planet. You should come visit this beautiful place cracker. Summer is the best time. Sun doesn't go down for a month and a half or so. Maybe it will help ease the obsession you seem to have for Alaska. Angel, I agree with you and crackerjacks can't come--apparently he doesn't get a vacation! Also, all the aticle speaks to is the 'rate'! It doesn't speak to the actual numbers so it boils down to limited math skills and another soap box issue! Early in my career, I made 4 deployments to Iceland. Similar weather patterns to Alaska exist there. Long Summers and long depressing Winters. The alcohol rate along with the suicide rate were high--guess when? In the winter! It is rough but here, it is all about survival of the fittest. Some people give up too easily. Cabin fever can be pretty bad for some. But I have learned, life is what you make it and the answer can be as simple as getting up and going outside. It just takes the right winter gear and a head light for your head. I find winter sled dog rides are the best, especially when the moon is full! Never been to Alaska but, I would love to go their some day... I hear that the hunting and fishing is spectacular... I know it may sound goofy but, I watch all the shows that I can about Alaska, especially any to do with hunting, fishing, flying and trucking and wish that I were a young man again, like I said, I guess I'm just an old goofy man, dreaming of adventures... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 You're never too old for Alaska Sunliner. You should come visit. The fish and hunting are spectacular. Afraid my old shot knees, hips, spine and shoulders, loaded with arthritis, won't let me any more... Heck, it's all that I can do, to get to the range around here and sit at a shooting bench and launch 150 grainer 30-06 at 100 and 500 yard targets and that's when it's in the upper eighties to about 105 degrees...

The suicide rate in Alaska has always been high. Two main factors are usually responsible. Main one is 10 months of winter every year and it gets dark for long periods of time. The teen suicide rate is especailly high because of that. Then there is the alcohol that some choose to use to cover up their depression. It happens mostly in the bush but sometimes in Anchortown, Fairbanks and Junuea. It is a sad thing. Not everyone sees Alaska like I do. My favorite place on the planet. You should come visit this beautiful place cracker. Summer is the best time. Sun doesn't go down for a month and a half or so. Maybe it will help ease the obsession you seem to have for Alaska. Angel, I agree with you and crackerjacks can't come--apparently he doesn't get a vacation! Also, all the aticle speaks to is the 'rate'! It doesn't speak to the actual numbers so it boils down to limited math skills and another soap box issue! Early in my career, I made 4 deployments to Iceland. Similar weather patterns to Alaska exist there. Long Summers and long depressing Winters. The alcohol rate along with the suicide rate were high--guess when? In the winter! It is rough but here, it is all about survival of the fittest. Some people give up too easily. Cabin fever can be pretty bad for some. But I have learned, life is what you make it and the answer can be as simple as getting up and going outside. It just takes the right winter gear and a head light for your head. I find winter sled dog rides are the best, especially when the moon is full! Never been to Alaska but, I would love to go their some day... I hear that the hunting and fishing is spectacular... I know it may sound goofy but, I watch all the shows that I can about Alaska, especially any to do with hunting, fishing, flying and trucking and wish that I were a young man again, like I said, I guess I'm just an old goofy man, dreaming of adventures... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 You're never too old for Alaska Sunliner. You should come visit. The fish and hunting are spectacular. Afraid my old shot knees, hips, spine and shoulders, loaded with arthritis, won't let me any more... Heck, it's all that I can do, to get to the range around here and sit at a shooting bench and launch 150 grainer 30-06 at 100 and 500 yard targets and that's when it's in the upper eighties to about 105 degrees... I can still dream though!... LOL Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
