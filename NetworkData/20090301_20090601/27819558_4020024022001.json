Bill Ritter of Colorado on Thursday signed the Designated Beneficiary Agreement Act, which allows unmarried adult couples -- including same-sex partners -- some of the legal rights afforded to married couples; the legislation delivers expanded rights in areas including inheritance matters, medical decisions, and hospital visitation. With an eye toward convenience, the law permits any two unmarried adults to designate each other as beneficiaries by filing a form with a county clerk. The legislation takes effect on July 1. Two openly gay members of the legislature, Sen. Jennifer Veiga and Rep. Mark Ferrandino, both Democrats from Denver, sponsored the legislation. It passed with minimal Republican support.

The Advocate Now THIS....would seem to be an example of the better way to pursue those things that gays want from society. Gay 'marriage' or even civil unions aren't necessary; rather, on both state & federal levels, laws can be modified to to permit couples of whatever orientation to take advantage to the same benefits granted to married people today. I've LONG been an advocate of changing our tax system in a way that doesn't reward folks who have dependents and penalizes those who don't.",

I've LONG been an advocate of changing our tax system in a way that doesn't reward folks who have dependents and penalizes those who don't. I agree with you to some extent. If DOMA is repealed and all FEDERAL benefits are granted, I can live with it. If some states choose not to grant STATE benefits, then I have a choice of whether or not to live in that state. However, those states that do not grant state benefits should in no way be able to curtail any federal benefits. (See IC....I know the art of compromise.)",
