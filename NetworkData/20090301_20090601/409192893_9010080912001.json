I watched an old rerun movie with Christopher Walken last night, and he made a statement I found interesting. Two mice fell in a bucket of cream. One mouse gave up and drowned, the other thrashed around refusing to give up, eventually the cream turned to butter and the mouse walked out. We are in a mess caused by incompetent/corrupt leadership. We elected a new president with new Ideas and now in 60 days we expect him to solve all the problems that took years to bring to this point. Second guessing him and his unconventional Ideas is counter productive. All that energy should have been focused on bringing the prior administration to justice and stopping them and thier cohorts cold in thier tracks instead of allowing them to walk away unacountable. Let this guy do his job/or not. Either he'll cure the cancer or well die as a nation. The nation was on its death bed long before he arrived and now will heal or die depending on his uncoventional treatment.",

When is enough... enough? ...and just think 95% of Americans were going to 500 bucks... I guess depreciation must have slipped in - cuz the average was what 11-13 bucks... Then consider his tax plan was already going into stratosphere BEFORE he was even elected... His tax plans was busting the 39.5% marker - with projections hitting 54.9%... All that and NOW he's quadrupled the deficit - so how does quadruple those taxes without causing a revolution...? But here's the fun part - 60% don't pay taxes already... So how is going to quadruple the taxes on 40% of the population while the other 60% pays NOTHING... Unemployment looks like the best job out there - just send the check - I'll spend it - just me that check...",
