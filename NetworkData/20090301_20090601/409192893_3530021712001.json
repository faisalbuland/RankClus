Throwing money around to aleviate the impact it has had on americans isnt going to fix the problem. Its like putting a band aid on a cancer. The problem must be attacked at its root cause. Its like the roof is leaking and were in the basement trying to fix it.

If someone can tell you that there are 12 to 20 million illegals here, that would imply that they're all accounted for, wouldn't it? So, why haven't they all been rounded up? Bet you never thought of that, did you? You might notice if you werent so defensive That between 12 to 20 million is quite a spread and obviously an estimate That has been constantly reported. so I might ask the same question where do you get your info from? And as far as finding and deporting that many people, The cost would be astronomical. However if the politicians really wanted them gone they would cut off all aid and fine heavily anyone who was found to employ or house them, and make schools responsible for checking green cards. They then would self deport at no costs to the taxpayers who have spent to much already. And to speed things up a bit they could offer rewards to whistle blowers. \"Infiltrated\"...are you serious? This \"infiltration\" you speak of has been facilitated by officials who allowed business owners to use illegals to keep their costs down. That is absolutely correct. And don't think that every Latino you see in a factory or on the street on a construction project is illegal. I never said they were did I? That's b.s. - but considering your attitudes toward nonwhites, not surprising. And don't start with that other nonsense you tried to peddle in the other thread. What attitude is that? And what nonsense are you refering to? A different view than yours?? And, how much would a head of lettuce cost if we gave Americans a living wage? A hell of a lot more than it costs now. I suggest you do the math. Didnt Chavez organized the grape growers and get them a living wage. Did the price of grapes become out of reach? \"What more can they possibly do for the black segment of society...\" What does that mean? What do \"Jessy and al\" have to do with this? It means theres not much more they can champion. They are the champions for the black community that lead the marches for equality, and foment unrest when police officer do thier jobs,But you already knew that so why do you ask? To make me appear rascist? Thats just not the case. You have a racial problem. You'd never admit it, but that was pretty well established on that other stupid thread. If I had a racial problem, why wouldnt I admitt It? do you actually think I would give a rats azz what you or other thought? Please dont flatter youself I say it the way it is and dont pull my punches. Fact is I have no problem with any race, only the individuals in all races that refuse to conform to society. You have a problem with brown people, pal. There are just too damned many of 'em running around. Some of you guys with this siege mentality of yours are really a pain in the ass. As I said and will repeat I have no problem with any race, Its the individuals who use the color of thier skin to sit on thier azzes for generations milk the system while crying Racisim and expect me to pay for it. And as far as to many running around I wouldnt notice that living in my lilly white Gated community as you would say. Get a grip McGreer you are you own worst enemy and a sensitive reverse rascist for finding fault with some of the things Ive made. Maybe they hit to close.",

Looks like we have one in the White House. An \"illegal\" what? As far as the illegal immigrant issue, it was used in 2004 as a means to hold up flagging political support - that's all. The majority of Americans and her elected officials don't really care about illegal immigration. If they did care, it would have been taken care of decades ago. They served as a nice means of cheap labor in this country for decades, and as long as your produce was cheap, you didn't care. As long as you had someone to do the dirty, low paying work you didn't want to do, you didn't care. Slavery was illegal, and they were the next best thing. They've been nothing more than indentured servants. I think this four-year \"outrage\" was fabricated, and, once again, a bunch of suckers got duped. Those illegals aren't going anywhere anytime soon, so you may as well face the facts and move on. There's nothing you can do about it. Cheap you say? What about the costs to school them give them medicaide,incarceration, and now social security benefits? How much more could a head of lettuce cost if we paid Americans a living wage? Why dont we just give them amnesty and reparations for thier indentured servatude. It would give Jessy and al something to do theve had plenty of practice and know the drill. Besides what more can they possibly do for the black segment of society they will soon be out of a job. These 12 to 20 million illegal aliens arent picking produce as you would like to portray we have that mechanized. They have infiltrated every segment of labor including all phases of construction,processing plants,slaughter houses meat packing, and they undermine American standards putting Americans out of work. The money they make is sent home and not circulated in the US many pay little or no tax. You got to be talking out your azz because your head knows better. When the vast majority of the nation wants them gone and the laws enforced thats what should be. Politicians work for us not the other way around, or so it should be. LOL Before you speak of someone who's talking from somewhere other than their mouths, you should take the time to educate yourself.

And then we had a heavy snow fall last week and at 72 it was to much for me and when the mexicans showed up I paid them 75 bucks to shovel, had no choice because local spoiled kids dont need the money.

Looks like we have one in the White House. An \"illegal\" what? As far as the illegal immigrant issue, it was used in 2004 as a means to hold up flagging political support - that's all. The majority of Americans and her elected officials don't really care about illegal immigration. If they did care, it would have been taken care of decades ago. They served as a nice means of cheap labor in this country for decades, and as long as your produce was cheap, you didn't care. As long as you had someone to do the dirty, low paying work you didn't want to do, you didn't care. Slavery was illegal, and they were the next best thing. They've been nothing more than indentured servants. I think this four-year \"outrage\" was fabricated, and, once again, a bunch of suckers got duped. Those illegals aren't going anywhere anytime soon, so you may as well face the facts and move on. There's nothing you can do about it. Cheap you say? What about the costs to school them give them medicaide,incarceration, and now social security benefits? How much more could a head of lettuce cost if we paid Americans a living wage? Why dont we just give them amnesty and reparations for thier indentured servatude. It would give Jessy and al something to do theve had plenty of practice and know the drill. Besides what more can they possibly do for the black segment of society they will soon be out of a job. These 12 to 20 million illegal aliens arent picking produce as you would like to portray we have that mechanized. They have infiltrated every segment of labor including all phases of construction,processing plants,slaughter houses meat packing, and they undermine American standards putting Americans out of work. The money they make is sent home and not circulated in the US many pay little or no tax. You got to be talking out your azz because your head knows better. When the vast majority of the nation wants them gone and the laws enforced thats what should be. Politicians work for us not the other way around, or so it should be. LOL Before you speak of someone who's talking from somewhere other than their mouths, you should take the time to educate yourself. News flash for you Mac I was well educated,Ivy league I might and had a 160+ IQ and always finished in the top 1% of any course I ever took. dont let the grammar and typos fool you.If you want me to be impressed by your education, you should post more intelligently. A person with an \"Ivy League\" education would, in most cases, apply more critical thinking to their thought processes. I don't know where you get your information - and I don't think I want to know, frankly - but you might do well to get some other sources. If someone can tell you that there are 12 to 20 million illegals here, that would imply that they're all accounted for, wouldn't it? So, why haven't they all been rounded up? Bet you never thought of that, did you? You might notice if you werent so defensive That between 12 to 20 million is quite a spread and obviously an estimate That has been constantly reported. so I might ask the same question where do you get your info from? And as far as finding and deporting that many people, The cost would be astronomical.But - isn't that what you want? However if the politicians really wanted them gone they would cut off all aid and fine heavily anyone who was found to employ or house them, and make schools responsible for checking green cards. They then would self deport at no costs to the taxpayers who have spent to much already. And to speed things up a bit they could offer rewards to whistle blowers. \"Infiltrated\"...are you serious? This \"infiltration\" you speak of has been facilitated by officials who allowed business owners to use illegals to keep their costs down. That is absolutely correct. And don't think that every Latino you see in a factory or on the street on a construction project is illegal. I never said they were did I?Not overtly - but, be honest: When you see a Latino in those places, do you think of illegal aliens? That's b.s. - but considering your attitudes toward nonwhites, not surprising. And don't start with that other nonsense you tried to peddle in the other thread. What attitude is that? And what nonsense are you refering to? A different view than yours??From your posts, especially in a previous thread, you appear have a habit of generalizing that is pretty close to, it not actually, prejudicial stereotyping. And, how much would a head of lettuce cost if we gave Americans a living wage? A hell of a lot more than it costs now.That's right - it's why it's better to get your cheap labor any way you can. Any ideas on who's been relied upon to do that? I suggest you do the math. Didnt Chavez organized the grape growers and get them a living wage. Did the price of grapes become out of reach? They didn't get out of reach, largely because of migrant farm workers who were being used as cheap labor. Chavez met a lot of resistance for his efforts, as I'm sure you know. And much of that resistance had to do with increased labor costs. \"What more can they possibly do for the black segment of society...\" What does that mean? What do \"Jessy and al\" have to do with this? It means theres not much more they can champion. They are the champions for the black community that lead the marches for equality, and foment unrest when police officer do thier jobs,But you already knew that so why do you ask? To make me appear rascist? Thats just not the case.Why do you keep using the term \"black community\" as though it were some sort of monolith, operating under a similar standard? That's a myth. Let it go. You have a racial problem. You'd never admit it, but that was pretty well established on that other stupid thread. If I had a racial problem, why wouldnt I admitt It? do you actually think I would give a rats azz what you or other thought? Please dont flatter youself I say it the way it is and dont pull my punches. Fact is I have no problem with any race, only the individuals in all races that refuse to conform to society.You'd be hard-pressed to actually prove that, given the tone and tenor of a lot of your posts. You have a problem with brown people, pal. There are just too damned many of 'em running around. Some of you guys with this siege mentality of yours are really a pain in the ass. As I said and will repeat I have no problem with any race, Its the individuals who use the color of thier skin to sit on thier azzes for generations milk the system while crying Racisim and expect me to pay for it.So, what' s up with all this talk about blacks, then? Have you not learned, through your Ivy League education, that virtually all Americans have a similar experience climbing up the American socioeconomic ladder? If you recognize that, you'd see the folly in trying to apply a group dynamic to it. It goes without saying that because of racial or ethnic uniqueness, some individuals or groups have had more difficulty, but that doesn't erase the fact that we all have common experiences here. And as far as to many running around I wouldnt notice that living in my lilly white Gated community as you would say. Get a grip McGreer you are you own worst enemy and a sensitive reverse rascist for finding fault with some of the things Ive made. Maybe they hit to close. THey hit \"close\" in that I'm tired of dealing with it - and to be honest, it was nice to live for 12 years without being one of the usual suspects, or being seen as \"exceptional\", or something similar. So - as I've accepted the fact that people like you still walk this Earth, it is still a drag to have to deal with it. Perhaps if I were my children's ages, it wouldn't be a problem. But, unlike them, I have memory of those things, and there are still people like me on the opposite side who play the same games, as well. Perhaps we should just hurry up and die or something...",

Looks like we have one in the White House. An \"illegal\" what? As far as the illegal immigrant issue, it was used in 2004 as a means to hold up flagging political support - that's all. The majority of Americans and her elected officials don't really care about illegal immigration. If they did care, it would have been taken care of decades ago. They served as a nice means of cheap labor in this country for decades, and as long as your produce was cheap, you didn't care. As long as you had someone to do the dirty, low paying work you didn't want to do, you didn't care. Slavery was illegal, and they were the next best thing.

What about the costs to school them give them medicaide,incarceration, and now social security benefits? How much more could a head of lettuce cost if we paid Americans a living wage? Why dont we just give them amnesty and reparations for thier indentured servatude. It would give Jessy and al something to do theve had plenty of practice and know the drill. Besides what more can they possibly do for the black segment of society they will soon be out of a job. These 12 to 20 million illegal aliens arent picking produce as you would like to portray we have that mechanized. They have infiltrated every segment of labor including all phases of construction,processing plants,slaughter houses meat packing, and they undermine American standards putting Americans out of work. The money they make is sent home and not circulated in the US many pay little or no tax. You got to be talking out your azz because your head knows better. When the vast majority of the nation wants them gone and the laws enforced thats what should be. Politicians work for us not the other way around, or so it should be. LOL Before you speak of someone who's talking from somewhere other than their mouths, you should take the time to educate yourself. News flash for you Mac I was well educated,Ivy league I might and had a 160+ IQ and always finished in the top 1% of any course I ever took. dont let the grammar and typos fool you.If you want me to be impressed by your education, you should post more intelligently. A person with an \"Ivy League\" education would, in most cases, apply more critical thinking to their thought processes. I don't know where you get your information - and I don't think I want to know, frankly - but you might do well to get some other sources. If someone can tell you that there are 12 to 20 million illegals here, that would imply that they're all accounted for, wouldn't it? So, why haven't they all been rounded up? Bet you never thought of that, did you? You might notice if you werent so defensive That between 12 to 20 million is quite a spread and obviously an estimate That has been constantly reported. so I might ask the same question where do you get your info from? And as far as finding and deporting that many people, The cost would be astronomical.But - isn't that what you want? However if the politicians really wanted them gone they would cut off all aid and fine heavily anyone who was found to employ or house them, and make schools responsible for checking green cards. They then would self deport at no costs to the taxpayers who have spent to much already. And to speed things up a bit they could offer rewards to whistle blowers. \"Infiltrated\"...are you serious? This \"infiltration\" you speak of has been facilitated by officials who allowed business owners to use illegals to keep their costs down. That is absolutely correct. And don't think that every Latino you see in a factory or on the street on a construction project is illegal. I never said they were did I?Not overtly - but, be honest: When you see a Latino in those places, do you think of illegal aliens? That's b.s. - but considering your attitudes toward nonwhites, not surprising. And don't start with that other nonsense you tried to peddle in the other thread. What attitude is that? And what nonsense are you refering to? A different view than yours??From your posts, especially in a previous thread, you appear have a habit of generalizing that is pretty close to, it not actually, prejudicial stereotyping. And, how much would a head of lettuce cost if we gave Americans a living wage? A hell of a lot more than it costs now.That's right - it's why it's better to get your cheap labor any way you can. Any ideas on who's been relied upon to do that? I suggest you do the math. Didnt Chavez organized the grape growers and get them a living wage. Did the price of grapes become out of reach? They didn't get out of reach, largely because of migrant farm workers who were being used as cheap labor. Chavez met a lot of resistance for his efforts, as I'm sure you know. And much of that resistance had to do with increased labor costs. \"What more can they possibly do for the black segment of society...\" What does that mean? What do \"Jessy and al\" have to do with this? It means theres not much more they can champion. They are the champions for the black community that lead the marches for equality, and foment unrest when police officer do thier jobs,But you already knew that so why do you ask? To make me appear rascist? Thats just not the case.Why do you keep using the term \"black community\" as though it were some sort of monolith, operating under a similar standard? That's a myth. Let it go. You have a racial problem. You'd never admit it, but that was pretty well established on that other stupid thread. If I had a racial problem, why wouldnt I admitt It? do you actually think I would give a rats azz what you or other thought? Please dont flatter youself I say it the way it is and dont pull my punches. Fact is I have no problem with any race, only the individuals in all races that refuse to conform to society.You'd be hard-pressed to actually prove that, given the tone and tenor of a lot of your posts. You have a problem with brown people, pal. There are just too damned many of 'em running around. Some of you guys with this siege mentality of yours are really a pain in the ass. As I said and will repeat I have no problem with any race, Its the individuals who use the color of thier skin to sit on thier azzes for generations milk the system while crying Racisim and expect me to pay for it.So, what' s up with all this talk about blacks, then? Have you not learned, through your Ivy League education, that virtually all Americans have a similar experience climbing up the American socioeconomic ladder? If you recognize that, you'd see the folly in trying to apply a group dynamic to it. It goes without saying that because of racial or ethnic uniqueness, some individuals or groups have had more difficulty, but that doesn't erase the fact that we all have common experiences here. And as far as to many running around I wouldnt notice that living in my lilly white Gated community as you would say. Get a grip McGreer you are you own worst enemy and a sensitive reverse rascist for finding fault with some of the things Ive made. Maybe they hit to close. THey hit \"close\" in that I'm tired of dealing with it - and to be honest, it was nice to live for 12 years without being one of the usual suspects, or being seen as \"exceptional\", or something similar. So - as I've accepted the fact that people like you still walk this Earth, it is still a drag to have to deal with it. Perhaps if I were my children's ages, it wouldn't be a problem. But, unlike them, I have memory of those things, and there are still people like me on the opposite side who play the same games, as well. Perhaps we should just hurry up and die or something...",

And as far as finding and deporting that many people, The cost would be astronomical.But - isn't that what you want? However if the politicians really wanted them gone they would cut off all aid and fine heavily anyone who was found to employ or house them, and make schools responsible for checking green cards. They then would self deport at no costs to the taxpayers who have spent to much already. And to speed things up a bit they could offer rewards to whistle blowers. \"Infiltrated\"...are you serious? This \"infiltration\" you speak of has been facilitated by officials who allowed business owners to use illegals to keep their costs down. That is absolutely correct. And don't think that every Latino you see in a factory or on the street on a construction project is illegal. I never said they were did I?Not overtly - but, be honest: When you see a Latino in those places, do you think of illegal aliens? That's b.s. - but considering your attitudes toward nonwhites, not surprising. And don't start with that other nonsense you tried to peddle in the other thread. What attitude is that? And what nonsense are you refering to? A different view than yours??From your posts, especially in a previous thread, you appear have a habit of generalizing that is pretty close to, it not actually, prejudicial stereotyping. And, how much would a head of lettuce cost if we gave Americans a living wage? A hell of a lot more than it costs now.That's right - it's why it's better to get your cheap labor any way you can. Any ideas on who's been relied upon to do that? I suggest you do the math. Didnt Chavez organized the grape growers and get them a living wage. Did the price of grapes become out of reach? They didn't get out of reach, largely because of migrant farm workers who were being used as cheap labor. Chavez met a lot of resistance for his efforts, as I'm sure you know. And much of that resistance had to do with increased labor costs. \"What more can they possibly do for the black segment of society...\" What does that mean? What do \"Jessy and al\" have to do with this? It means theres not much more they can champion. They are the champions for the black community that lead the marches for equality, and foment unrest when police officer do thier jobs,But you already knew that so why do you ask? To make me appear rascist? Thats just not the case.Why do you keep using the term \"black community\" as though it were some sort of monolith, operating under a similar standard? That's a myth. Let it go. You have a racial problem. You'd never admit it, but that was pretty well established on that other stupid thread. If I had a racial problem, why wouldnt I admitt It? do you actually think I would give a rats azz what you or other thought? Please dont flatter youself I say it the way it is and dont pull my punches. Fact is I have no problem with any race, only the individuals in all races that refuse to conform to society.You'd be hard-pressed to actually prove that, given the tone and tenor of a lot of your posts. You have a problem with brown people, pal. There are just too damned many of 'em running around. Some of you guys with this siege mentality of yours are really a pain in the ass. As I said and will repeat I have no problem with any race, Its the individuals who use the color of thier skin to sit on thier azzes for generations milk the system while crying Racisim and expect me to pay for it.So, what' s up with all this talk about blacks, then? Have you not learned, through your Ivy League education, that virtually all Americans have a similar experience climbing up the American socioeconomic ladder? If you recognize that, you'd see the folly in trying to apply a group dynamic to it. It goes without saying that because of racial or ethnic uniqueness, some individuals or groups have had more difficulty, but that doesn't erase the fact that we all have common experiences here. And as far as to many running around I wouldnt notice that living in my lilly white Gated community as you would say. Get a grip McGreer you are you own worst enemy and a sensitive reverse rascist for finding fault with some of the things Ive made. Maybe they hit to close. THey hit \"close\" in that I'm tired of dealing with it - and to be honest, it was nice to live for 12 years without being one of the usual suspects, or being seen as \"exceptional\", or something similar. So - as I've accepted the fact that people like you still walk this Earth, it is still a drag to have to deal with it. Perhaps if I were my children's ages, it wouldn't be a problem. But, unlike them, I have memory of those things, and there are still people like me on the opposite side who play the same games, as well. Perhaps we should just hurry up and die or something...",
