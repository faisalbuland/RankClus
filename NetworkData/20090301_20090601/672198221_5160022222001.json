Source: \"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7471217&page=1\" I agree Kegler. I read the article from your source and found a comment there that was appropriate: (Quote)As I peruse through these comments it appears to me that most of the liberals have no clue about reality and real survival. I would love to take a survey as to how many of them have actually served this country. I am not one for torture but then again I am not one for terrorizing. So lets see, leave it all to those who want us annihilated now that sounds logical to me. But then again I have never known a liberal who has ever considered logic. The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics. You can have your cities, your welfare your morals and whatever else you want and let's see who will survive? That I am afraid is what it is all going to be about in the future, our survival and be it as it may I know the first people who will come running to me when they are in need I will say to them you ignored the reality.

I would love to take a survey as to how many of them have actually served this country. I am not one for torture but then again I am not one for terrorizing. So lets see, leave it all to those who want us annihilated now that sounds logical to me. But then again I have never known a liberal who has ever considered logic. The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics. You can have your cities, your welfare your morals and whatever else you want and let's see who will survive?

The story is that these two psychologists were contracted by the Bush Administration to develop \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d procedures at $1,000 PER DAY. HOWEVER, THEY HAD NO EXPERIENCE AS INTERROGATORS. You want something to be pizzed about? The Bush Administration was so lame that they overpaid contractors to develop an illegal program, who did not have the expertise necessary to do the job. \u201cBut it turns out neither Mitchell nor Jessen had any experience in conducting actual interrogations before the CIA hired them. \"They went to two individuals who had no interrogation experience,\" said Col. Kleinman. \"They are not interrogators.\" The new documents show the CIA later came to learn that the two psychologists' waterboarding \"expertise\" was probably \"misrepresented\" and thus, there was no reason to believe it was \"medically safe\" or effective.\u201d",

I read the article from your source and found a comment there that was appropriate: (Quote)As I peruse through these comments it appears to me that most of the liberals have no clue about reality and real survival. I would love to take a survey as to how many of them have actually served this country. I am not one for torture but then again I am not one for terrorizing. So lets see, leave it all to those who want us annihilated now that sounds logical to me. But then again I have never known a liberal who has ever considered logic. The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics. You can have your cities, your welfare your morals and whatever else you want and let's see who will survive?

I would love to take a survey as to how many of them have actually served this country. I am not one for torture but then again I am not one for terrorizing. So lets see, leave it all to those who want us annihilated now that sounds logical to me. But then again I have never known a liberal who has ever considered logic. The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics.

So lets see, leave it all to those who want us annihilated now that sounds logical to me. But then again I have never known a liberal who has ever considered logic. The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics.

I read the article from your source and found a comment there that was appropriate: (Quote)As I peruse through these comments it appears to me that most of the liberals have no clue about reality and real survival. I would love to take a survey as to how many of them have actually served this country. I am not one for torture but then again I am not one for terrorizing. So lets see, leave it all to those who want us annihilated now that sounds logical to me. But then again I have never known a liberal who has ever considered logic. The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics. You can have your cities, your welfare your morals and whatever else you want and let's see who will survive? That I am afraid is what it is all going to be about in the future, our survival and be it as it may I know the first people who will come running to me when they are in need I will say to them you ignored the reality. ABC, CBS and CNN will bury themselves like the NYT and other papers have. You can't have it both ways people I want protection but I don't want anyone to get hurt. MoeKat1951(Quote) Nuff said.",

The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics. You can have your cities, your welfare your morals and whatever else you want and let's see who will survive? That I am afraid is what it is all going to be about in the future, our survival and be it as it may I know the first people who will come running to me when they are in need I will say to them you ignored the reality. ABC, CBS and CNN will bury themselves like the NYT and other papers have. You can't have it both ways people I want protection but I don't want anyone to get hurt. MoeKat1951(Quote) Nuff said.",

I would love to take a survey as to how many of them have actually served this country. I am not one for torture but then again I am not one for terrorizing. So lets see, leave it all to those who want us annihilated now that sounds logical to me. But then again I have never known a liberal who has ever considered logic. The fact is they will write or talk you to death so maybe we should turn these killers over to them and yep they probably will get answers because the terrorists will be so tortured with their rationale that they will beg them to stop talking the them to death. Like the present administration we see every day how it goes on and on and on and on. Look at me see what I'm doing. The point here is that if you think these people should be prosecuted fine but to tell the world about how we are trying to protect ourselves and to give away the names is just plain stupid. But then again the realities of war both in combat and in espionage is way above most of the people who write here anyway. They live in their beautiful houses and have many freedoms that were saved by finding out the answers in order to keep their freedoms. I saw a great saying the other day. Let's move all the conservatives to one area and the liberals to another. We will take our guns, our money, our jobs and our ethics. You can have your cities, your welfare your morals and whatever else you want and let's see who will survive? That I am afraid is what it is all going to be about in the future, our survival and be it as it may I know the first people who will come running to me when they are in need I will say to them you ignored the reality.
