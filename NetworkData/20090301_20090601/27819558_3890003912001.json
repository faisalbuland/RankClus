Defense Secretary Robert Gates says both he and President Barack Obama have \"a lot on our plates right now.\" As Gates puts it, \"let's push that one down the road a little bit.\" The White House has said Obama has begun consulting with Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on how to lift the ban. Gates says that dialogue has not really progressed very far at this point in the administration. Full article at > >http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hpeUgalkmDYBA01AqyemJ0xKtIQwD977NVQG0 That's OK Mr. Gates, we all realize the plate is rather full right now will more urgent and pressing matters. I don't think anyone in the gay community to be the in the top ten list of things to do within the first 100 days or so, but we do expect it to be done. Most everyone I talk to thinks that 2010 will be the earliest that any sigificent progress will be made. We have waited a long time and can wait a little longer and had rather it take a little time and be done right rather than rush and not have a proper or correct ending. So, Take your time, but the clock is ticking.",

Personally, I get a little angry everytime I hear that the Country has more important things on their plate. I'm sure the homo who's sitting on unemployment right now after a lengthy and honorable enlistment thinks there are more important things than paying their bills and keeping their bellies full. No hurry here. We'll just hope things get better before the unemployment runs out. Assuming the economy can handle it for that long.",
