In the midst if that conversation, the following was posted: Originally posted by boazjones: A LESS DYSFUNCTIONAL SOCIETY! A society where everyone has a sense of inclusion and participation - thereby mitigating the very root causes of a lot of the violence in this nation. The fact that you far-right-winged, paramilitary, Neo-Conservative Fascists are armed to the teeth doesn't solve anything. ------------------------------------------------ boazjones, FCSN - that's my name; beyond that you will have to have a need to know. That's the nicest way I can put it for you unethical group of Neo-Conservative Facist Hacks. Back to the point: This nation was founded on the principal of stealing from others and \"having the superior position assigned to the white race\" (Abraham Lincoln) All it ever took in this nation was a spirit of inclusion. A sense of humanity from you humanitarian posers talking about Earth Day; Obama is a Muslim Terrorist; and Rush Limbaugh is a \"demigod\". I just can't seem to to talk bad enough about you far-right-winged paramilitaries... ------------------------------------------------ I'm not a racist. I'm simply talking about the history of this nation that you don't want to face. I'm talking about the root cause of a great deal of violence in this nation. I'm speaking on the cause of what destroys families; robs people of opportunity, and removes any options of becoming a self-sufficient member of society. Everyone has guns. Kids have guns. Kids kill people daily. Just several weeks ago I was walking to the neighborhood store - when I could hear rocks riccochet of a fence near me. I turned to look, and there were three kids with attitudes. One of them had a gun and told me to \"keep steppin' \". Guns aren't the answer. Are they the solution? What? Should I arm myself at all times? Guns are necessary because of the avoidable evils of social and economic exclusion. And although you believe that a .50 caliber sub-machine gun is adequate home defense - exactly why do you feel the need to glorify it? The point is that we will always hear a violent and military solution from the Far-Right-Wing for everything. What we never seem to hear is anything constructive or anything that actually deals with solving the problems in this society. But as long as you have guns, I suppose you will never need to include anyone - will you? OK, is he right? what do you all think?",

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by. Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be. The day I have to carry a weapon to get through a day, that's when I need to find a better place to live. The Second Amendment assumed that America would not have a standing army. The framers of our Constitution were against the concept. So, the people would be called, when necessary, to do that which would be necessary to prevent America from falling under the control of a foreign power, or even perhaps from the tyranny of those from within. Now, with all the layers of law enforcement we have here - and the average American is subject to the control of at least four (municipal, county, state, and federal), one would hardly see a need for the average American to bear arms to protect himself. And those four layers are pretty well-regulated and populated by the average citizen, so one could assume further that those persons who bear arms as peacemakers would be all that is necessary, especially since all those persons, active and retired, usually have the right to bear arms on and off duty. But I'm not here to advocate taking anyone's guns from them. The Constitution gives that right, and I am not against it. My whole thing has to do with reasons, and nothing more. People can say that law enforcement is not there to protect, through active means or passive deterrent means. Fine. I'm not going to split hairs on that. My question, again, is why the environment you live in is such that you feel a need to be able to protect yourself with a firearm. Not your wits, not your hands or feet, a club, or a knife - but a gun. And guns are pretty much a thing that, once you let that little bullet fly, you can't take back, nor control. How 'bout it, guys? Forget the 2d Amendment and state law. Why is your environment so unsafe that you have to be strapped? We can do stuff \"just in case\" all the livelong day. It is said that the Vice President has a HAZMAT suit in the trunk of his car at all times, \"just in case\", but if nasty stuff is in the air, he ain't getting that suit without taking a whiff of what he thinks is going to kill him. So, again - why? No slogans, no quotes from someone else, no cutesy posters. Tell me, in your own words. I'm sure you don't do it because you want everyone to think you're a badass or something, so let's go in another direction here. Let's talk about how what we see, hear, or read makes us want to do so. ------------------ So, here we go again...",

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by. Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be. The day I have to carry a weapon to get through a day, that's when I need to find a better place to live. The Second Amendment assumed that America would not have a standing army. The framers of our Constitution were against the concept. So, the people would be called, when necessary, to do that which would be necessary to prevent America from falling under the control of a foreign power, or even perhaps from the tyranny of those from within. Now, with all the layers of law enforcement we have here - and the average American is subject to the control of at least four (municipal, county, state, and federal), one would hardly see a need for the average American to bear arms to protect himself. And those four layers are pretty well-regulated and populated by the average citizen, so one could assume further that those persons who bear arms as peacemakers would be all that is necessary, especially since all those persons, active and retired, usually have the right to bear arms on and off duty. But I'm not here to advocate taking anyone's guns from them. The Constitution gives that right, and I am not against it. My whole thing has to do with reasons, and nothing more. People can say that law enforcement is not there to protect, through active means or passive deterrent means. Fine. I'm not going to split hairs on that. My question, again, is why the environment you live in is such that you feel a need to be able to protect yourself with a firearm. Not your wits, not your hands or feet, a club, or a knife - but a gun. And guns are pretty much a thing that, once you let that little bullet fly, you can't take back, nor control. How 'bout it, guys? Forget the 2d Amendment and state law. Why is your environment so unsafe that you have to be strapped? We can do stuff \"just in case\" all the livelong day. It is said that the Vice President has a HAZMAT suit in the trunk of his car at all times, \"just in case\", but if nasty stuff is in the air, he ain't getting that suit without taking a whiff of what he thinks is going to kill him. So, again - why? No slogans, no quotes from someone else, no cutesy posters. Tell me, in your own words. I'm sure you don't do it because you want everyone to think you're a badass or something, so let's go in another direction here. Let's talk about how what we see, hear, or read makes us want to do so. ------------------ So, here we go again...",

My sons were also raised with rifles/shotguns tucked in the back of our closet. They were taught about them, their proper use, and the responsibility of caring for a weapon (nothing takes the romance and mystery out of something as having to take it apart and clean it). They also knew if they touched them without their dad or me present, they would get a paddling that would have them eating dinner standing up for a week. John2x said it almost exactly as my brothers and I were taught and how we taught our sons about guns. Never pick up a gun you don't intend to use. Never point a gun at someone unless you have already decided you are going to kill them. I have lived in the country nearly all my life, and when out checking fence on 160 acres go armed against poisonous snakes, 4 legged predators and 2 legged ones. Police protection is minimal due to distance. So yes, arming myself IS the answer. For those who aren't \"comfortable\" with guns, I say please don't buy/own one; rely on the local police for protection and I wish you well but the 2nd Amendment my family has fought for since this nation's birth guarantees my right to protect myself, my family and my property and I choose to exercise that right.",

Especially in a time when the Supreme Court STATED about the responsibility of police for the security of your family and loved ones is \"You, and only you, are responsible for your security and the security of your family and loved ones. That was the essence of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in the early 1980's when they ruled that the police do not have a duty to protect you as an individual, but to protect society as a whole.\" So through the courts the U.S. Government has stated that government does not have the responsibility to protect the citizens against crime. On June 27, in the case of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, the Supreme Court found that Jessica Gonzales did not have a constitutional right to individual police protection even in the presence of a restraining order. Mrs. Gonzales' husband with a track record of violence, stabbing Mrs. Gonzales to death, Mrs. Gonzales' family could not get the Supreme Court to change their unanimous decision for one's individual protection.

Especially in a time when the Supreme Court STATED about the responsibility of police for the security of your family and loved ones is \"You, and only you, are responsible for your security and the security of your family and loved ones. That was the essence of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in the early 1980's when they ruled that the police do not have a duty to protect you as an individual, but to protect society as a whole.\" So through the courts the U.S. Government has stated that government does not have the responsibility to protect the citizens against crime. On June 27, in the case of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, the Supreme Court found that Jessica Gonzales did not have a constitutional right to individual police protection even in the presence of a restraining order. Mrs. Gonzales' husband with a track record of violence, stabbing Mrs. Gonzales to death, Mrs. Gonzales' family could not get the Supreme Court to change their unanimous decision for one's individual protection.

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by. Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be. The day I have to carry a weapon to get through a day, that's when I need to find a better place to live. The Second Amendment assumed that America would not have a standing army. The framers of our Constitution were against the concept. So, the people would be called, when necessary, to do that which would be necessary to prevent America from falling under the control of a foreign power, or even perhaps from the tyranny of those from within. Now, with all the layers of law enforcement we have here - and the average American is subject to the control of at least four (municipal, county, state, and federal), one would hardly see a need for the average American to bear arms to protect himself. And those four layers are pretty well-regulated and populated by the average citizen, so one could assume further that those persons who bear arms as peacemakers would be all that is necessary, especially since all those persons, active and retired, usually have the right to bear arms on and off duty. But I'm not here to advocate taking anyone's guns from them. The Constitution gives that right, and I am not against it. My whole thing has to do with reasons, and nothing more. People can say that law enforcement is not there to protect, through active means or passive deterrent means. Fine. I'm not going to split hairs on that. My question, again, is why the environment you live in is such that you feel a need to be able to protect yourself with a firearm. Not your wits, not your hands or feet, a club, or a knife - but a gun. And guns are pretty much a thing that, once you let that little bullet fly, you can't take back, nor control. How 'bout it, guys? Forget the 2d Amendment and state law. Why is your environment so unsafe that you have to be strapped? We can do stuff \"just in case\" all the livelong day. It is said that the Vice President has a HAZMAT suit in the trunk of his car at all times, \"just in case\", but if nasty stuff is in the air, he ain't getting that suit without taking a whiff of what he thinks is going to kill him. So, again - why? No slogans, no quotes from someone else, no cutesy posters. Tell me, in your own words. I'm sure you don't do it because you want everyone to think you're a badass or something, so let's go in another direction here.

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by.", 
        "reply": " Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be.

I'm simply talking about the history of this nation that you don't want to face. I'm talking about the root cause of a great deal of violence in this nation. I'm speaking on the cause of what destroys families; robs people of opportunity, and removes any options of becoming a self-sufficient member of society. Everyone has guns. Kids have guns. Kids kill people daily. Just several weeks ago I was walking to the neighborhood store - when I could hear rocks riccochet of a fence near me. I turned to look, and there were three kids with attitudes. One of them had a gun and told me to \"keep steppin' \". Guns aren't the answer. Are they the solution? What? Should I arm myself at all times? Guns are necessary because of the avoidable evils of social and economic exclusion. And although you believe that a .50 caliber sub-machine gun is adequate home defense - exactly why do you feel the need to glorify it? The point is that we will always hear a violent and military solution from the Far-Right-Wing for everything. What we never seem to hear is anything constructive or anything that actually deals with solving the problems in this society. But as long as you have guns, I suppose you will never need to include anyone - will you? OK, is he right? what do you all think?",

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by. Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be. The day I have to carry a weapon to get through a day, that's when I need to find a better place to live. The Second Amendment assumed that America would not have a standing army. The framers of our Constitution were against the concept. So, the people would be called, when necessary, to do that which would be necessary to prevent America from falling under the control of a foreign power, or even perhaps from the tyranny of those from within. Now, with all the layers of law enforcement we have here - and the average American is subject to the control of at least four (municipal, county, state, and federal), one would hardly see a need for the average American to bear arms to protect himself. And those four layers are pretty well-regulated and populated by the average citizen, so one could assume further that those persons who bear arms as peacemakers would be all that is necessary, especially since all those persons, active and retired, usually have the right to bear arms on and off duty. But I'm not here to advocate taking anyone's guns from them. The Constitution gives that right, and I am not against it. My whole thing has to do with reasons, and nothing more. People can say that law enforcement is not there to protect, through active means or passive deterrent means. Fine. I'm not going to split hairs on that. My question, again, is why the environment you live in is such that you feel a need to be able to protect yourself with a firearm. Not your wits, not your hands or feet, a club, or a knife - but a gun. And guns are pretty much a thing that, once you let that little bullet fly, you can't take back, nor control. How 'bout it, guys? Forget the 2d Amendment and state law. Why is your environment so unsafe that you have to be strapped? We can do stuff \"just in case\" all the livelong day. It is said that the Vice President has a HAZMAT suit in the trunk of his car at all times, \"just in case\", but if nasty stuff is in the air, he ain't getting that suit without taking a whiff of what he thinks is going to kill him. So, again - why? No slogans, no quotes from someone else, no cutesy posters. Tell me, in your own words. I'm sure you don't do it because you want everyone to think you're a badass or something, so let's go in another direction here. Let's talk about how what we see, hear, or read makes us want to do so. ------------------ So, here we go again...",

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by. Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be. The day I have to carry a weapon to get through a day, that's when I need to find a better place to live. The Second Amendment assumed that America would not have a standing army. The framers of our Constitution were against the concept. So, the people would be called, when necessary, to do that which would be necessary to prevent America from falling under the control of a foreign power, or even perhaps from the tyranny of those from within. Now, with all the layers of law enforcement we have here - and the average American is subject to the control of at least four (municipal, county, state, and federal), one would hardly see a need for the average American to bear arms to protect himself. And those four layers are pretty well-regulated and populated by the average citizen, so one could assume further that those persons who bear arms as peacemakers would be all that is necessary, especially since all those persons, active and retired, usually have the right to bear arms on and off duty. But I'm not here to advocate taking anyone's guns from them. The Constitution gives that right, and I am not against it. My whole thing has to do with reasons, and nothing more. People can say that law enforcement is not there to protect, through active means or passive deterrent means. Fine. I'm not going to split hairs on that. My question, again, is why the environment you live in is such that you feel a need to be able to protect yourself with a firearm. Not your wits, not your hands or feet, a club, or a knife - but a gun. And guns are pretty much a thing that, once you let that little bullet fly, you can't take back, nor control. How 'bout it, guys? Forget the 2d Amendment and state law. Why is your environment so unsafe that you have to be strapped? We can do stuff \"just in case\" all the livelong day. It is said that the Vice President has a HAZMAT suit in the trunk of his car at all times, \"just in case\", but if nasty stuff is in the air, he ain't getting that suit without taking a whiff of what he thinks is going to kill him. So, again - why? No slogans, no quotes from someone else, no cutesy posters. Tell me, in your own words. I'm sure you don't do it because you want everyone to think you're a badass or something, so let's go in another direction here. Let's talk about how what we see, hear, or read makes us want to do so. ------------------ So, here we go again...",

We were taught at an early age to respect the weapons for what they were, a means of protection, supplying food and for sport (trap) shooting. My sons were also raised with rifles/shotguns tucked in the back of our closet. They were taught about them, their proper use, and the responsibility of caring for a weapon (nothing takes the romance and mystery out of something as having to take it apart and clean it). They also knew if they touched them without their dad or me present, they would get a paddling that would have them eating dinner standing up for a week. John2x said it almost exactly as my brothers and I were taught and how we taught our sons about guns. Never pick up a gun you don't intend to use. Never point a gun at someone unless you have already decided you are going to kill them. I have lived in the country nearly all my life, and when out checking fence on 160 acres go armed against poisonous snakes, 4 legged predators and 2 legged ones. Police protection is minimal due to distance. So yes, arming myself IS the answer. For those who aren't \"comfortable\" with guns, I say please don't buy/own one; rely on the local police for protection and I wish you well but the 2nd Amendment my family has fought for since this nation's birth guarantees my right to protect myself, my family and my property and I choose to exercise that right.",

That was the essence of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in the early 1980's when they ruled that the police do not have a duty to protect you as an individual, but to protect society as a whole.\" So through the courts the U.S. Government has stated that government does not have the responsibility to protect the citizens against crime. On June 27, in the case of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, the Supreme Court found that Jessica Gonzales did not have a constitutional right to individual police protection even in the presence of a restraining order. Mrs. Gonzales' husband with a track record of violence, stabbing Mrs. Gonzales to death, Mrs. Gonzales' family could not get the Supreme Court to change their unanimous decision for one's individual protection.

        "reply": "Had I not armed myself, neither my family nor myself would be here today, So yes it is the answer. Especially in a time when the Supreme Court STATED about the responsibility of police for the security of your family and loved ones is \"You, and only you, are responsible for your security and the security of your family and loved ones. That was the essence of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in the early 1980's when they ruled that the police do not have a duty to protect you as an individual, but to protect society as a whole.\" So through the courts the U.S. Government has stated that government does not have the responsibility to protect the citizens against crime. On June 27, in the case of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, the Supreme Court found that Jessica Gonzales did not have a constitutional right to individual police protection even in the presence of a restraining order. Mrs. Gonzales' husband with a track record of violence, stabbing Mrs. Gonzales to death, Mrs. Gonzales' family could not get the Supreme Court to change their unanimous decision for one's individual protection.

DeVito, 686 F.2d 616 (7th Cir. 1982). (4) DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189 (1989). (5) Ford v. Town of Grafton, 693 N.E.2d 1047 (Mass. App. 1998). (6) Warren v. District of Columbia, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. 1981). \"...a government and its agencies are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any particular individual citizen...\" -Warren v. District of Columbia, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. App. 1981) (7) \"What makes the City's position particularly difficult to understand is that, in conformity to the dictates of the law, Linda did not carry any weapon for self-defense. Thus by a rather bitter irony she was required to rely for protection on the City of NY which now denies all responsibility to her.\" Riss v. New York, 22 N.Y.2d 579,293 N.Y.S.2d 897, 240 N.E.2d 806 (1958). (8) \"Law enforcement agencies and personnel have no duty to protect individuals from the criminal acts of others; instead their duty is to preserve the peace and arrest law breakers for the protection of the general public.\" Lynch v.

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by. Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be. The day I have to carry a weapon to get through a day, that's when I need to find a better place to live. The Second Amendment assumed that America would not have a standing army. The framers of our Constitution were against the concept. So, the people would be called, when necessary, to do that which would be necessary to prevent America from falling under the control of a foreign power, or even perhaps from the tyranny of those from within. Now, with all the layers of law enforcement we have here - and the average American is subject to the control of at least four (municipal, county, state, and federal), one would hardly see a need for the average American to bear arms to protect himself. And those four layers are pretty well-regulated and populated by the average citizen, so one could assume further that those persons who bear arms as peacemakers would be all that is necessary, especially since all those persons, active and retired, usually have the right to bear arms on and off duty. But I'm not here to advocate taking anyone's guns from them. The Constitution gives that right, and I am not against it. My whole thing has to do with reasons, and nothing more. People can say that law enforcement is not there to protect, through active means or passive deterrent means. Fine. I'm not going to split hairs on that. My question, again, is why the environment you live in is such that you feel a need to be able to protect yourself with a firearm. Not your wits, not your hands or feet, a club, or a knife - but a gun. And guns are pretty much a thing that, once you let that little bullet fly, you can't take back, nor control. How 'bout it, guys? Forget the 2d Amendment and state law. Why is your environment so unsafe that you have to be strapped? We can do stuff \"just in case\" all the livelong day. It is said that the Vice President has a HAZMAT suit in the trunk of his car at all times, \"just in case\", but if nasty stuff is in the air, he ain't getting that suit without taking a whiff of what he thinks is going to kill him. So, again - why? No slogans, no quotes from someone else, no cutesy posters. Tell me, in your own words. I'm sure you don't do it because you want everyone to think you're a badass or something, so let's go in another direction here. Let's talk about how what we see, hear, or read makes us want to do so. ------------------ So, here we go again...",

Those we're the exact same words my father spoke when he gave me my first shooting lesson, those words I never forgot. Words that every gun owner not only should know, but also live by.", 
        "reply": " Well, that's basic knowledge. But how does that relate to the necessity of arming oneself? I believe that the Gun Golden Rule applies to one who's already strapped. The central question here is this: Why do you need it in the first place? I started a similar thread in June 2008, and all I got was a bunch of people got highly defensive and even indignant over even daring to ask such a question. In ten pages of posts, I only got a couple of intelligent answers. Here was my original statement: ------------------ For me, I don't see a need to do so. I'm perfectly aware of all the violence in the United States; after all, I was born and raised in a city far more crowded and violent than most of you have, I'm sure (south side of Chicago, with gangs on the periphery of my neighborhood in three directions). I was once shot at from behind, and also was robbed once at gunpoint. I've survived on this planet for 50 years, only owning a rifle for a brief period of time when I was a hunter. I'm perfectly aware, as a person who has been the victim of racial-related hostility in the Midwest, of man's inhumanity to man. I can also read about it every single day. So I have no illusions about life on this planet. But I'm still here, and the odds of my demise from a gun-toter, though they have increased exponentially since my return to the States, are still very, very small. If someone wants to lay their hands on me or try to stab me, they may come out of that ordeal thinking that it wasn't a very good idea (the knife carrier may have slightly better odds). So I'm not afraid to defend myself and have always been perfectly capable of doing so. You see, in my personal experience, I see absolutely no reason to pack a pistol as an accessory when I leave my home. There are certainly thousands of them around me at any given time; I currently live in a concealed carry state. Now, I have no idea who has one and who doesn't, and frankly, I don't really care. But I also know that otherwise law-abiding citizens have a bad day, walk into a crowded restaurant, and shoot up the place. It happens every day. Fortunately for me, that sort of thing happens in the types of places I don't frequent anyway, so I don't worry much about that. I just don't see myself under that kind of threat. Call me what you want, I don't really care. I'm still here, and have no choice as to what my manner of passing will be. The day I have to carry a weapon to get through a day, that's when I need to find a better place to live. The Second Amendment assumed that America would not have a standing army.
