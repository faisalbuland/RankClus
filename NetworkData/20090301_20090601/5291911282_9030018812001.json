Nothing was working in our efforts to catch him. then one day we three of us hide behind our wall lockers and in walks a guy from the platoon across the hall. We caught him red handed with one of the guy's camera. We took him down stairs to the CO offices. LT \u2018ski took one look at the guy and said \u201cthis guy is not a barracks\u2019 thief. I\u2019ve been in the army all of my life and I know a barracks thief when I see one.\u201d (LT \u2018ski\u2019s father was a retired CWO. The LT had been a first sergeant in Korea and received a battle field commission.) He said get out of my office and when you come back with the right guy I will know by looking at him, if he\u2019s a barrack\u2019s thief or not. Now you have only 15 minutes to show me a barrack\u2019s thief. So we took the guy back up two flights of stairs to our platoon area. The guy was kind of klutzes. Going up the stairs he kept falling and in the platoon area he slipped a couple of times and hit the floor really hard. And then taking him back down the stairs he fell a couple more times. We met LT \u2018ski as he was coming out of his office. He took one look at the guy and said \u2013 I can tell this guy is our barracks thief. How, what were we saying about finding a troll, forget? This was our motley crew in the field and in the barracks: God and the soldier, All men adore, In time of trouble, And no more; For when war is over, And all things righted, God is neglected - The old soldier slighted.
