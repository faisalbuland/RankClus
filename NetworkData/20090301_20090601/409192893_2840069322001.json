Even the most ardent union supporters will admit the whole point of the union is to take as much capital as possible out of the company before it goes under.

Companies have shown a renewed view that workers are \"throwaway commodities\" that can be tossed aside when convenient - all in the name of corporate greed. To give you an example (and a personal one at that), the company I work for announced a few weeks ago that employees below the senior plant management level (E09 paygrade, 4 individuals at our facility at or above that paygrade) were going to be forced to take a 5% pay cut. This pay cut did not apply to those above that paygrade. These same workers were given two more bombshells - that our health insurance premiums would rise 60% (mine went from $85/mo to $135/mo) even though our HMO's (BlueCross/BlueShield) rates had only increased by 6% over last year. The second bombshell was that we would not get a cost of living increase - while at the E09 paygrade and above, it actually increased - from 6% to 9%. Since then it's been announced that in the time frame from May 2009 through September 2009 all hourly employees would be required to take 11 scheduled work days off - and we could not use our PTO/vacation time to cover the loss of pay incurred by this. These same managers are the one's whose knee-jerk reaction to the market slashed our workforce and equipment reserves down to the point that we can't even make our shipments (which have gone down significantly) on time - we went from being able to deliver 98% of our production on time down to 68% - which means increased cost because we have to ship the material by next day air rather than ship by truck - and it costs us $4,000 more per pallet to ship via air than truck. That adds up quite quickly when you consider that we currently ship over 250 pallets of material per week - of which 75 or more will require shipping by air to get there on time - that's $300,000 per week because of a lousy management decision! Another example of their bad decisions is this: Among the personnel cuts were 11 failure analysis/repair technicians (electronics technicians responsible for determining the cause of failure on items that don't pass testing and implementing corrective actions) - a move that saved about $385,000 per year - yet in a period of only 3 months the value of items awaiting analysis/repair has gone from $165,000 in February of this year to $4,200,000 as of a couple weeks ago! IMHO, a resurgence in union numbers and membership is needed in the American workplace to stop this trend. Workers are being forced to make sacrifice after sacrifice, pay cuts and benefit reductions while management and executives continue to make outlandish salaries that only increase every year.

Companies have shown a renewed view that workers are \"throwaway commodities\" that can be tossed aside when convenient - all in the name of corporate greed. To give you an example (and a personal one at that), the company I work for announced a few weeks ago that employees below the senior plant management level (E09 paygrade, 4 individuals at our facility at or above that paygrade) were going to be forced to take a 5% pay cut. This pay cut did not apply to those above that paygrade. These same workers were given two more bombshells - that our health insurance premiums would rise 60% (mine went from $85/mo to $135/mo) even though our HMO's (BlueCross/BlueShield) rates had only increased by 6% over last year. The second bombshell was that we would not get a cost of living increase - while at the E09 paygrade and above, it actually increased - from 6% to 9%. Since then it's been announced that in the time frame from May 2009 through September 2009 all hourly employees would be required to take 11 scheduled work days off - and we could not use our PTO/vacation time to cover the loss of pay incurred by this. These same managers are the one's whose knee-jerk reaction to the market slashed our workforce and equipment reserves down to the point that we can't even make our shipments (which have gone down significantly) on time - we went from being able to deliver 98% of our production on time down to 68% - which means increased cost because we have to ship the material by next day air rather than ship by truck - and it costs us $4,000 more per pallet to ship via air than truck. That adds up quite quickly when you consider that we currently ship over 250 pallets of material per week - of which 75 or more will require shipping by air to get there on time - that's $300,000 per week because of a lousy management decision! Another example of their bad decisions is this: Among the personnel cuts were 11 failure analysis/repair technicians (electronics technicians responsible for determining the cause of failure on items that don't pass testing and implementing corrective actions) - a move that saved about $385,000 per year - yet in a period of only 3 months the value of items awaiting analysis/repair has gone from $165,000 in February of this year to $4,200,000 as of a couple weeks ago! IMHO, a resurgence in union numbers and membership is needed in the American workplace to stop this trend. Workers are being forced to make sacrifice after sacrifice, pay cuts and benefit reductions while management and executives continue to make outlandish salaries that only increase every year.

Companies have shown a renewed view that workers are \"throwaway commodities\" that can be tossed aside when convenient - all in the name of corporate greed. To give you an example (and a personal one at that), the company I work for announced a few weeks ago that employees below the senior plant management level (E09 paygrade, 4 individuals at our facility at or above that paygrade) were going to be forced to take a 5% pay cut. This pay cut did not apply to those above that paygrade. These same workers were given two more bombshells - that our health insurance premiums would rise 60% (mine went from $85/mo to $135/mo) even though our HMO's (BlueCross/BlueShield) rates had only increased by 6% over last year. The second bombshell was that we would not get a cost of living increase - while at the E09 paygrade and above, it actually increased - from 6% to 9%. Since then it's been announced that in the time frame from May 2009 through September 2009 all hourly employees would be required to take 11 scheduled work days off - and we could not use our PTO/vacation time to cover the loss of pay incurred by this. These same managers are the one's whose knee-jerk reaction to the market slashed our workforce and equipment reserves down to the point that we can't even make our shipments (which have gone down significantly) on time - we went from being able to deliver 98% of our production on time down to 68% - which means increased cost because we have to ship the material by next day air rather than ship by truck - and it costs us $4,000 more per pallet to ship via air than truck. That adds up quite quickly when you consider that we currently ship over 250 pallets of material per week - of which 75 or more will require shipping by air to get there on time - that's $300,000 per week because of a lousy management decision! Another example of their bad decisions is this: Among the personnel cuts were 11 failure analysis/repair technicians (electronics technicians responsible for determining the cause of failure on items that don't pass testing and implementing corrective actions) - a move that saved about $385,000 per year - yet in a period of only 3 months the value of items awaiting analysis/repair has gone from $165,000 in February of this year to $4,200,000 as of a couple weeks ago! IMHO, a resurgence in union numbers and membership is needed in the American workplace to stop this trend. Workers are being forced to make sacrifice after sacrifice, pay cuts and benefit reductions while management and executives continue to make outlandish salaries that only increase every year.

I believed in them untill I seen how they would protect a complete Idiot from losing his job,A job he was not qualified to do but the union made sure he wasn't terminated. I seen the Teamsters union protect a driver who had four chargable accidents in one year. He was lost in a city. He took a set of joints into a trailer park and attempted to drive between two trailers. The Incident cost the truck line in excess of $100,000.00 in repairs and replacement. The driver was suspended for seven day's WITH benefits, and drew vacation pay. So to the person who said. You can always tell the differance between a union worker and a union worker. NUFF SAID IF THE ENEMY IS IN RANGE , SO ARE YOU. I.Y.A.O.Y.A.S.",

Cheap off-the-rack clothing from Wal-mart, cheap Vietnamese suits and shirts from Kohl's and Penney's, cheap Chinese steel and pet food--all available because the workers who manufacture them happily live a third world life. Labor Unions are collective bargaining organizations. Management hates them because their memberships are more difficult to divide and conquer. How many GM production employees would ever have been allowed within 1,000 feet of Rick Waggoner or his type? How would GM manage the logistics of allowing each of their several hundred thousand employees open-door access to upper management? Simple answer to both: To the first: None but a few designated representatives (let's just call them shop stewards). To the second: Let the employees pick a few designated representatives (let's just call them shop stewards) to carry concerns, grievances, and suggestions to the top. GM pays bonuses to production employees who offer written suggestions which improve product or process--the bonuses are calculated from the savings they create. Membership in the manufacturing sector is contracting, but I'd say that's primarily because the manufacturing sector in the US is contracting--Cheap off-the-rack clothing from Wal-mart, cheap Vietnamese suits and shirts from Kohl's and Penney's, cheap Chinese steel and pet food--all available because the workers who manufacture them happily live a third world life.
