His frequent statements to the press usually stressed the need for \"more troops\" and were generally pessimistic. He may be a fine general and quite possibly an excellent leader but he certainly did not inspire confidence. No doubt the Taliban liked what he was saying. Had this government taken action earlier in the Iraq War, replacing L/Gen. Sanchez with General Patreaus (or a flag rank officer of similar qualities, as Gen. Patreaus was almost an unknown at that stage in the Iraq War), quite possibly that war would have been far less costly and involved. The same applies to Gen. Casey as he was retained in command, even when it was obvious that the war was well beyond him and his capabilities. It is time for a change in Afghanistan, probably long overdue. Jack",
