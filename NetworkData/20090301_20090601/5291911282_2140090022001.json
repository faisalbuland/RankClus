What are the options (in general terms, no need to be that specific)? If you want combat operations, you probably know the basics of Infantry, Armor or Artillery. Platoon leaders are Lieutenants, Battalion staff officers are higher ranking lieutenants and captains. Company/Battery commanders are senior captains and the top two Battalion officers (XO and S-3) are likely Majors. Adding in the schools you will attend, that's the first fifteen years of your career. It's pretty much the same in Infantry or Armor, only with different schools.

What are the options (in general terms, no need to be that specific)? If you want combat operations, you probably know the basics of Infantry, Armor or Artillery. Platoon leaders are Lieutenants, Battalion staff officers are higher ranking lieutenants and captains. Company/Battery commanders are senior captains and the top two Battalion officers (XO and S-3) are likely Majors. Adding in the schools you will attend, that's the first fifteen years of your career. It's pretty much the same in Infantry or Armor, only with different schools. Combat Support and Service Support are slightly different, with more positions in Brigade/Division/Corps staff after making Captain. Sullivan013",
