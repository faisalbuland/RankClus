I changed the address to a current address and then forgot about it. This morning I got into that e-mail and discovered some unread e-mails from MDC members. They had been there unread for some time. I opened them and replied to those who wrote to me and probably thought I was ignoring them. Sometimes it pays to go into your account settings for your profile and check the settings to make sure your getting the messages being sent to you. If you sent an e-mail to that old address then, well... it's in the ether section of the internet and I doubt I'll ever see it. Sorry to anyone who may have felt slighted by my lack of attention to the details in my account section. Now, while your thinking about it, go into your profile and check your settings and update the stuff that might make a difference.
