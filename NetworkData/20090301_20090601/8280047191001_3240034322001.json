MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags.

If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

MEMORIAL DAY REMEMBRANCE Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend Memorial Day observances at more than 100 VA national cemeteries between 23 & 30 MAY 09. These commemorative events held over Memorial Day weekend or on the traditional Memorial Day (May 30) will honor the nearly one million American men and women who have died wearing the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Forces. Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

Special activities include color guards, bands, choirs, moving oratory, historic displays, the display of the \u201cAvenue of Flags\u201d or the placement of individual gravesite flags. Most events are sponsored by community, patriotic and civic groups in cooperation with national cemetery staff. For a listing of these ceremonies refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems/2009MemDay.asp. This listing is in alphabetic order by state. Select the name of the state in which the cemetery is located. Note that there is not a VA national cemetery in every state. For a listing of the locations of national cemeteries refer to www.cem.va.gov/cems_nmc.asp. If in doubt as to where a loved one or family member is buried you might be able to locate him/her on the nationwide grave locator index http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/j2ee/servlet/NGL_v1. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.

Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on 5 May 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and the US Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, National Cemetery. The first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873. By 1890 it was recognized by all of the northern states. The South continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I (when the holiday changed from honoring just those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in any war). It is now celebrated in almost every State on the last Monday in May (passed by Congress with the National Holiday Act, P.L. 90 - 363, in 1971 to ensure a three day weekend for Federal holidays). However, southern states have an additional separate day for honoring the Confederate war dead: 19 January in Texas, 26 April in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi; 10 May in South Carolina; and 3 June (Jefferson Davis' birthday) in Louisiana and Tennessee. Since the late 50's on the Thursday before Memorial Day, soldiers of the 3d U.S. Infantry place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery. They then patrol 24 hours a day during the weekend to ensure that each flag remains standing. Since 1998, on the Saturday before the observed day for Memorial Day, the Boys Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each of approximately 15,300 gravesites of soldiers buried in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights. To help Americans re-educate and remind Americans of the true meaning of Memorial Day, the \"National Moment of Remembrance\" resolution was passed on Dec 2000 which asks that at 3 p.m. local time, for all Americans \"To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a Moment of remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to 'Taps.\" [Source: www.cem.va.gov May 09 ++] I will cast no stones.
