They're raising transit benefits for Feds who work in the District. I'm sure its not just DOT. Probably all agencies in the District are participating. What are transit benefits? They are subsidies that Federal employees working in DC receive in order to offset the cost of transportation. How much are they? Well, when I started here 10 years ago they were $90 per month. They are currently $120 per month. What are they going to? According to the email, transit benefits will increase to $230 per month. Guess that means metro, AMTRAK, and all the bus services will raise their prices accordingly. That s u c k s for the non-Fed who doesn't get benefits and still has to come to work in the District. Sure am glad to hear that DOT is doing their part. Wonder how much it will add to the deficit? I'll have to reflect on that over Starbucks while I wait for my ride home.",
