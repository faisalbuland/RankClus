Subject: Tombstone Don't get much clearer than that...huh??? TOMBSTONE Professor Joseph Olson of Hemline University School of Law, St. Paul, Minnesota, points out some interesting facts concerning the Presidential election: Number of States won by: Democrats: 19 Republicans: 29 Square miles of land won by: Democrats: 580,000 Republicans: 2,427,000 Population of counties won by: Democrats: 127 million Republicans: 143 million Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by: Democrats: 13.2 Republicans: 2..1 Professor Olson adds: \"In aggregate, the map of the territory Republican won was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of the country. Democrat territory mostly encompassed those citizens living in government-owned tenements and living off various forms of government welfare...\" Olson believes the United States is now somewhere between the \"complacency and apathy\" phase of Professor Tyler's definition of democracy, with some forty percent of the nation's population already having reached the \"governmental dependency\" phase. If Congress grants amnesty and citizenship to twenty-million criminal invaders called illegal's and they vote, then we can say good-bye to the USA in fewer than five years. If you are in favor of this, then by all means, delete this message. If you are not, then pass this along to help everyone realize just how much is at stake, knowing that apathy is the greatest danger to our freedom. SEABEE'S \"CAN DO\", \"HAVE DONE\", AND WILL DO SO FOREVER. GOD BLESS AMERICA",

However in my opinion it is as true as if it was writen yesterday. It won't be long and there will be some very big heart rendering changes made that even those that voted Democrat will cry. To start with on the news a couple nites ago I heard one of the Supreme Court Justices is going to retire. That will give BHO the oportunity to sway the balance of the supreme in his favor and we will see many amendments to the constitution changed.
