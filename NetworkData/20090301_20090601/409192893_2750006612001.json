When President Bush was President there were moderators everywhere looking for even the remote chance someone may be \"disrespectful\" to POTUS. Now that President Obama is in office it seems that there is a wild free for all in terms of questioning him, calling him names, questioning his citizenship etc. etc. Has something changed? Are we now allowed to do this? I had friends \"kicked off\" this board for questioning Bush's authority or decisions. Certainly what I am reading here would have caused the writers to be banned for life if they had said this stuff about President Bush. Seems like things have changed a bit.",

If what I'm hearing that financial interests caused a relaxing of a standard, that seems odd to me. To me, that implies that the major contributors to this site, a site that is catered to the military, that knows to show respect to the Commander in Chief, don't hold those same values. Not to tick anyone off here, or put anyone on the spot - but that doesn't make sense to me. Why should who the Commander in Chief is make any difference?",

Bottomline is this... The OFFICE of POTUS is to be respected. You may not agree with the policies of the individual in the Office and state such. But, you are not allowed to openly run rabid on the 'chair sitter'...and openly be disruptive and disrespectful. \"Think before you post\". What caused me to ask this question are the posts currently on line about President Obama. Have you read the posts concerning President Obama? What defines \"openly rabid\"? The stuff I am reading here far exceeds anything I read about President Bush. Yes, I was here and I left on my own because every time you even remotely discussed something against President Bush you were seen as a \"disrupter\" or \"disrespectful\". I thought I would come back to see how the forums are now and I have not been shocked. I figured this would occur. Which, by the way, I am OK with. I am fine with having open dialogue about the POTUS and his policies. In fact, it is respectful in my mind to question authority; the Country was built on this and, in fact, our forefathers took up arms against what was \"the authority\". I personally think President Obama is the best thing to happen to this Country in my lifetime. Unfortunately, he was left a Country which is essentially in tatters. But, I could not think of anyone to fix the mess better than President Obama. I fully support the new policy and look forward to lively debate. With all due respect, MC, I don't see it that way. I have seen it both ways. Yes, there are some here that will \"disrespect\" our current CinC but, there are some here who have disrespected our former CinC. It equals out. For those who do not take their rose-tinted glasses off will not see it as equal...they only see it one sided, which you are purporting as of this conversation, you know what I mean?
