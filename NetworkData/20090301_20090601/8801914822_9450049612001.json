I am from Shanghai Thanks for reading The Difference between Chinese race and foreigners The rudimentary difference between Chinese race and foreigners largely lies in the destitution of nature wildness and bestiality . Chinese people lacks unbridled nature wildness which is a common thing which existed in the psyche of Japanese , Nordic race or Slavic race . For those foreigners , there is an rebellious and untrammeled aura within their innate psyche , but as for this unimpeachable common human nature , oddly is in serious destitution among Chinese people . Chinese is an race of being utterly tamed , being tamed which indicated his wild and rebellious nature are being surgically removed , whats only left is the docility and unreasonable obedience towards his authority whom he being destined assign to. Chinese is domesticated animal in comparence with Nordic people or Japanese as wild animal . Oddly enough the Chinese often proudly eulogize of this unwonted phenomenon as if it is a gift from high above , and commenting that the Chinese as the veritable human-being compare to the foreigners , the human yet not reach his completion . From this doleful euphemism I found it is only a mean of face saving . Man as a specie of mammal , is not immune from animal instincts , urges of being mating , being feed upon, enjoy unbridled freedom of choice in a manifestation of vengeful retribution and brave self-immolation , that are all types of normal bestiality and nature wildness what makes a human. Humanity itself are not immune from these qualities , reasonable bestiality and rebellious wildness is essential of making a healthy human-being , also that those quality is what makes a man complete . The wild and rebellious quality is befitting the notion of true and healthy humanity , on the contrary it is abnormality when those essential spiritual component being surpassed , deprived or castrated. It is a twisted of humanity when someone being corned or enforced into tamed and docile circumstances . Wild animal is meant for freedom , conquering hardship , struggle for survival , the domesticated creature are destined to be restrained , repressed ,enslaved or slaughtered as his masters wishes . , eunuch , as his genital being cut off , thus he lost his most precious component of being a complete man , thus many of them are suffered from some kind of perversity , as a man , his soul or spirit being castrated , he is destined for mental distortion , as matter of fact, , in the early days of ancient Chinese , they had also endowed with everything that is same from other people in four corner of universe, they have been endowed with spiritual perceptivity , rebellious wildness and nature bestiality , they are as being as humane , brave or intelligent as any one , but such wild race was threatening the rule of the ruler , thus the ancient ruler of China had create a culture that destroying humanity and turning people from free living life form into pets. Such domestication is called confusciosm , it aims to deprive people \u2018s manhood and turning them into benumbed spiritual eunuchs . As the component of spiritual humanity being maimed , Chinese had lost previous spiritual perceptivity from their soul , and precipitated into a state of spiritual eunuchs, Spiritual eunuchs are close to physiological eunuchs , both of them are suffer from perversity .

        "content": "There is a distinctive earmark regarding the Chinese martial arts novel . That is the miracle is always accompany our hero , there is elusive luck around him all the time . Our hero\u2019s strength sometime will increase ten fold by accidentally swallowed the mysterious herb , sometime transferred by some legendary hermit . The result is that our hero\u2019s power is increased in a very elusive way and easily overweight the bad guys , in the end of the story , our hero constantly defeat villains in a easy blow , and elusively attract the admiration of the crowd , win the girls and become the leader of martial arts world , This is the clique of Chinese martial art novels , Around our hero, there is an unfathomable luck and miracle keep happening . From the developing of the plot , there is no suspense but ascertained clique , hero always developed into magical luck , without hardship he acquired some unmatched martial arts power , and vanquished all the villain with great ease , in the end everybody is jubilant . This is the earmark of Chinese martial arts novels . On the other hand , about the marital arts novel of Japanese , the hero from the Japanese book does not rely too much around miracles , but instead of depict how lucky the hero is , the Japanese are more inclined to depict the training of the hero , how to conquer one\u2019s fear , the fearful nature of common nature of man , fear of death , after the hardship the hero develops the valor of conquer the fear inspired psyche , in the end of story of course our hero wins , but here what really lies is not the result but the process , it is not really the enemy who you against , but yourself , how to conquer yourself of petty consternation or that . And in the meantime , The Japanese depiction of combat is more realistic than the Chinese , there is no miracle , no elusive luck in the fight . The verdict of the battle mainly lies the psychological or state of the mind of the two , surely there is the difference between skill or power , but it never reached the level of Chinese who try to deify the magic of martial arts . In Chinese story there is no suspense , nothing variable , everything is predictable . Hero vanquished the bad guy with great ease . Japanese are more interest in the process not the result , but Chinese are inclined to emphasis that the hero is always lucky . More importantly , The cultivation of hero\u2019s martial arts , it does not demand hardship but rather rely on some elusive luck , there are always some mysterious hermit lurking in the background waiting to wave his magic wand of giving our hero his unmatched martial arts power . The result is our hero became invincible , somehow there are always miracles around our hero . In the novel of Japanese , the hero also become strong , and yet this has nothing to do with any sort of miracles , the hero is mere mortal just as anybody else , in facing hardship , the hero is also being strike by its intensity , there is also fear harboring in his breast , but rely on his volition and will , he conquered his own imperfection and flaw , there is no miracle , no hermit who cast a spell that gave him power , nevertheless the hero always rely his own struggle , in the end the hero has defeated his sworn foe who is stronger than him . This is the difference between Chinese and Japanese martial arts novel . Sometime people suggest that , from the literature , one can make discernment upon the soul of a people , for myself I do not know great deal about literature , but from my favorite martial arts novels , I have discerned certain truth . The way I see it is that , Chinese style martial art novel is not realistic , at least not as real as the Japanese count part . Chinese rely on way too many miracles , there is miracle helping the hero develop his unmatched skill , miracles also happened in his duel with his sworn foe . For the Japanese , there are no miracles , the Japanese hero , for his duel with the villain of the end ,his skill may not surpass his foe . His skill is result of tasteless and boring , repeated hardship of training , for vengeful retribution , he had endure all that with his volition , he surpassed his inward fearful nature . In the end , he had succeed , but there is no elusive luck , neverthess , the hero had endured danger and hardship . From this , I had fathomed two facts , first , the Chinese way of viewing the world is childish , good guys always beats the bad guys , good guy wins , bad guys die . There is always some miracle helping the good guys win , hero defeats the villain come out without a scratch on him . The Japanese view the duel is fair , there is no such thing as good guy beats bad guy , the psyche , the training of the past , the courage , skill is the determining factor of the result of the fight . There will be no miracle , any level of fear or hesitation in the duel could result death . Duel is fair , strong vessel defeats weaklings , the strong is more than just the martial arts skill , also include psychological facts. In this , I believe the Japanese is more mature than Chinese , their way of viewing the world is more realistic , Chinese is way to subjective and childish , indulging in the dream of miracles of the hero is childish . In the real world , there is no such thing as miracles , you reap what you sow . Chinese inclination of indulging in a fanciful dream of miracles is self-deception . In the meantime , The Chinese style of miracles , it also a product of bad ethics , as bad as does not believe in making efforts or paying price for any success . In the novel Chinese hero\u2019s success in martial arts does not dwell too much on hardship and danger , nevertheless is more appears to be there is fairy always cast magic on the hero with single swing of his wand . Chinese novel does not enjoy depict the hardship of making efforts , but instead its has dwell too much on the ecstasy of vanquishing the enemy . The Japanese is making the concerted effort of making the story real , as the hero facing his fear , his conquering of his laziness and so on . Put in one word , the Japanese novel is more looking at the process not the result . Chinese tend to be unrealistic who wish the reap the fruit of his the goals without sowing , as for something not attainable , instead of struggle , Chinese tend to indulging the idea of miracles would strike . Something exterior will help make it happened , one does not has to struggle by himself . The Japanese does not believe in miracles , you reap what you sow , its that simple . I think the key point here is that the Chinese has a bad ethics , it is the Chinese innate fantasy of reaching all the goals without put in effort and making sacrifice . As for what\u2019s real , until today , Chinese is still conceive a ambiguous understanding . Chinese enjoy self-deception , who does not dwell too much on reality , but inclined to embrace miracle and believing that miracle will happen . The true miracle stem from innate struggle and hardship , but this does not please the Chinese . Chinese enjoy exterior miracle which will spare their endeavor and concerted effort of hardship , Chinese is a childish race , is the one enjoying self-deception . Most importantly , Chinese is a race who is harboring with an fanciful idea one can reap things without sowing . In comparence with the Japanese of who trust what\u2019s real , and believing hardship and good at challenge oneself , the difference is enormous . This is the result of observation after I making the comparence between the two nation . The marital art novels . sorry , everyone , I said Three essay on CHinese , but after all i decide to post two here , since the other one looks kinda provocative . Thanks for reading",
