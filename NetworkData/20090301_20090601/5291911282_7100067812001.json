There has always been a healthy exchange of views by members, although at times degenerating into personal attacks, name calling and unwarranted accusations. However, for the most part there was intelligent discourse by knowledgeable, intelligent and experienced veterans and military supporters. Recently, however, the majority of posts seem to consist of outrageous personal attacks, name calling, outright stupidity, ignorance, hatred and bigotry. The new generation of posters rely primarily on emotion to express themselves rather than logic and reasoned discourse. There is little respect shown toward others and a general lack of decorum expected from adults. I have enjoyed my time spent at Mil.com and have learned a great deal from the fine people who post here (even those with whom I disagree). It's always rewarding to learn what values people hold and why they believe as they do. I hope the quality of posts and posters improves at Mil.com.",
