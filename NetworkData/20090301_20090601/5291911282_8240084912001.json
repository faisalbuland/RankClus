(My first time owning one) I'm looking at a 16' Scampi and a 17' Airstream. Both come with small bathroom, sink, refrigerator, microwave, two burner stove, A/C, table and LP gas containers. The Scampi cost about $12,000 and the Airstream cost $31,000. Any suggestions? I plan on using it maybe 6 months out of the year on short trips of 3 or 4 days at a time. Any photos or help will be enjoyed by me.",

I'd suggest you get one with the axles under the springs for more clearance. I moved my axles under the springs so my camper trailer could go anywhere I dared go with my crewcab 4X4 Chevy Ton truck that I had at the time. You can see I also put a 12 ft fishing boat on top and hauled a 5 horse power outboard motor in the sleeper, along with supplies, etc. I carried extra tanks for a total of 80 gallon of gas, back when it was 50 cent a gallon. We could go 1100-1500 mile on one fill-up!! Those where the good ole days!! I gave my trailer to one of the boys - - If I ever got another one, it would be something like this: Airstreams are top of the line, but way expensive. Half of that price could go into your tank to drag around something near as good a long, long, long ways!!

Be well my friend and thanks again. Well, Duster, the thing to think about is that the thing is gona sit alot more than being used. Why sink tons of money into something you won't use a lot? It you just want to see the country, get a good extended cab pickup like the Ghost Space Shuttle up there (I'd suggest gasoline now that diesel is more expensive), put a nice sleeper on it, mainly for carrying plenty of luggage, stuff, and maybe the dog at night - Then stay in Holiday Inn and Best Western Motels. The price of a travel trailer will pay for a TON of stays in nice Motels, and they make the beds!! Same with meals - If you like eating your own cooking, fine; but wrapped up in the cost of that Travel Trailer is the money for a LOT of good meals at nice sit down Restaurants, and they do the dishes - - That's why I gave my trailer to one of the boys, I just got tired of setting up, leveling and all that at campgrounds, and I didn't want Mystical to have all the hassle of \"keeping kitchen\" when we were out traveling and seeing the country - - Now, if you're looking for the \"Camp Ground Experience\", go for it!! Again, the little white Nomad above is a 18 footer. I'd prefer something a little longer. Longer trailers pull better/smoother/less squirrely, and more room for stuff! A longer trailer with a small table in the middle and sleeping area up front allows you to leave the bed down day after day, instead of completely having to put it away every morning just so you can open the doors and let people in and out or eat breakfast - here is another great-looking trailer: I'm not much for fifth-wheel trailers, because they deny you the use of the bed of your truck for other things - - A few years ago Mystical and I traveled all over Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming in the Ghost Space Shuttle, staying in Holiday Inns, and having a great time. We had plenty of room for stuff, rode in style, swam in the pools, ate in nice places, slept in comfort - and the hassle for her was minimal - - a great time - - I prefer traveling in a 4 wheel drive, to take some of the roads most people might not - to see a little more. By the way, the longer the towing vehicle, the better the trailer pulls. The Blue Bomber and the Grey Ghost Shuttle pull like a Locomotive on steel rails. The Grey Ghost was okay, but Dad's short bed Ford was MURDER! In fact, he actually jack-knifed it once and the Ford turned over (with minimal damage). He passed a slower outfit on a two lane highway, and when he took his foot off the gas, it started fish-tailing, and the trailer shoved him off the road. I pulled the trailer with the shortbed Ford one year, and GOT RID OF IT! Short wheelbase and heavy trailers don't mix!!

I only plan of using this camper trailer for two maybe three years and I understand I will lose money on it but thats the way it goes some times. Looks like you raised a fine boy in your photos.

Both come with small bathroom, sink, refrigerator, microwave, two burner stove, A/C, table and LP gas containers. The Scampi cost about $12,000 and the Airstream cost $31,000. Any suggestions? I plan on using it maybe 6 months out of the year on short trips of 3 or 4 days at a time. Any photos or help will be enjoyed by me. Just a suggestion buy a used one to start off with make sure that is what you want to do, I have known alot of people that went all out on buying a camper then after it sat in their yard for a year or more they decided to sell it and take a loss. I have two small travel trailers One Is just for when i go camping, the other will be better equiped for when my wife goes with me. total spent on these was about 1k if i decide i dont need one of them i can easly get my money back, D.J.",

Problem was, the brakes weren't all that good, and sometimes I had a helluva time getting it stopped!!! Dad was a Ford man, and me too, but the Recon tracks in the Army had 283 Chevy motors in 'em, so I got used to working on them and the transmissions both. When Dad died, I took over his short bed 73 Ford with a 390 in it - Now THAT was a death trap, especially pulling the trailer!! It would get squirrely in a heartbeat! So I got that long crewcab. You talk about smooth-pulling at 60-70 MPH, like a train on tracks. With four big boys and Mystical, plenty of room - cuz I put a crawl-through boot into the sleeper... It was like a Bus!!!

Be well my friend and thanks again. Well, Duster, the thing to think about is that the thing is gona sit alot more than being used. Why sink tons of money into something you won't use a lot? It you just want to see the country, get a good extended cab pickup like the Ghost Space Shuttle up there (I'd suggest gasoline now that diesel is more expensive), put a nice sleeper on it, mainly for carrying plenty of luggage, stuff, and maybe the dog at night - Then stay in Holiday Inn and Best Western Motels. The price of a travel trailer will pay for a TON of stays in nice Motels, and they make the beds!! Same with meals - If you like eating your own cooking, fine; but wrapped up in the cost of that Travel Trailer is the money for a LOT of good meals at nice sit down Restaurants, and they do the dishes - - That's why I gave my trailer to one of the boys, I just got tired of setting up, leveling and all that at campgrounds, and I didn't want Mystical to have all the hassle of \"keeping kitchen\" when we were out traveling and seeing the country - - Now, if you're looking for the \"Camp Ground Experience\", go for it!! Again, the little white Nomad above is a 18 footer. I'd prefer something a little longer. Longer trailers pull better/smoother/less squirrely, and more room for stuff! A longer trailer with a small table in the middle and sleeping area up front allows you to leave the bed down day after day, instead of completely having to put it away every morning just so you can open the doors and let people in and out or eat breakfast - here is another great-looking trailer: I'm not much for fifth-wheel trailers, because they deny you the use of the bed of your truck for other things - - A few years ago Mystical and I traveled all over Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming in the Ghost Space Shuttle, staying in Holiday Inns, and having a great time. We had plenty of room for stuff, rode in style, swam in the pools, ate in nice places, slept in comfort - and the hassle for her was minimal - - a great time - - I prefer traveling in a 4 wheel drive, to take some of the roads most people might not - to see a little more. By the way, the longer the towing vehicle, the better the trailer pulls. The Blue Bomber and the Grey Ghost Shuttle pull like a Locomotive on steel rails. The Grey Ghost was okay, but Dad's short bed Ford was MURDER! In fact, he actually jack-knifed it once and the Ford turned over (with minimal damage). He passed a slower outfit on a two lane highway, and when he took his foot off the gas, it started fish-tailing, and the trailer shoved him off the road. I pulled the trailer with the shortbed Ford one year, and GOT RID OF IT! Short wheelbase and heavy trailers don't mix!!
