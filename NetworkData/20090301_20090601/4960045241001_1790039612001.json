Why are legal documents, that are open for public review, locked away from public scrutiny? Documents such as his birth certificate, college records, passport records and others are supposed to be available for scrutiny under the Freedom of Information Act, but are sealed and that makes me wary that there maybe some sort of deception. The best thing that could happen would be for these records, with sensitive information blocked out, to be brought forth and lay all of this worry to rest.

Nobody in the main stream media went into detail on this and they are normally the ones who do the hard investigative reporting for America. We, as Americans, are then able to have focused debate on the matter. Since all of the main stream media outlets were on the wagon for Obama, none of them went after him like they should have. This creates a problem for most Americans, because we rely on the main stream media to give us unbiased reporting on important issues. Obama has made several major mistakes in judgment and made some serious errors in his actions that will possibly bring harm to America. His closing of Gitmo, the quest for granting terrorists civil legal rights, the reduction of military funding, the constant call for tax increases during a recession, his fight for universal health care and the requirement that our records be on a national database, his call for nationwide unionization, and numerous others are detrimental to America. Total disclosure is the only thing that will clear this problem up and we, as a nation, deserve nothing less than total disclosure.

But, for this officer to be creating all this dissension in the ranks is quite unprofessional. Yes, and I am a republican and did not vote for him because he is Prochoice !

He has a long list of problematic alliances and associates, that give me pause as to the man's judgment. He received his community organization training, from a man who was trained by Saul Alinsky, a devout Marxist and communist. Go figure that he would lean way to the left. As for Bush being stupid or unworthy of his office, he aquitted himself well in the office. This will be brought out over time as history will eventually record.

Please read our TOS and stickies at the top of the forums for the rules for posting on this site Mainedawg Moderator And yes, I called them LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; They're liberals, they're idiots and they're Democrats - need I say more. Why were we told by LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Chris Dodd and others, that the sub-prime lending institutions and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were solvent and in good fiscal condition, when they were clearly in trouble? Everyone of these people had received campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, that's why. They had a vested interest in these organizations. Barack Obama did legal work for them, before he became an Illinois senator. Is there a problem with having this man as President and Commander-in-Chief, yes there is. It isn't a racial problem, it is an ideological problem. The man is a social communist and has the wrong ideology for America. We don't need or want the US government wiping our butts and noses for us from cradle to grave. Big government will only want to get bigger and to do that, it will need to create more people to \"help\" and that means more assistance and entitlement programs. These programs will require higher taxes on the working class to support the non-working class, thus creating a class warfare conundrum that will bring down America. Obama has already made a number of moves that are detrimental to the US. He is closing Gitmo, without a plan of what to do with the prisoners-of-war that are there. He wants to give these prisoners-of-war civil rights and allow them to have protection under civil law. They are military prisoners-of-war and do not rate the legal distinction of civil law recipients. This would set a far reaching precedent for future conflicts. He has reduced funding for various military units around the world, thus curtailing their training and supplies. He has stated that he will not renew our nuclear arsenal, yet our enemies are building newer weapons everyday. His talk of tax increases has tanked our stock market. Since his election the Dow has lost $2.2 trillion dollars in value and continues to fall. Under his \"leadership\" over the last forty-six days (46), he has brought this country down to its lowest point since the Carter administration and we are headed for the same disasterous numbers of that era. Double digit inflation, unemployment, interest rates and massive job loss will be the legacy of this man. We cannot tax ourselves into prosperity and this has been proven over and over world-wide. Excessive taxation causes a slow down in just about every facet of an economy, except government spending and government spending doesn't create anything toward a countries GDP. We cannot afford Obama and his ObamAbomination. America will suffer greatly over the next several years, if this LIBERAL IDIOT and those working for him are allowed to do what they have planned.

The real Hawaiian certificate is a Certificate, not a certification. In checking my own birth certificate and that of my daughter, son, and wife; they all say Certificate of Live Birth, not certification. Now, look at the info from the URL for \"You Decide Politics\". Do you see a problem with the two documents? One is a real Certificate of Live Birth and the other is a Certification, and it doesn't look anything like a real certificate. Much of the necessary info is missing. After doing more digging, I found a website and there was the fake certificate, but it was for a marriage, not a birth. The certificate can be custom designed any way you want it for an extra fee. There has been some concern that the certificate that has been floated around as Obama's birth certificate, is a fake. There are supposed to be very subtle discrepencies in the certificate, that have been studied by various people with a background in forensic investigations. If you can get a good clear image of the fake certificate and increase the magnification on it to about 200-400%, you can see areas of disturbed pixelation around Obama's name, birth date, sex, place of birth and others. This looks suspicious in and of itself, as though there have been changes to the info. You will also notice that all the info on the document is in uppercase letters, but the birth date and file date are in upper and lower case letters. This too is suspicious. If you look down in the lower left corner of the \"fake\" certificate, you will find (Rev. 11/01)LASER. How can this be a real certificate? You can't have a 1961 birth on a 2001 certificate, unless it says it is a certified copy and it has an official stamp or seal, neither of which appear on this document. This could mean that this is a forgery. Obama needs to bring forth his ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE, with the appropriate info blacked out and dispel this cloud of controversy. If he can't produce this document or any real and indisputable proof, he needs to step down as POTUS. McCain had to prove his eligibility and he provided the necessary documents and was vetted by the proper authorities and by the media and accepted by the people. Obama hasn't done so and will continue to have these problems as long as he refuses to produce the necessary documentation. Anything that he does in office will be null and void, if he is found to be in the office fraudulently. There is no racism here or partisan BS, just a desire to see that this situation be resolved. All it takes is for Obama to produce a CERTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED birth certificate or other CERTIFIED OFFICIAL DOCUMENT. hot links removed. MD This message has been edited.

Why are legal documents, that are open for public review, locked away from public scrutiny?

This creates a problem for most Americans, because we rely on the main stream media to give us unbiased reporting on important issues. Obama has made several major mistakes in judgment and made some serious errors in his actions that will possibly bring harm to America. His closing of Gitmo, the quest for granting terrorists civil legal rights, the reduction of military funding, the constant call for tax increases during a recession, his fight for universal health care and the requirement that our records be on a national database, his call for nationwide unionization, and numerous others are detrimental to America.

It is typical of the type of people who Obama worked with and the type of work that he performed before taking office. The main stream media never vetted him like they vetted other candidates and that is a shameful mistake on their part. He has a long list of problematic alliances and associates, that give me pause as to the man's judgment. He received his community organization training, from a man who was trained by Saul Alinsky, a devout Marxist and communist. Go figure that he would lean way to the left. As for Bush being stupid or unworthy of his office, he aquitted himself well in the office. This will be brought out over time as history will eventually record.

Please read our TOS and stickies at the top of the forums for the rules for posting on this site Mainedawg Moderator And yes, I called them LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; They're liberals, they're idiots and they're Democrats - need I say more. Why were we told by LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Chris Dodd and others, that the sub-prime lending institutions and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were solvent and in good fiscal condition, when they were clearly in trouble? Everyone of these people had received campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, that's why. They had a vested interest in these organizations. Barack Obama did legal work for them, before he became an Illinois senator. Is there a problem with having this man as President and Commander-in-Chief, yes there is. It isn't a racial problem, it is an ideological problem. The man is a social communist and has the wrong ideology for America. We don't need or want the US government wiping our butts and noses for us from cradle to grave. Big government will only want to get bigger and to do that, it will need to create more people to \"help\" and that means more assistance and entitlement programs. These programs will require higher taxes on the working class to support the non-working class, thus creating a class warfare conundrum that will bring down America. Obama has already made a number of moves that are detrimental to the US. He is closing Gitmo, without a plan of what to do with the prisoners-of-war that are there. He wants to give these prisoners-of-war civil rights and allow them to have protection under civil law. They are military prisoners-of-war and do not rate the legal distinction of civil law recipients. This would set a far reaching precedent for future conflicts. He has reduced funding for various military units around the world, thus curtailing their training and supplies. He has stated that he will not renew our nuclear arsenal, yet our enemies are building newer weapons everyday. His talk of tax increases has tanked our stock market. Since his election the Dow has lost $2.2 trillion dollars in value and continues to fall. Under his \"leadership\" over the last forty-six days (46), he has brought this country down to its lowest point since the Carter administration and we are headed for the same disasterous numbers of that era. Double digit inflation, unemployment, interest rates and massive job loss will be the legacy of this man. We cannot tax ourselves into prosperity and this has been proven over and over world-wide. Excessive taxation causes a slow down in just about every facet of an economy, except government spending and government spending doesn't create anything toward a countries GDP. We cannot afford Obama and his ObamAbomination. America will suffer greatly over the next several years, if this LIBERAL IDIOT and those working for him are allowed to do what they have planned.

The real Hawaiian certificate is a Certificate, not a certification. In checking my own birth certificate and that of my daughter, son, and wife; they all say Certificate of Live Birth, not certification. Now, look at the info from the URL for \"You Decide Politics\". Do you see a problem with the two documents? One is a real Certificate of Live Birth and the other is a Certification, and it doesn't look anything like a real certificate. Much of the necessary info is missing. After doing more digging, I found a website and there was the fake certificate, but it was for a marriage, not a birth. The certificate can be custom designed any way you want it for an extra fee. There has been some concern that the certificate that has been floated around as Obama's birth certificate, is a fake. There are supposed to be very subtle discrepencies in the certificate, that have been studied by various people with a background in forensic investigations. If you can get a good clear image of the fake certificate and increase the magnification on it to about 200-400%, you can see areas of disturbed pixelation around Obama's name, birth date, sex, place of birth and others. This looks suspicious in and of itself, as though there have been changes to the info. You will also notice that all the info on the document is in uppercase letters, but the birth date and file date are in upper and lower case letters. This too is suspicious. If you look down in the lower left corner of the \"fake\" certificate, you will find (Rev. 11/01)LASER. How can this be a real certificate? You can't have a 1961 birth on a 2001 certificate, unless it says it is a certified copy and it has an official stamp or seal, neither of which appear on this document. This could mean that this is a forgery. Obama needs to bring forth his ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE, with the appropriate info blacked out and dispel this cloud of controversy. If he can't produce this document or any real and indisputable proof, he needs to step down as POTUS. McCain had to prove his eligibility and he provided the necessary documents and was vetted by the proper authorities and by the media and accepted by the people. Obama hasn't done so and will continue to have these problems as long as he refuses to produce the necessary documentation. Anything that he does in office will be null and void, if he is found to be in the office fraudulently. There is no racism here or partisan BS, just a desire to see that this situation be resolved. All it takes is for Obama to produce a CERTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED birth certificate or other CERTIFIED OFFICIAL DOCUMENT. hot links removed. MD This message has been edited.

Why are legal documents, that are open for public review, locked away from public scrutiny?

This creates a problem for most Americans, because we rely on the main stream media to give us unbiased reporting on important issues. Obama has made several major mistakes in judgment and made some serious errors in his actions that will possibly bring harm to America. His closing of Gitmo, the quest for granting terrorists civil legal rights, the reduction of military funding, the constant call for tax increases during a recession, his fight for universal health care and the requirement that our records be on a national database, his call for nationwide unionization, and numerous others are detrimental to America.

You had best get off this kick and learn how to be an officer, or go back home to Mommy and live out your life playing with your X-Box in your bedroom.</p><p>Obama happens to be the first intelligent President we've had in 8 years and we had all better pray that he is smart enough to repair the damage Bush has done to the world.</p><p>But hey, even though Bush was possibly the worst President we ever had, we showed respect to him as Commander-in-Chief.",

He has a long list of problematic alliances and associates, that give me pause as to the man's judgment. He received his community organization training, from a man who was trained by Saul Alinsky, a devout Marxist and communist. Go figure that he would lean way to the left.

Please read our TOS and stickies at the top of the forums for the rules for posting on this site Mainedawg Moderator And yes, I called them LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; They're liberals, they're idiots and they're Democrats - need I say more. Why were we told by LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Chris Dodd and others, that the sub-prime lending institutions and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were solvent and in good fiscal condition, when they were clearly in trouble? Everyone of these people had received campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, that's why. They had a vested interest in these organizations. Barack Obama did legal work for them, before he became an Illinois senator. Is there a problem with having this man as President and Commander-in-Chief, yes there is. It isn't a racial problem, it is an ideological problem. The man is a social communist and has the wrong ideology for America. We don't need or want the US government wiping our butts and noses for us from cradle to grave. Big government will only want to get bigger and to do that, it will need to create more people to \"help\" and that means more assistance and entitlement programs. These programs will require higher taxes on the working class to support the non-working class, thus creating a class warfare conundrum that will bring down America. Obama has already made a number of moves that are detrimental to the US. He is closing Gitmo, without a plan of what to do with the prisoners-of-war that are there. He wants to give these prisoners-of-war civil rights and allow them to have protection under civil law. They are military prisoners-of-war and do not rate the legal distinction of civil law recipients. This would set a far reaching precedent for future conflicts. He has reduced funding for various military units around the world, thus curtailing their training and supplies. He has stated that he will not renew our nuclear arsenal, yet our enemies are building newer weapons everyday. His talk of tax increases has tanked our stock market. Since his election the Dow has lost $2.2 trillion dollars in value and continues to fall. Under his \"leadership\" over the last forty-six days (46), he has brought this country down to its lowest point since the Carter administration and we are headed for the same disasterous numbers of that era. Double digit inflation, unemployment, interest rates and massive job loss will be the legacy of this man. We cannot tax ourselves into prosperity and this has been proven over and over world-wide. Excessive taxation causes a slow down in just about every facet of an economy, except government spending and government spending doesn't create anything toward a countries GDP. We cannot afford Obama and his ObamAbomination. America will suffer greatly over the next several years, if this LIBERAL IDIOT and those working for him are allowed to do what they have planned.

The real Hawaiian certificate is a Certificate, not a certification. In checking my own birth certificate and that of my daughter, son, and wife; they all say Certificate of Live Birth, not certification. Now, look at the info from the URL for \"You Decide Politics\". Do you see a problem with the two documents? One is a real Certificate of Live Birth and the other is a Certification, and it doesn't look anything like a real certificate. Much of the necessary info is missing. After doing more digging, I found a website and there was the fake certificate, but it was for a marriage, not a birth. The certificate can be custom designed any way you want it for an extra fee. There has been some concern that the certificate that has been floated around as Obama's birth certificate, is a fake. There are supposed to be very subtle discrepencies in the certificate, that have been studied by various people with a background in forensic investigations. If you can get a good clear image of the fake certificate and increase the magnification on it to about 200-400%, you can see areas of disturbed pixelation around Obama's name, birth date, sex, place of birth and others. This looks suspicious in and of itself, as though there have been changes to the info. You will also notice that all the info on the document is in uppercase letters, but the birth date and file date are in upper and lower case letters. This too is suspicious. If you look down in the lower left corner of the \"fake\" certificate, you will find (Rev. 11/01)LASER. How can this be a real certificate? You can't have a 1961 birth on a 2001 certificate, unless it says it is a certified copy and it has an official stamp or seal, neither of which appear on this document. This could mean that this is a forgery. Obama needs to bring forth his ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE, with the appropriate info blacked out and dispel this cloud of controversy. If he can't produce this document or any real and indisputable proof, he needs to step down as POTUS. McCain had to prove his eligibility and he provided the necessary documents and was vetted by the proper authorities and by the media and accepted by the people. Obama hasn't done so and will continue to have these problems as long as he refuses to produce the necessary documentation. Anything that he does in office will be null and void, if he is found to be in the office fraudulently. There is no racism here or partisan BS, just a desire to see that this situation be resolved. All it takes is for Obama to produce a CERTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED birth certificate or other CERTIFIED OFFICIAL DOCUMENT. hot links removed. MD This message has been edited.

Why are legal documents, that are open for public review, locked away from public scrutiny?

This creates a problem for most Americans, because we rely on the main stream media to give us unbiased reporting on important issues. Obama has made several major mistakes in judgment and made some serious errors in his actions that will possibly bring harm to America. His closing of Gitmo, the quest for granting terrorists civil legal rights, the reduction of military funding, the constant call for tax increases during a recession, his fight for universal health care and the requirement that our records be on a national database, his call for nationwide unionization, and numerous others are detrimental to America.

He has a long list of problematic alliances and associates, that give me pause as to the man's judgment. He received his community organization training, from a man who was trained by Saul Alinsky, a devout Marxist and communist. Go figure that he would lean way to the left.

Please read our TOS and stickies at the top of the forums for the rules for posting on this site Mainedawg Moderator And yes, I called them LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; They're liberals, they're idiots and they're Democrats - need I say more. Why were we told by LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Chris Dodd and others, that the sub-prime lending institutions and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were solvent and in good fiscal condition, when they were clearly in trouble? Everyone of these people had received campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, that's why. They had a vested interest in these organizations. Barack Obama did legal work for them, before he became an Illinois senator. Is there a problem with having this man as President and Commander-in-Chief, yes there is. It isn't a racial problem, it is an ideological problem. The man is a social communist and has the wrong ideology for America. We don't need or want the US government wiping our butts and noses for us from cradle to grave. Big government will only want to get bigger and to do that, it will need to create more people to \"help\" and that means more assistance and entitlement programs. These programs will require higher taxes on the working class to support the non-working class, thus creating a class warfare conundrum that will bring down America. Obama has already made a number of moves that are detrimental to the US. He is closing Gitmo, without a plan of what to do with the prisoners-of-war that are there. He wants to give these prisoners-of-war civil rights and allow them to have protection under civil law. They are military prisoners-of-war and do not rate the legal distinction of civil law recipients. This would set a far reaching precedent for future conflicts. He has reduced funding for various military units around the world, thus curtailing their training and supplies. He has stated that he will not renew our nuclear arsenal, yet our enemies are building newer weapons everyday. His talk of tax increases has tanked our stock market. Since his election the Dow has lost $2.2 trillion dollars in value and continues to fall. Under his \"leadership\" over the last forty-six days (46), he has brought this country down to its lowest point since the Carter administration and we are headed for the same disasterous numbers of that era. Double digit inflation, unemployment, interest rates and massive job loss will be the legacy of this man. We cannot tax ourselves into prosperity and this has been proven over and over world-wide. Excessive taxation causes a slow down in just about every facet of an economy, except government spending and government spending doesn't create anything toward a countries GDP. We cannot afford Obama and his ObamAbomination. America will suffer greatly over the next several years, if this LIBERAL IDIOT and those working for him are allowed to do what they have planned.

The real Hawaiian certificate is a Certificate, not a certification. In checking my own birth certificate and that of my daughter, son, and wife; they all say Certificate of Live Birth, not certification. Now, look at the info from the URL for \"You Decide Politics\". Do you see a problem with the two documents? One is a real Certificate of Live Birth and the other is a Certification, and it doesn't look anything like a real certificate. Much of the necessary info is missing. After doing more digging, I found a website and there was the fake certificate, but it was for a marriage, not a birth. The certificate can be custom designed any way you want it for an extra fee. There has been some concern that the certificate that has been floated around as Obama's birth certificate, is a fake. There are supposed to be very subtle discrepencies in the certificate, that have been studied by various people with a background in forensic investigations. If you can get a good clear image of the fake certificate and increase the magnification on it to about 200-400%, you can see areas of disturbed pixelation around Obama's name, birth date, sex, place of birth and others. This looks suspicious in and of itself, as though there have been changes to the info. You will also notice that all the info on the document is in uppercase letters, but the birth date and file date are in upper and lower case letters. This too is suspicious. If you look down in the lower left corner of the \"fake\" certificate, you will find (Rev. 11/01)LASER. How can this be a real certificate? You can't have a 1961 birth on a 2001 certificate, unless it says it is a certified copy and it has an official stamp or seal, neither of which appear on this document. This could mean that this is a forgery. Obama needs to bring forth his ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE, with the appropriate info blacked out and dispel this cloud of controversy. If he can't produce this document or any real and indisputable proof, he needs to step down as POTUS. McCain had to prove his eligibility and he provided the necessary documents and was vetted by the proper authorities and by the media and accepted by the people. Obama hasn't done so and will continue to have these problems as long as he refuses to produce the necessary documentation. Anything that he does in office will be null and void, if he is found to be in the office fraudulently. There is no racism here or partisan BS, just a desire to see that this situation be resolved. All it takes is for Obama to produce a CERTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED birth certificate or other CERTIFIED OFFICIAL DOCUMENT. hot links removed. MD This message has been edited.

Why were we told by LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Chris Dodd and others, that the sub-prime lending institutions and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were solvent and in good fiscal condition, when they were clearly in trouble? Everyone of these people had received campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, that's why. They had a vested interest in these organizations. Barack Obama did legal work for them, before he became an Illinois senator. Is there a problem with having this man as President and Commander-in-Chief, yes there is. It isn't a racial problem, it is an ideological problem. The man is a social communist and has the wrong ideology for America. We don't need or want the US government wiping our butts and noses for us from cradle to grave. Big government will only want to get bigger and to do that, it will need to create more people to \"help\" and that means more assistance and entitlement programs. These programs will require higher taxes on the working class to support the non-working class, thus creating a class warfare conundrum that will bring down America. Obama has already made a number of moves that are detrimental to the US. He is closing Gitmo, without a plan of what to do with the prisoners-of-war that are there. He wants to give these prisoners-of-war civil rights and allow them to have protection under civil law. They are military prisoners-of-war and do not rate the legal distinction of civil law recipients. This would set a far reaching precedent for future conflicts. He has reduced funding for various military units around the world, thus curtailing their training and supplies. He has stated that he will not renew our nuclear arsenal, yet our enemies are building newer weapons everyday. His talk of tax increases has tanked our stock market. Since his election the Dow has lost $2.2 trillion dollars in value and continues to fall. Under his \"leadership\" over the last forty-six days (46), he has brought this country down to its lowest point since the Carter administration and we are headed for the same disasterous numbers of that era. Double digit inflation, unemployment, interest rates and massive job loss will be the legacy of this man. We cannot tax ourselves into prosperity and this has been proven over and over world-wide. Excessive taxation causes a slow down in just about every facet of an economy, except government spending and government spending doesn't create anything toward a countries GDP. We cannot afford Obama and his ObamAbomination. America will suffer greatly over the next several years, if this LIBERAL IDIOT and those working for him are allowed to do what they have planned.

The real Hawaiian certificate is a Certificate, not a certification. In checking my own birth certificate and that of my daughter, son, and wife; they all say Certificate of Live Birth, not certification. Now, look at the info from the URL for \"You Decide Politics\". Do you see a problem with the two documents? One is a real Certificate of Live Birth and the other is a Certification, and it doesn't look anything like a real certificate. Much of the necessary info is missing. After doing more digging, I found a website and there was the fake certificate, but it was for a marriage, not a birth. The certificate can be custom designed any way you want it for an extra fee. There has been some concern that the certificate that has been floated around as Obama's birth certificate, is a fake. There are supposed to be very subtle discrepencies in the certificate, that have been studied by various people with a background in forensic investigations. If you can get a good clear image of the fake certificate and increase the magnification on it to about 200-400%, you can see areas of disturbed pixelation around Obama's name, birth date, sex, place of birth and others. This looks suspicious in and of itself, as though there have been changes to the info. You will also notice that all the info on the document is in uppercase letters, but the birth date and file date are in upper and lower case letters. This too is suspicious. If you look down in the lower left corner of the \"fake\" certificate, you will find (Rev. 11/01)LASER. How can this be a real certificate? You can't have a 1961 birth on a 2001 certificate, unless it says it is a certified copy and it has an official stamp or seal, neither of which appear on this document. This could mean that this is a forgery. Obama needs to bring forth his ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE, with the appropriate info blacked out and dispel this cloud of controversy. If he can't produce this document or any real and indisputable proof, he needs to step down as POTUS. McCain had to prove his eligibility and he provided the necessary documents and was vetted by the proper authorities and by the media and accepted by the people. Obama hasn't done so and will continue to have these problems as long as he refuses to produce the necessary documentation. Anything that he does in office will be null and void, if he is found to be in the office fraudulently. There is no racism here or partisan BS, just a desire to see that this situation be resolved. All it takes is for Obama to produce a CERTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED birth certificate or other CERTIFIED OFFICIAL DOCUMENT. hot links removed. MD This message has been edited.

Why are legal documents, that are open for public review, locked away from public scrutiny?

This creates a problem for most Americans, because we rely on the main stream media to give us unbiased reporting on important issues. Obama has made several major mistakes in judgment and made some serious errors in his actions that will possibly bring harm to America. His closing of Gitmo, the quest for granting terrorists civil legal rights, the reduction of military funding, the constant call for tax increases during a recession, his fight for universal health care and the requirement that our records be on a national database, his call for nationwide unionization, and numerous others are detrimental to America.

He has a long list of problematic alliances and associates, that give me pause as to the man's judgment.

Please read our TOS and stickies at the top of the forums for the rules for posting on this site Mainedawg Moderator And yes, I called them LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; They're liberals, they're idiots and they're Democrats - need I say more. Why were we told by LIBERAL IDIOT Democrats; Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Chris Dodd and others, that the sub-prime lending institutions and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were solvent and in good fiscal condition, when they were clearly in trouble? Everyone of these people had received campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, that's why. They had a vested interest in these organizations. Barack Obama did legal work for them, before he became an Illinois senator. Is there a problem with having this man as President and Commander-in-Chief, yes there is. It isn't a racial problem, it is an ideological problem. The man is a social communist and has the wrong ideology for America. We don't need or want the US government wiping our butts and noses for us from cradle to grave. Big government will only want to get bigger and to do that, it will need to create more people to \"help\" and that means more assistance and entitlement programs. These programs will require higher taxes on the working class to support the non-working class, thus creating a class warfare conundrum that will bring down America. Obama has already made a number of moves that are detrimental to the US. He is closing Gitmo, without a plan of what to do with the prisoners-of-war that are there. He wants to give these prisoners-of-war civil rights and allow them to have protection under civil law. They are military prisoners-of-war and do not rate the legal distinction of civil law recipients. This would set a far reaching precedent for future conflicts. He has reduced funding for various military units around the world, thus curtailing their training and supplies. He has stated that he will not renew our nuclear arsenal, yet our enemies are building newer weapons everyday. His talk of tax increases has tanked our stock market. Since his election the Dow has lost $2.2 trillion dollars in value and continues to fall. Under his \"leadership\" over the last forty-six days (46), he has brought this country down to its lowest point since the Carter administration and we are headed for the same disasterous numbers of that era. Double digit inflation, unemployment, interest rates and massive job loss will be the legacy of this man. We cannot tax ourselves into prosperity and this has been proven over and over world-wide. Excessive taxation causes a slow down in just about every facet of an economy, except government spending and government spending doesn't create anything toward a countries GDP. We cannot afford Obama and his ObamAbomination. America will suffer greatly over the next several years, if this LIBERAL IDIOT and those working for him are allowed to do what they have planned.

The real Hawaiian certificate is a Certificate, not a certification. In checking my own birth certificate and that of my daughter, son, and wife; they all say Certificate of Live Birth, not certification. Now, look at the info from the URL for \"You Decide Politics\". Do you see a problem with the two documents? One is a real Certificate of Live Birth and the other is a Certification, and it doesn't look anything like a real certificate. Much of the necessary info is missing. After doing more digging, I found a website and there was the fake certificate, but it was for a marriage, not a birth. The certificate can be custom designed any way you want it for an extra fee. There has been some concern that the certificate that has been floated around as Obama's birth certificate, is a fake. There are supposed to be very subtle discrepencies in the certificate, that have been studied by various people with a background in forensic investigations. If you can get a good clear image of the fake certificate and increase the magnification on it to about 200-400%, you can see areas of disturbed pixelation around Obama's name, birth date, sex, place of birth and others. This looks suspicious in and of itself, as though there have been changes to the info. You will also notice that all the info on the document is in uppercase letters, but the birth date and file date are in upper and lower case letters. This too is suspicious. If you look down in the lower left corner of the \"fake\" certificate, you will find (Rev. 11/01)LASER. How can this be a real certificate? You can't have a 1961 birth on a 2001 certificate, unless it says it is a certified copy and it has an official stamp or seal, neither of which appear on this document. This could mean that this is a forgery. Obama needs to bring forth his ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE, with the appropriate info blacked out and dispel this cloud of controversy. If he can't produce this document or any real and indisputable proof, he needs to step down as POTUS. McCain had to prove his eligibility and he provided the necessary documents and was vetted by the proper authorities and by the media and accepted by the people. Obama hasn't done so and will continue to have these problems as long as he refuses to produce the necessary documentation. Anything that he does in office will be null and void, if he is found to be in the office fraudulently. There is no racism here or partisan BS, just a desire to see that this situation be resolved. All it takes is for Obama to produce a CERTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED birth certificate or other CERTIFIED OFFICIAL DOCUMENT. hot links removed. MD This message has been edited.
