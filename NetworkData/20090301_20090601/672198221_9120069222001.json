(AP) - Federal officials plan to start construction within weeks on a new \"virtual fence\" along the U.S.-Mexico border that they say could almost completely cover the nearly 2,000-mile frontier within five years. The first permanent towers holding sensors, cameras and communications gear to detect drug smugglers and illegal immigrants will be built along 53 miles of Arizona's border with Mexico, said Mark Borkowski, a Customs and Border Protection official in charge of the program. He briefed The Associated Press in advance of a general announcement expected on Friday. More towers, up to 120 feet tall and spaced miles apart, will follow on the remaining 320 miles of the state's southern border. Virtual fencing then will go up in New Mexico, followed by California and most of Texas, said Borkowski, executive director of the Homeland Security Department's Secure Border Initiative program. \"Construction should start imminently,\" Borkowski said. \"We're in the final throes of convincing ourselves that the engineering is fine.\" The plans follow a prototype virtual fence that federal officials and others found inadequate for the job, and Borkowski said improvement probably will be made to the final version after border agents begin using it. Depending on funding, the whole southwestern border except for about 200 miles around Big Bend National Park in Texas would be covered by 2014, Borkowski said. That area would also eventually be outfitted with the system. \"It's in our list of to-dos,\" Borkowski said. \"It's just such a rugged area, we think it's the last place we need to do.\"",
