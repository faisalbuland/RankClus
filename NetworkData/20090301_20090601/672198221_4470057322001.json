Payroll records are not public to the employees, and since the workers cannot read of write English one would assume they do not speak it either. so... how does the guy complaining KNOW what they make unless he speaks the language of the other guy and was told by the target? in other words, i see a LOT of assuming here, and still little fact. are there any supporting stories from other papers? any interviews with FAA? any interviews with the companies? inquiries?

This is a scam in the following order: 1.The way these things work is that small groups of people want to divert workers' paychecks into their own bank account. This is illegal. Plus, the workers would have a recourse: they can have their days in court. 2. NOW: since the above scenario is illegal, the same groups of people advocate for things like NAFTA. This way, the small groups of people can put themsleves in a position where their only job is getting paid, while foreigners do the work. 3. This gets done by Contracting. So, here is the order: a. Company xyz hires and pays 100 American workers. b. 5 people form Contractor 123. c. These same people lobby for things like NAFTA. Then, they sign contracts with company xyz. Company xyz than lays off all 100 American workers, and hires the 5 people to do the same jobs. d. So, the 5 people collect the paychecks that the 100 American workers collected. AND immigrants who work for nothing do the work, while the 5 people get paid. I expose free trade for what it is, I think it is the legalization of the diversion of paychecks is all it is. Like I said, had it not been for NAFTA and free trade agreements, these same 5 people would be doing ID theft schemes, and diverting American workers paychecks into their own bank acounts. quote: Originally posted by crackerjacks61: Man this is scary.

Hey you can thank Pelosi....it is unAmerican to speak of hispanics like that...I'm assuming by the way that the person is Hispanic because it is Texas. I'm thinking you can thank Reagan, he was the President that granted amnesty. You might also thank the company management for putting profits above public safety (now there's a surprise). Yep, slam the companies. They need to be held responsible. We also need to get on the FAA for not keeping a better eye on testing facilities. As far as Reagan goes, the amnesty was very limited and also called for congress to appropriate funds for control of the borders IIRC. No one really supported the follow-up. That politicians would rather have the voting block versus controlling both legal and illegal immigration is why our borders are so porous. Illegal immigrants do not constitute a voting block, they do however constitute CHEAP LABOR!",

Plus, the workers would have a recourse: they can have their days in court. 2. NOW: since the above scenario is illegal, the same groups of people advocate for things like NAFTA. This way, the small groups of people can put themsleves in a position where their only job is getting paid, while foreigners do the work. 3. This gets done by Contracting. So, here is the order: a. Company xyz hires and pays 100 American workers. b. 5 people form Contractor 123. c. These same people lobby for things like NAFTA. Then, they sign contracts with company xyz. Company xyz than lays off all 100 American workers, and hires the 5 people to do the same jobs. d. So, the 5 people collect the paychecks that the 100 American workers collected. AND immigrants who work for nothing do the work, while the 5 people get paid. I expose free trade for what it is, I think it is the legalization of the diversion of paychecks is all it is.

There are lots of Hispanics in general that don't speak or read English. If it is broke they will fix it. It may be discriminatory to require that on a job description.

Plus, the workers would have a recourse: they can have their days in court. 2. NOW: since the above scenario is illegal, the same groups of people advocate for things like NAFTA. This way, the small groups of people can put themsleves in a position where their only job is getting paid, while foreigners do the work. 3. This gets done by Contracting. So, here is the order: a. Company xyz hires and pays 100 American workers. b. 5 people form Contractor 123. c. These same people lobby for things like NAFTA. Then, they sign contracts with company xyz. Company xyz than lays off all 100 American workers, and hires the 5 people to do the same jobs. d. So, the 5 people collect the paychecks that the 100 American workers collected. AND immigrants who work for nothing do the work, while the 5 people get paid. I expose free trade for what it is, I think it is the legalization of the diversion of paychecks is all it is. Like I said, had it not been for NAFTA and free trade agreements, these same 5 people would be doing ID theft schemes, and diverting American workers paychecks into their own bank acounts. quote: Originally posted by crackerjacks61: Man this is scary.
