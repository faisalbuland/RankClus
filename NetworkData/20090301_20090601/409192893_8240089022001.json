All this would be solved if he would just shut the border down finish the wall. Those weapons would still be bought if the 18% from the US dried up. Other countries seel weapons to mexico and buy their drugs. But Obama goes on stage and slams America again and sounded just like the Mehican Prez. Now, we have our President cowering under pressure from Mexico on all fronts. They threatened sanctions because we stopped their trucks from entering and now Obama is going to lift the ban. And his Adm is saying it's a 2 way street. Our trucks will have busy and can go south also. Problem is our trucks dont want to go to that shiithole and be robbed and murdered. The teamsters are against this and I find myself agreeing with them. Prrof was already posted that he never said that. If you've heard otherwise, feel free to post it. Good luck! Are you talking to me or IRS? as far as bans, he better inform the rest of his adm. Well see how he skirts around it like everything else. Next will be ammo. MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama says he prefers to focus on enforcing existing laws to keep assault weapons out of Mexico, rather than trying to renew a U.S. ban on the weapons.\" \"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gjfh3lr87qvFC6xE-GyllobR-UZwD97JQMD84\"", 
        "reply": " I heard him blame the US for most of the guns going into Mexico, and I can't remember but I sure he took this opportunity to put down our country again. If he says it's US fault then he justifies taking our weapons, not the ones that have them illegly of course. I am very dissapointed and concern for my country.",

As we both know and have agreed on, there are many issues in which I disagree with people on the right, as well. But, that would be because I am neither left wing, nor right wing. But, I do support the 2nd, I do support smaller government, I do support states rights and those of the people, I do support sound monetary policy, I do support lower taxation and no taxation on income, etc. These are the things that the left fears from people like myself. I have been called a republican many times in recent days by the liberals on this board because these are the issues in which I side with the republicans. But, it is plainly obvious that I am a Libertarian. I have been very consistent in my views and they are the views that form the basic platform of the Libertarian Party. It seems that the liberals forget that I also support views from the left. I am pro choice, I support legalizing marijuana (all drugs actually), I support the legalization of prostitution, I can care less if gay people want to get married, I support social freedom, I favor diplomacy over military solutions (noninterventionism), I support stem cell research, I do not support trade agreements, I support equal opportunity, I am against torture of any kind, I support people wanting to organize a union (I belong to four unions, myself), etc. But, my support of some of the things from the left does not seem to make up for the things that I support from the right. It is the changing of the tide, really. I was viewed as a liberal when conservatives were in charge. Now that liberals are in charge, I am viewed as a conservative. However, little me has been a Libertarian the whole time. It amazes me how ignorant some people really are. It just further supports my belief that most people truly are idiots. This memo really is irresponsible. It will further divide this country by doing two things. First, it will make the left more antagonistic toward those on the right. They will immediately label them a right wing extremist and as with most liberals, they will be pretty outspoken and blunt about that. The other thing it will do is make the right extremely po'd. And, no matter what political affiliation you have, getting people po'd is not a good idea because they tend to do stupid things when they a mad. So, I imagine that there will be some angry people who actually make themselves fit the description who would have otherwise not fit it before. I see bad things happening in the future. Not just from this report, but from a multitude of things that are happening right now. This is a crazy time and it will only get crazier.",
