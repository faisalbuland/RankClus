Obama is wrong to try to curry favor with these people, and they will regard it (as they ALREADY are regarding it) as an admission that it was the right thing to do. Dave President Bush admitted that there no WMDs were ever found in Iraq. Right before leaving office, President Bush said: \u201cYou know, not having weapons of mass destruction [in Iraq] was a significant disappointment.\u201d Jan 12, 2009 Commander in Chief Bush admitted that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But more than 20 percent of adults in American believe that there were. Almost as many believe that the WMDs were sent to Syria, with no more evidence than that Rush told them so. A truth commission would not change the mind of someone like GlassOnion who recently posted on another thread: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned they could cut their freaking fingers, hands, toes, and feet, off \u2013 one at a time until they bled to death. They should have run closed circuit TVs into each cell with the volume up loud while their buddies were getting their new customized manicures\u2026 Personally, I think that would have curtailed many from joining up \u2013 but apparently giving them unemployment checks and food stamps with green cards is what Obama thinks will work\u2026 I hope he keeps them at HIS HOUSE \u2013 or maybe Pelosi could let them rent her place for a while\u2026\u201d A truth commission would allow some to twist the truth some more. President Bush has often said that history will be his judge. It will. He will forever be known as the President who allowed torture on his watch.",

No matter WHAT Obama does, he's going to get unfair flack. Take Judge Bybee. This guys ready to admit that he did wrong. Look, there are things that happen that need more than sweeping under the rug. Until there is an admittance of guilt, there will be a large portion of Americans who will not acknowledge a damn thing. Having the perpetrators admit they were wrong, will cut this minority down to a fringe. Obama is wrong to try to curry favor with these people, and they will regard it (as they ALREADY are regarding it) as an admission that it was the right thing to do. Dave President Bush admitted that there no WMDs were ever found in Iraq. Right before leaving office, President Bush said: \u201cYou know, not having weapons of mass destruction [in Iraq] was a significant disappointment.\u201d Jan 12, 2009 Commander in Chief Bush admitted that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But more than 20 percent of adults in American believe that there were. Almost as many believe that the WMDs were sent to Syria, with no more evidence than that Rush told them so. A truth commission would not change the mind of someone like GlassOnion who recently posted on another thread: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned they could cut their freaking fingers, hands, toes, and feet, off \u2013 one at a time until they bled to death. They should have run closed circuit TVs into each cell with the volume up loud while their buddies were getting their new customized manicures\u2026 Personally, I think that would have curtailed many from joining up \u2013 but apparently giving them unemployment checks and food stamps with green cards is what Obama thinks will work\u2026 I hope he keeps them at HIS HOUSE \u2013 or maybe Pelosi could let them rent her place for a while\u2026\u201d A truth commission would allow some to twist the truth some more. President Bush has often said that history will be his judge. It will. He will forever be known as the President who allowed torture on his watch. Naw, I think President Bush will be known for keeping America safe and the only reason this witch hunt stopped is because of our illustrious SOTH Pelosi. She doesn't want to answer any questions on what she knew.",
