After David Wilkerson's prophetic words check out what other vision he had below it. (and what he did about it) \"AN EARTH-SHATTERING CALAMITY IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. IT IS GOING TO BE SO FRIGHTENING, WE ARE ALL GOING TO TREMBLE \u2013 EVEN THE GODLIEST AMONG US. For 10 years I have been warning about a thousand fires coming to New York City. It will engulf the whole megaplex, including areas of New Jersey and Connecticut. Major cities all across America will experience riots and blazing fires \u2013 such as we saw in Watts, Los Angeles, years ago. There will be riots and fires in cities worldwide. There will be looting \u2013 including Times Square, New York City. What we are experiencing now is not a recession, not even a depression. We are under God's wrath. In Psalm 11 it is written: \u2026 God is judging the raging sins of America and the nations. He is destroying the secular foundations. The prophet Jeremiah pleaded with wicked Israel, \"God is fashioning a calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh, turn back each of you from your evil way, and reform your ways and deeds. But they will say, It's hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart\" (Jeremiah 18:11-12). In Psalm 11:6, David warns, \"Upon the wicked he will rain snares (coals of fire) \u2026 fire \u2026 burning wind \u2026 will be the portion of their cup.\" Why? David answered, \"Because the Lord is righteous\" (v. 7). This is a righteous judgment \u2013 just as in the judgments of Sodom and in Noah's generation. WHAT SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS DO? WHAT ABOUT GOD'S PEOPLE? First, I give you a practical word I received for my own direction. If possible lay in store a 30-day supply of non-perishable food, toiletries and other essentials. In major cities, grocery stores are emptied in an hour at the sign of an impending disaster. \u2026 I will behold our Lord on his throne, with his eye of tender, loving kindness watching over every step I take \u2013 trusting that he will deliver his people even through floods, fires, calamities, tests, trials of all kinds. Note: I do not know when these things will come to pass, but I know it is not far off. I have unburdened my soul to you. Do with the message as you choose. Exceprted from Janet Porter: In the fall of 2001, Pastor David Wilkerson, of Times Square Church in New York City, was warned by God that a calamity was coming. For six weeks they felt an intense burden and enormous heaviness. A critical need for intercession was so profound that Pastor Wilkerson canceled everything on the church calendar \u2013 mission's conferences, youth events and every guest speaker. For six weeks, there wasn't a sermon. Instead, there was intercession for our nation with weeping and repentance. They knew something was coming and that something was bad. And that something was soon. So they prayed. And prayed \u2026 and prayed. Then Wilkerson felt God telling him something that seemed rather bizarre. He felt God telling him to make sandwiches \u2013 lots of sandwiches. What were they for? Who would eat them? That part wasn't clear, but his church did what they believed God was telling them anyway. And on the 10th of September they stayed up all night making hundreds and hundreds of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. By morning they had about 2,000 sandwiches. At 8:46 a.m. the first plane hit the World Trade Center and Times Square Church was ready to feed and minister to rescue workers and victims of our nation's worst attack. >>>>\"http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=91296\"<<<<<<",
