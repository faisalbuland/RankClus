        "content": "The challenge issued by a flight attendant during a recent commercial air flight seemed innocuous enough: Name just one of the five Medal of Honor recipients from the current engagements in Afghanistan or Iraq, and get a free drink coupon. But the passengers\u2019 response \u2013 more specifically, the inability of all but just one to respond \u2013 revealed how little the average American knows about its military heroes. Bombarded by superhero lore almost from birth, many Americans grow to revere fictional heroes as well as sports and celebrity icons. But silence descended over the cabin of a flight bound from Jacksonville, Fla., to Baltimore when the conversation turned to those who had earned the nation\u2019s highest honor for valor \u2013 even when a free cocktail hung in the balance. Dale Shelton, an Annapolis, Md., resident who served five years as a Navy intelligence specialist, was the only passenger to press the button over his seat to beckon the attendant. Shelton\u2019s response: Army Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith, the first Medal of Honor recipient in the global war on terror, and in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Smith received the highest military honor for valor posthumously on April 3, 2005, two years to the day after saving more than 100 soldiers in the battle for Baghdad\u2019s airport. His young son and widow accepted the award on his behalf during a solemn White House ceremony. This time, the attendant offered a second challenge: name an American Idol winner. The cabin lit up like a pinball machine as 43 passengers scrambled to push their attendant call button. Passengers named various Idol winners. \"He concluded his announcement with the question: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with our country when out of 150 passengers, only one can name a Medal of Honor recipient, but 43 can name an American Idol winner?\u2019\" Read the rest here: \"http://www.onemarinesview.com/one_marines_view/2009/03/who-are-americas-heroes.html\" This message has been edited.

Bombarded by superhero lore almost from birth, many Americans grow to revere fictional heroes as well as sports and celebrity icons. But silence descended over the cabin of a flight bound from Jacksonville, Fla., to Baltimore when the conversation turned to those who had earned the nation\u2019s highest honor for valor \u2013 even when a free cocktail hung in the balance. Dale Shelton, an Annapolis, Md., resident who served five years as a Navy intelligence specialist, was the only passenger to press the button over his seat to beckon the attendant. Shelton\u2019s response: Army Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith, the first Medal of Honor recipient in the global war on terror, and in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Smith received the highest military honor for valor posthumously on April 3, 2005, two years to the day after saving more than 100 soldiers in the battle for Baghdad\u2019s airport. His young son and widow accepted the award on his behalf during a solemn White House ceremony. This time, the attendant offered a second challenge: name an American Idol winner. The cabin lit up like a pinball machine as 43 passengers scrambled to push their attendant call button. Passengers named various Idol winners. \"He concluded his announcement with the question: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with our country when out of 150 passengers, only one can name a Medal of Honor recipient, but 43 can name an American Idol winner?\u2019\" Read the rest here: \"http://www.onemarinesview.com/one_marines_view/2009/03/who-are-americas-heroes.html\" This message has been edited.

This what happens when the military no longer comes from the broader cross-section of American society and service is longer a mandatory right of passage for young Americans. The all-volunteer force has segregated itself into a world of it's own. Small wonder why the \"outside world\" cares little about what goes on inside the military, or who the military heroes are.

This what happens when the military no longer comes from the broader cross-section of American society and service is longer a mandatory right of passage for young Americans. The all-volunteer force has segregated itself into a world of it's own. Small wonder why the \"outside world\" cares little about what goes on inside the military, or who the military heroes are. Only a small percentage of Americans serve or have served, or come into contact with anyone who has. The volunteer, professional military might be a more effective fighting force, but it's positive impact on the rest of society is vastly diminished.",
