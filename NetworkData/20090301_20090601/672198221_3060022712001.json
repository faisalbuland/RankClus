I have problems with this approach. There is a difference in saying that we will be happy to amnesty those who wish to rejoin the Afghan community, and defacto recognising the Taliban. As another poster asks, \"What is a moderate Taliban?\" Sure, spread the word, that if you surrender, we wont even treat you as a prisoner. All will be forgiven. Do this on a low key, don't include the leadership, etc, etc. Taliban ideology is a version of Islam that never existed. They are defacto quite comparable to the most extreme political ideology. There is absolutely nothing that they cannot justify, and have justified. I've consistantly posted that to combat the Taliban we have to place our primary support to the secular forces of Afghanistan - i.e. those who have a greater incentive to terminate the Taliban than we do. We simply have picked and we simply support the wrong people. Dope dealers, and Fundamentalist light. The first so corrupt, that they are only interested in making money, the other, will betray us in a flash. Dave",

I have problems with this approach. There is a difference in saying that we will be happy to amnesty those who wish to rejoin the Afghan community, and defacto recognising the Taliban.

Do this on a low key, don't include the leadership, etc, etc. Taliban ideology is a version of Islam that never existed. They are defacto quite comparable to the most extreme political ideology. There is absolutely nothing that they cannot justify, and have justified. I've consistantly posted that to combat the Taliban we have to place our primary support to the secular forces of Afghanistan - i.e. those who have a greater incentive to terminate the Taliban than we do. We simply have picked and we simply support the wrong people. Dope dealers, and Fundamentalist light.

There is absolutely nothing that they cannot justify, and have justified. I've consistantly posted that to combat the Taliban we have to place our primary support to the secular forces of Afghanistan - i.e. those who have a greater incentive to terminate the Taliban than we do.

The same thing happened with Somalis who came to the US now have sons return to fight against US interests and have made quite an enterprise in kidnapping and piracy with their knowledge learned in the US.
