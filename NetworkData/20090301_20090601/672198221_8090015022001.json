Both Miller and Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said no decisions have been made regarding charges against the lone surviving pirate. \"The Justice Department will be reviewing the evidence and other issues to determine whether to seek prosecution in the United States,\" Boyd said. Phillips was taken hostage after his cargo ship was attacked by pirates. The crew thwarted the hijacking but the pirates fled with Phillips into a lifeboat. Attorney General Eric Holder said this past week that the U.S. hasn't seen a case of piracy against an American ship in hundreds of years. U.S. prosecutors do have jurisdiction to bring charges when a crime is committed against a U.S. citizen or on a U.S. ship. Officials said the pirate surrendered to U.S. forces. Details of the surrender were not immediately unclear but, under international law, the Navy has the right to hold pirates captured at sea and does not need to negotiate extradition with another country. The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with Somalia. The FBI office in New York is running the investigation because it oversees cases involving U.S. citizens in Africa. The FBI investigates crimes committed on the high seas but piracy is unusual.

Pretty soon it will be to expensive to get war insurance quote: LONDON \u2013 Shipping your oil across the Gulf of Aden? Don't forget your piracy insurance. As a ragtag group of gunmen faced off for days against the U.S. Navy near the coast of Somalia before a cargo ship captain was freed Sunday, industry-watchers say shipping companies already smarting from the global downturn are forced to pony up extra cash for steeper premiums to cover multimillion dollar ransoms or take the long way around African continent in the hope of dodging hijackers. \"The pirates were the only people who had a good year in 2008,\" said Crispian Cuss, a security consultant with the Dubai-based Olive Group. The Gulf of Aden, which connects the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, is one of the busiest and most dangerous waterways in the world. As pirates have become more aggressive, the cost of insuring ships has gone up. Some companies are spending more time training their crews, others are avoiding the area altogether \u2014 taking long trips around the Africa's southern tip that can potentially add millions to the cost of each journey. While the coast of Somalia has been a problem for years, it was flagged in May as an area of particular concern by Lloyd's Market Association, and premiums have been rising \u2014 at least tenfold, according to some media reports. Neil Smith, the senior manager for underwriting for Lloyd's Market Association, has said the exact figures are commercially sensitive in a highly competitive industry. Large ships generally carry three separate types of insurance. Marine \u2014 or hull \u2014 insurance covers physical risks, such as grounding or damage from heavy seas. A second type of policy, protection and indemnity, covers crew issues, while war risk insurance covers acts of war, insurgency, and terrorism. Although war risk policies typically cover hijackings and piracy, insurers often charge extra for ships that venture into high risk areas such as the Gulf of Aden. Others, including Chicago-based Aon Corp. and London's International Security Solutions Ltd., have recently launched new plans specifically tailored to cover losses incurred by piracy \u2014 for example by including ransoms and cargo delays under the same policy. The other option available to ship operators, taking the long way around Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead of the short cut through the Suez Canal, is also expensive. >>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_price_of_piracy<< And finally for the mentally deranged when it comes to President Obama quote: WASHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama twice authorized the military to rescue a U.S. captain held by Somali pirates and whose life appeared to be at risk, administration official said hours after Sunday's rescue.

Both Miller and Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said no decisions have been made regarding charges against the lone surviving pirate. \"The Justice Department will be reviewing the evidence and other issues to determine whether to seek prosecution in the United States,\" Boyd said. Phillips was taken hostage after his cargo ship was attacked by pirates. The crew thwarted the hijacking but the pirates fled with Phillips into a lifeboat. Attorney General Eric Holder said this past week that the U.S. hasn't seen a case of piracy against an American ship in hundreds of years. U.S. prosecutors do have jurisdiction to bring charges when a crime is committed against a U.S. citizen or on a U.S. ship. Officials said the pirate surrendered to U.S. forces.

As a ragtag group of gunmen faced off for days against the U.S. Navy near the coast of Somalia before a cargo ship captain was freed Sunday, industry-watchers say shipping companies already smarting from the global downturn are forced to pony up extra cash for steeper premiums to cover multimillion dollar ransoms or take the long way around African continent in the hope of dodging hijackers. \"The pirates were the only people who had a good year in 2008,\" said Crispian Cuss, a security consultant with the Dubai-based Olive Group. The Gulf of Aden, which connects the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, is one of the busiest and most dangerous waterways in the world. As pirates have become more aggressive, the cost of insuring ships has gone up. Some companies are spending more time training their crews, others are avoiding the area altogether \u2014 taking long trips around the Africa's southern tip that can potentially add millions to the cost of each journey. While the coast of Somalia has been a problem for years, it was flagged in May as an area of particular concern by Lloyd's Market Association, and premiums have been rising \u2014 at least tenfold, according to some media reports. Neil Smith, the senior manager for underwriting for Lloyd's Market Association, has said the exact figures are commercially sensitive in a highly competitive industry. Large ships generally carry three separate types of insurance. Marine \u2014 or hull \u2014 insurance covers physical risks, such as grounding or damage from heavy seas. A second type of policy, protection and indemnity, covers crew issues, while war risk insurance covers acts of war, insurgency, and terrorism. Although war risk policies typically cover hijackings and piracy, insurers often charge extra for ships that venture into high risk areas such as the Gulf of Aden. Others, including Chicago-based Aon Corp. and London's International Security Solutions Ltd., have recently launched new plans specifically tailored to cover losses incurred by piracy \u2014 for example by including ransoms and cargo delays under the same policy. The other option available to ship operators, taking the long way around Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead of the short cut through the Suez Canal, is also expensive. >>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_price_of_piracy<< And finally for the mentally deranged when it comes to President Obama quote: WASHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama twice authorized the military to rescue a U.S. captain held by Somali pirates and whose life appeared to be at risk, administration official said hours after Sunday's rescue.
