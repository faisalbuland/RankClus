His was the Bonfires of the Vanities; the burning of all freethought. He was as far from a transcendentalist as you could possibly get. He detested anything but a strictly Christian, by-the-book, personally-held god.",

        "reply": " That made absolutely no sense. Savonarola was the friar who nearly put an end to the humanist movement of the late fifteenth/early sixteenth century. His was the Bonfires of the Vanities; the burning of all freethought. He was as far from a transcendentalist as you could possibly get. He detested anything but a strictly Christian, by-the-book, personally-held god.",

        "content": "Spinoza held basically the same beliefs. They killed Savonarola for them as a Naturist and heretic!! Simplicity of attire and the churches, doing away with pomp and circumstance, as well as doing good and living a \"good\" life were among his basic ideas. The point where he went bad was, once again, fusing religion with secular power which he of course promptly abused as the leader pro-tempore of the city he commanded after the French were the victors in war. After he descended from power the church persecuted, arrested and condemned him to death. He was tortured and wrote a confession, after which, he then wrote a missive beseaching God to forgive his human weakness for writing under the pressures of torture. That's just the bare bones of it. There is much more to study about the man and his life. I don't believe he was a Jansenist, as has been said in the past. He was far too complicated for such a simple dismissal as such. They both used the term \"nature's God\" a term most Christians still don't understand is NOT blasphemy. After all, according to our beliefs, (supposedly) God made everything including the laws of nature and science, so why is it wrong to call Him Nature's God?? They were more properly called deists, as you are no doubt, very aware! Go figure!! This message has been edited. Last edited by: tawodi, Sat 02 May 2009 07:36 AM",
