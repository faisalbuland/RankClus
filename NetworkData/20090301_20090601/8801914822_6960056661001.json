        "content": "There are probably hundreds of reasons why China will be most reluctant to start a war with the US -- short of our nuking one of their cities or something. For one thing, we owe them WAY too much money. I think they recently passed the Central Bank of Japan as our biggest foreign creditor. That they are buying American Treasury Bonds doesn't make them unique, of course. We owe money to lots of other nations. We are a debtor nation to MEXICO. However, I doubt that they would like to see the dollar tumble too dramatically. For another thing, we are their number one buyer of exports. I recently went through my wardrobe and found almost all my clothes made in Singapore, Thailand, and China. That doesn't count cheap pocket calculators, TV sets, and DVD players. All of that means more money flowing into China's economy, which is globalizing in a crabwise fashion. They take it seriously too. A number of crooked entrepreneurs now languish in Chinese jails and at least one has been executed. (The guy responsible for lead in toys.) Another thing is, given their recent economic boom, they simply have too much to lose. The Chinese have no history of colonization or imperialism -- including an arguable Tibet. They're given to internal wars and wars that are in defense of their borders. They ARE building up their military, especially their Navy, but since they started at a low level, it only makes sense. How would you like a nuclear-armed maniac like Kim Il Jong living on your doorstep? Or the world's only remaining superpower doing things like formally guaranteeing the sovereignty of Taiwan, as we did in 2001? But, not being completely nuts, they're unlikely to launch a horde of missiles our way, or ANY way without plenty of justification. A final point has little to do with war but I'll make it anway. China recently passed the USA as the world's number one polluter. It's largely because of two things. (1) There are a hell of a lot more Chinese than there are Americans. (2) The recent economic boom has moved the Chinese towards making the same mistakes the rest of us have made -- shifting, for instance, from using methane from the pig style to provide natural gas for home cooking (recycling at its best), to buying a gas stove. And the streets of cities like Shanghai, that used to be choked with bicycles, are now gridlocked with cars. (Chinese cars have much higher mileage standards than ours. That's one of the benefits of dictatorships.) In sum: We are in accord.",
