I didn't want to copy another members posts. (post 1) Some in Law Enforcement have been warning of increased activity and a need for vigilance in this area since the 90's. Many of whom have been ignored. The training in this area is far short of what it should be. Granted the typical officer on the street has such a wide range of responsibilities that staying up to date in all areas is difficult at best. The need for specialized officers to monitor radical activities needs to start at the local level. Resources shared by the Fed's down to that level will allow the local officers with local knowledge to recognize this activity and alert the Federal agencies. Too much turf claiming on one extreme and \"not my problem\" on the other. The lack of communications between federal and local authorities routinely hamstrings any effective response. (post 2) You are right the percentage is probably lower than estimates given. One thing I didn't notice in the report was that a trend among gangs/extremist groups and other criminal enterprises is to use the military to gain training. This has been going on for many years. Young fringe members are recruited to join the military before any affiliation is detected by back ground checks. They obtain training then take it back to where they came from. The reference to McVeigh is made but does not elaborate on the matter. This should not be considered a slight to the hugh majority of good U.S. service men and women. The military we take much pride in is being used. References to disgruntled former military personell to me is misleading. They were disgruntled before they were military. The danger lies in the use of military training against what we all stand for.",

U.S.M.C. 1985-1989 I haven't had a chance to read the entire report. I've read them before and have felt the same way about them then. It is very dificult to write a report that is approaching an indictment while attempting to remain as politcally correct as possible. They are almost always insulting to what in general terms would be simple disagreement with policy/government. As I mentioned before broad strokes cover too much. To specific leaves no room for variables. Extremists come from and go in all directions. Don't have an answer just an observation.",

The focus needs to be on the radicals that have plagued this county for years. Any attempt to paint a definition of a radical in the broad strokes necessary to make laws enforcable makes for broad interpretation. Such broad interpretaion will cause misinterpretation and improper prosecution. Yes that was the double talk that gets everyone in trouble. Unfortunately realism and common sense rarely prevails.",

My concern stems from the inference that the military breeds extremist. This is clearly not the case. The focus is backwards. The military is being used by extremists to thier end. The focus needs to be on the radicals that have plagued this county for years.

Ted Ayers wrote a memoir which has rightfully been criticised as self serving and dishonest. But he's not the only one who has written memoirs of events. Cathy Wilkerson, one of the two survivors of the Greewitch Village explosioon, has also written a memoir, and from beginning to end she denounces the weather underground as being an egotistical group of fanatics, lost in a fantasy world. She excuses nothing, least of all herself. Whatever else you want to say about them, plain and simple, they killed only one person, and that was done by people not part of their group. On another thread I made fun of Line Doggie for this story of the \"nail bomb,\" and Fort Dix, accusing him of \"making it up.\" My very bad!!! This story seems to be accepted wisdom all over the net. The story of the nail bomb and the dance seems to have slowly evolved over the years. Plain and simple Ms. Wilkerson matter of factly says that this was a pipe bomb meant to destroy the officers club at Fort Dix, when there was no one there. This fits in very well with their MO. They never targeted people. Never. So, terrorists of not. Stupid fanatics or not, they were not Timothy McVeighs who aimed their bombs at people. There is one group of people who hate the weather underground more than Rightists do - And that is other left wingers who felt that they were deliberately sabotaging the anti-war movement. Dave",

He was not right wing or left wing. He held no real political affiliation at all. But, he did hate liberals and socialists with a passion. However, the weathermen did so. The proof is in the nails. They were just too inept to accomplish mass destruction and death in the case that comes to mind, but that was their intent. They instead blew themselves up by accident. But, the bomb was intended for a NCO dance at Fort Dix. They have accomplished both mass destruction and death, just not in combination. And, who is that guy that belonged to this group? I believe he is a professor in Chi-town or somewhere thereabouts. And, he has a friend... A black guy I think... Man, I just cannot remember their names for the life of me.", 
        "reply": " Ted Ayers wrote a memoir which has rightfully been criticised as self serving and dishonest. But he's not the only one who has written memoirs of events. Cathy Wilkerson, one of the two survivors of the Greewitch Village explosioon, has also written a memoir, and from beginning to end she denounces the weather underground as being an egotistical group of fanatics, lost in a fantasy world. She excuses nothing, least of all herself. Whatever else you want to say about them, plain and simple, they killed only one person, and that was done by people not part of their group. On another thread I made fun of Line Doggie for this story of the \"nail bomb,\" and Fort Dix, accusing him of \"making it up.\" My very bad!!! This story seems to be accepted wisdom all over the net. The story of the nail bomb and the dance seems to have slowly evolved over the years. Plain and simple Ms. Wilkerson matter of factly says that this was a pipe bomb meant to destroy the officers club at Fort Dix, when there was no one there. This fits in very well with their MO. They never targeted people. Never. So, terrorists of not. Stupid fanatics or not, they were not Timothy McVeighs who aimed their bombs at people. There is one group of people who hate the weather underground more than Rightists do - And that is other left wingers who felt that they were deliberately sabotaging the anti-war movement. Dave",

        "reply": " The net is full of those advocating armed resistance to the \"imminent\" destruction of America. The net is full of those who are talkiing about a \"Constitutional Crisis\" due to a Muslim Kenyan sitting in the Oval Office. Quite right to point out that these lunatics are a fringe - (some of them have started threads like the above on THIS board) While a small minority, they're talk is more than inflamatory. I don't need a DHS report to see that some of these people are out and out dangerous. And they advocate violence if the \"Constitutional Crisis\" isn't recognised - \"recognised,\" meaning Obama being removed from office. Dave",
