The state law passed today, 37 to 9, had a few liberals in the mix, an amendment to place the Ten Commandments on the front entrance to the state capitol. The feds in D.C., along with the ACLU, said it would be a mistake. Hey this is a conservative state, based on Christian values...! Guess what..........We did it anyway. We recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal immigrants, and ship them back to where they came from, unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. Hope we didn't send any of them to your state. This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU, they said it would be a mistake. Guess what..........we did it anyway. Yesterday we passed a law to include DNA samples from any and all illegals to the Oklahoma database, for criminal investigative purposes. Pelosi said it was unconstitutional. Guess what........they did it anyway. Several weeks ago, we passed a law, declaring Oklahoma as a Sovereign state, not under the Federal Government directives. That, for your information, makes Oklahoma and Texas the only states to do so. Guess what.........More states are likely to follow. Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, both Carolina's, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, West Virginia, just to name a few. Should Mississippi act, so will Florida . Save your confederate money, it appears the South is about to rise up once again. The federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I'm sure that was a set back for the Kennedys and Ms Pelosi. Guess what..........they did it anyway. By the way, Obama does not like any of this. Guess what....who cares...they are doing it anyway. They ain't skeert of the liberal press..God bless 'em. I hope the rest of the country finds the balls to act before it's too late. Joe Nugent By the way from what i understand this was done June of last year.(2008) D.J. --",

Any thing like that in Oki-land... We've also thought about Texas for the same reasons. We want to support a state willing to hold true to American values and not the bs liberals.",

Where we come from \u2013 democrat \u2013 republican \u2013 conservative \u2013 liberal \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter much to us\u2026 Where we draw the LINE is respect \u2013 arrogance \u2013 etc\u2026 Joe Lieberman is what I\u2019d call a liberal \u2013 but he\u2019s also a man of integrity. I don\u2019t agree with his political views but he remained true to the country stood for integrity instead of the arrogant disgraceful liars like Pelosi, Reid, Schumer, Durbin, Kerry, etc\u2026 Paying almost 1000-bucks per month for property taxes is a little on the stupid side \u2013 unless it is a huge lot. We have 2.5 acres \u2013 though its waterfront on a creek off the Chesapeake Bay \u2013 raising our taxes from 3k to 10k is not where I want to retire. The hard part is giving up the water. In a few month we\u2019ll drop the crab pots off the side of the pier \u2013 and go out every evening and pull in some good size hard crabs\u2026 umm steam them puppies up with good ole Old Bay seasoning \u2013 man\u2026 Rock fish are starting to run now \u2013 trout, blue, flounder, hardheads, spot, puppy-drum\u2026 man, my honey and I used to fill up coolers full towards the end of summer so we could freeze them\u2026 Them and soft-crabs\u2026 When the tide is running in or out early in the morning or at dusk \u2013 GREAT DAY \u2013 man, the big fish just sit at the creeks waiting for the little fish to come in or go out with the tide \u2013 I\u2019ve pulled 26\u201d trout, 36\u201d rock, 22\u201d hardhead, 26\u201d puppy-drum.\u2026 the only thing better than that \u2013 my honey likes fishing more than I do\u2026 So, nope, taint running from nothing \u2013 just want to find a place where freaking state isn\u2019t addicted to leftist liberalism as is going on in DC. I\u2019d love to find 10-200 acres on the water \u2013 secluded \u2013 mountains or flat with trees\u2026 I even looked at one of those Titan Missile silos they are selling to convert into a residence. Ideally, we\u2019d love to find a big old abandoned commercial building on the water \u2013 don\u2019t care how big \u2013 an old school \u2013 of factory of some sort \u2013 so we could convert it. That would be dream for us\u2026 We tend to like the ugly stuff\u2026 We\u2019ll probably look in Virginia down by Norfolk or something \u2013 also North Carolina\u2026 We are only about 90 miles southeast of DC. We are down by Patuxent River Naval-Air Station. So, personally, I\u2019d like to move OUT of the TARGET zones for al Qaeda. Once the liberals get through bankrupting our country \u2013 selling off our military and dismantling our defenses \u2013 my bet is \u2013 we will get busted between now and in about 2 yrs.

        "reply": " Where we come from \u2013 democrat \u2013 republican \u2013 conservative \u2013 liberal \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter much to us\u2026 Where we draw the LINE is respect \u2013 arrogance \u2013 etc\u2026 Joe Lieberman is what I\u2019d call a liberal \u2013 but he\u2019s also a man of integrity. I don\u2019t agree with his political views but he remained true to the country stood for integrity instead of the arrogant disgraceful liars like Pelosi, Reid, Schumer, Durbin, Kerry, etc\u2026 Paying almost 1000-bucks per month for property taxes is a little on the stupid side \u2013 unless it is a huge lot. We have 2.5 acres \u2013 though its waterfront on a creek off the Chesapeake Bay \u2013 raising our taxes from 3k to 10k is not where I want to retire. The hard part is giving up the water. In a few month we\u2019ll drop the crab pots off the side of the pier \u2013 and go out every evening and pull in some good size hard crabs\u2026 umm steam them puppies up with good ole Old Bay seasoning \u2013 man\u2026 Rock fish are starting to run now \u2013 trout, blue, flounder, hardheads, spot, puppy-drum\u2026 man, my honey and I used to fill up coolers full towards the end of summer so we could freeze them\u2026 Them and soft-crabs\u2026 When the tide is running in or out early in the morning or at dusk \u2013 GREAT DAY \u2013 man, the big fish just sit at the creeks waiting for the little fish to come in or go out with the tide \u2013 I\u2019ve pulled 26\u201d trout, 36\u201d rock, 22\u201d hardhead, 26\u201d puppy-drum.\u2026 the only thing better than that \u2013 my honey likes fishing more than I do\u2026 So, nope, taint running from nothing \u2013 just want to find a place where freaking state isn\u2019t addicted to leftist liberalism as is going on in DC. I\u2019d love to find 10-200 acres on the water \u2013 secluded \u2013 mountains or flat with trees\u2026 I even looked at one of those Titan Missile silos they are selling to convert into a residence. Ideally, we\u2019d love to find a big old abandoned commercial building on the water \u2013 don\u2019t care how big \u2013 an old school \u2013 of factory of some sort \u2013 so we could convert it. That would be dream for us\u2026 We tend to like the ugly stuff\u2026 We\u2019ll probably look in Virginia down by Norfolk or something \u2013 also North Carolina\u2026 We are only about 90 miles southeast of DC. We are down by Patuxent River Naval-Air Station. So, personally, I\u2019d like to move OUT of the TARGET zones for al Qaeda. Once the liberals get through bankrupting our country \u2013 selling off our military and dismantling our defenses \u2013 my bet is \u2013 we will get busted between now and in about 2 yrs.

Ideally, we\u2019d love to find a big old abandoned commercial building on the water \u2013 don\u2019t care how big \u2013 an old school \u2013 of factory of some sort \u2013 so we could convert it. That would be dream for us\u2026 We tend to like the ugly stuff\u2026 We\u2019ll probably look in Virginia down by Norfolk or something \u2013 also North Carolina\u2026 We are only about 90 miles southeast of DC. We are down by Patuxent River Naval-Air Station. So, personally, I\u2019d like to move OUT of the TARGET zones for al Qaeda. Once the liberals get through bankrupting our country \u2013 selling off our military and dismantling our defenses \u2013 my bet is \u2013 we will get busted between now and in about 2 yrs. I certainly hope NOT \u2013 but at the rate these boneheads in DC are going \u2013 their 9/11 denial will be completed \u2013 filed in the history files. So, just when things are starting to fall apart because Obama has mortgaged everything to buy votes for the next election \u2013 those folks being laid-off now \u2013 will start running out of money about then. Their unemployment checks will stop \u2013 their 401ks will be depleted or vanished \u2013 no more state funding \u2013 and all that money promised to create jobs \u2013 well, most of that is ONLY for gov jobs \u2013 repairing roads, remodeling gov buildings, etc. Yep \u2013 so, hopefully I\u2019m wrong \u2013 but if NOT, I prefer to stay out of the way \u2013 and FAR away from the cities because I just don\u2019t think all those folks are going to like soup kitchens everyday\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m too paranoid \u2013 hopefully I am \u2013 but I want to get out while we can\u2026 I\u2019d love to find a big ole farm/commercial building in the mountains on a big ole private lake\u2026 Me and my honey will be in heaven\u2026 and hey, you\u2019re welcome to come by and hang out\u2026 All I need is a room for my stereo to have a place to maintain my sanity\u2026 Gots to have my music\u2026",

We recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal immigrants, and ship them back to where they came from, unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. Hope we didn't send any of them to your state. This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU, they said it would be a mistake. Guess what..........we did it anyway. Yesterday we passed a law to include DNA samples from any and all illegals to the Oklahoma database, for criminal investigative purposes. Pelosi said it was unconstitutional. Guess what........they did it anyway. Several weeks ago, we passed a law, declaring Oklahoma as a Sovereign state, not under the Federal Government directives. That, for your information, makes Oklahoma and Texas the only states to do so. Guess what.........More states are likely to follow. Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, both Carolina's, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, West Virginia, just to name a few. Should Mississippi act, so will Florida . Save your confederate money, it appears the South is about to rise up once again. The federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I'm sure that was a set back for the Kennedys and Ms Pelosi. Guess what..........they did it anyway. By the way, Obama does not like any of this. Guess what....who cares...they are doing it anyway. They ain't skeert of the liberal press..God bless 'em. I hope the rest of the country finds the balls to act before it's too late. Joe Nugent By the way from what i understand this was done June of last year.(2008) D.J. -- Last time I checked, it's the Supreme Court which is going to determine whether these laws are Constitutional or not.
