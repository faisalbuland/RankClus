Don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell. that is accepted. Oh my! If you truly don't wish to shower with a \"potential pedophile\" then I suggest that you stop showering with straight males. They are by far the largest group of pedophiles on the planet! Scary straight men! I suppose we should kick them all out since they could be potential pedophiles, eh? I certainly wouldn't want you to have to shower with any! Oh wait, that would mean we would have to kick YOU out too huh? Guess you're stuck with the potential pedophiles. Sorry. You don't wish to serve with homosexuals, then by all means, feel free to leave! It is YOUR problem. I can tell you that the vast majority of homosexuals do NOT look at other people in the shower, and it is the epitomy of arrogance on your part to assume that you are soooo gorgeous that they would bother to look at your little wankie. Truth is, we have been showering with the same sex for all of our lives. It isn't a thrill. Sorry to break it to ya, but it really isn't. <yawn>. Why on earth would you be afraid to stick your child in a box with a homosexual? It doesn't rub off, and statistically speaking, they would be much safer since the vast majority of pedophiles are straight men. That is just a stupid unfounded fear on your part. Once again, if you are afraid of going to the gym, that is YOUR problem. Homosexuals have been around you your whole life, and oooh look...you are still unmolested. Wonder what that means? It means that homosexuals are just like the rest of society. We control our emotions and sexual drive just like everyone else, and in some cases, much better than heterosexuals since you seem to think that you guys would have a problem showering with females. As for it being a choice, it NEVER was. You are born the way you are born, and nothing is going to change that! If you had to serve by the same standards as DA/DT, you'd be the first to stamp your feet and scream \"Its not fair! I want my gf, or wife, etc. to be able to see me off, kiss me when I get back from deployment, I want to have a picture of her with me, I want to be able to have sex in the privacy of my own home without being discharged for it, etc.\" DA/DT is nothing but forced lying. You don't mind serving with homosexuals as long as they are forced to lie to you. You want to live in a little pretend world. There are people who can help you with this problem of yours. Seek them out in the mental health area...really, you will feel much better. Good luck with your problems. I hope you are able to overcome your fears of homosexuals. It is sad that your worst fear isn't being killed by the enemy, but of serving along side a homosexual. Really sad.",

Don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell. that is accepted. I did some of your homework for you: In 1978 psychologist Nicholas Groth screened 175 men who had been convicted in Massachusetts of sexual molestation of children and referred by a court for psychological evaluation. He found not a single gay man in this sample. Every one of the perpetrators was either an exclusive heterosexual, a bisexual with a predominantly heterosexual orientation, or a fixated pedophile with no sexual interest in adults.<4> His conclusion? That \"the adult heterosexual male constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male.\" In the same year, researcher David Newton reviewed the scientific literature and found no reason to believe that anything other than a \"random connection\" existed between homosexual orientation and child molestation.<5> In 1988, renowned sex researcher Kurt Freund at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto studied two groups of paid volunteers and found that gay men responded no more to male child stimuli than heterosexual men responded to female child stimuli.<6> He later described as a \"myth\" the notion that gay men are more likely than straight men to be child molesters.<7> The key to understanding research on this issue is to recognize three things. First, a person's sexual attraction to adults, whether homosexual, heterosexual, or bisexual, is wholly distinct from an attraction to children. A person can be attracted only to adults, only to children, or occasionally to both, but these attractions are independent facets of a person's psychology. Myth #2 - Most sexual abuse of boys is perpetrated by homosexual males.Pedophiles who molest boys are not expressing a homosexual orientation any more than pedophiles who molest girls are practicing heterosexual behaviors. While many child molesters have gender and/or age preferences, of those who seek out boys, the vast majority are not homosexual. They are pedophiles. Ok, now you have the facts so you can feel at ease. 99% of pedophiles are self identifying heterosexual white males. Feel better? I do.",
