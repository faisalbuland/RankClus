It all looks good on paper the way its set up in dollar values which shows the elite paying millions in taxes while the middle class only pay thousands and the poor pay hundreds or nothing. Convert that to percentage values and add the perks of write offs and tax free expense accounts and its clear to see the wealthy do not pay thier fair share.
