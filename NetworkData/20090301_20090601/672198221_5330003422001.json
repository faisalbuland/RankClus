Are you for or against international law? If you are for it, then you should be critical of these test since they violate UN laws. What UN law? Also, seriously? Now all of the sudden we are concerned with UN laws? I guess only when others (not part of the exclusive club) break it. I am all for getting out of the UN, I find it useless, but there are many on here that quote them as THE LAW of the land. That was the reason I asked the question. The UN has Resolutions on them now against missle testing of ANY sort. They violated that resolution and will keep doing it until something bad happens. Which may not be long off. I don\u2019t support getting out of UN, but we either abide by all international laws/resolutions or none at all! We can\u2019t cite one resolution as a cause for war, while at the same time breaking another one\u2026\u2026. Oh I agree with you there, but even before Obama took office our Government has been doing JUST that with the UN. Either Enforce the resolution or don't bother. That;s what makes the UN impotent.

Those sanctions mean absolutely nothing when you need so called 'international support' to act on anything than speaking out against it. But even then, many within the international community ignore the sanctions and continue to support those leaders anyway.. People want to stick their heads in the sand and believe they are bluffing--but I doubt they are. They can call on Iran, Russia, Venezuela and many others to side with them..",
