Right now, New York doesn't have quite enough support to pass Same-Sex marriage, but with a little additional bolstering by another State's acceptance of Gay Marriage, the New York State House & Senate may feel more comfortable voting with a \"Yes\". Whether it's New York, New Hampshire or New Jersey,,, all three will be won or lost by narrow margins. It's enough to rack the nerves of even the calmest LGBT supporters!!!",

And many are raising children. We fit the description of \"married couples\" in every sense of the word, yet many people refuse to accept our relationships as being worthy of such recognition. We are already living as married couples which no religious or social entity can prevent in this country. The only thing they can do is keep us from having the same benefits of marriage that the government freely gives to THEM. It reminds me of spoiled children who don't want to share with others. I'm curious. If our secular society removed any and all benefits extended to traditionally married couples and made it so that no benefits accrued to being married, would those currently wishing non-traditional 'marriage' still want it? It's beyond understanding how churches professing belief in the Bible can sanction gay 'marriage.' Since the Bible clearly defines h o m o s e x u a l conduct as sin, how can a church give the OK to sin? Okay, how can I put this in simple, easy-to-understand terms for you? WE'RE NOT ALL CHRISTIAN. I don't care what your Bible says. And even if I did, seeing as there are over 600 denominations of Christians worldwide, each with slightly different interpretations of the same freakin' book, clearly not everyone picks up the same message when they read it. I belong to a Unitarian Universalist church. My church recognizes gay marriage, and has for almost 30 years. We were married by an ordained minister. We don't need your church to recognize our marriage. If we cared what your church thought, we might have joined it. But we didn't. And as for Christian churches that honor gay marriages... you need to drop this \"one man, one woman; always has been, always will be\" delusion. In fact, even Christian churches performed marriage ceremonies for gay couples back up to 600 years ago. If there were no legal benefits attributed to LEGAL/CIVIL marriage, then I would still be married within my church because my commitment to my wife is a commitment that I make in clear view of the community, my family, and my friends. We're not \"shacking up.\" We're combining and intertwining our lives together, and we wish to declare this, just as anyone else would. The benefits are important to establishing our families and having our families protected in cases of inheritance, ownership, and more. And you know perfectly well that if the legal benefits of marriage were revoked across the board, heterosexual couples would have a snit-fit.",

I despise this attitude your type pushes, acting as if those who have different beliefs are \"non-believers,\" and therefore second-class. And why would you not talk to me about an issue that effects AMERICANS? I'm an American, born in the birthplace of the American Revolution, served my country in uniform, and continue to serve in other ways. You need to get over this idea that Christians have some sort of legal supremacy here, and speak about legal issues that impact all Americans without resorting to the attitude of religious superiority. Civil marriage is a LEGAL issue. My church will already perform a marriage ceremony for me. Finding religions and ordained ministers that will honor gay relationships is not difficult. What I want is a legal document to protect my family. quote: However, curiousity compells me to ask why your partner is a wife and not a husband? Not the brightest bulb in the box, huh? You assumed that I was a gay man, didn't you? See, that's yet another strange problem associated with the anti-gay religious right. They love to invoke the image of the flamboyant, effeminate, drug-using, club-going, glitter-covered young men. So when someone says they're not heterosexual, you automatically seem to assume gay men. That's because while Leviticus talks about men who lie with men (right after several chapters on how to perform proper animal sacrifices), you guys don't have any real religious ammunition to use against lesbians, other than your Old Testament assertion that men should control the women. quote: I'll be interested in comment from any who profess belief in the Bible, if there are any here. You missed the point. It DOES NOT MATTER. This isn't about your church, or any church. This issue is about a legal contract between two adults. If a church doesn't want to marry any couple (for ANY reason), they don't have to. Your minister can even refuse to marry a biracial couple, if you want. It's a church - it can do whatever it wants. The LAW, however, should never be bound by the whims of ANY religion - not yours, not mine, not anyone's. It should be based on the fair and impartial granting of protections and rights to all American citizens.",

        "reply": " You just keep piling insults on top of insults. I don't agree with your religion; that does not make me a non-believer. I despise this attitude your type pushes, acting as if those who have different beliefs are \"non-believers,\" and therefore second-class. And why would you not talk to me about an issue that effects AMERICANS? I'm an American, born in the birthplace of the American Revolution, served my country in uniform, and continue to serve in other ways. You need to get over this idea that Christians have some sort of legal supremacy here, and speak about legal issues that impact all Americans without resorting to the attitude of religious superiority. Civil marriage is a LEGAL issue. My church will already perform a marriage ceremony for me. Finding religions and ordained ministers that will honor gay relationships is not difficult. What I want is a legal document to protect my family. quote: However, curiousity compells me to ask why your partner is a wife and not a husband? Not the brightest bulb in the box, huh? You assumed that I was a gay man, didn't you? See, that's yet another strange problem associated with the anti-gay religious right.

Paterson Rankles Religious Leaders New York governor David Paterson irritated some religious leaders on Tuesday with comments insinuating that their opposition to marriage equality is driven by guilt, according to the Associated Press. \"The fact is that for years these same individuals ... not all of them, but many of them, who pronounce religious doctrine did not exercise it when young gay and lesbian students were being bullied and chastised for expressing their points of view,\" said Paterson. \"Where were these leaders of faith when college students of gay and lesbian orientation were beaten and often brutalized for expressing their feelings to each other?\" he asked, referring to efforts to get inclusive hate-crimes legislation passed in 2000. Paterson made the comments during a gay rights lobby day that drew thousands of advocates to Albany, the state capital. Although the governor did not specify any religious denominations, the New York State Catholic Conference responded harshly, calling his comments insulting and harmful.
