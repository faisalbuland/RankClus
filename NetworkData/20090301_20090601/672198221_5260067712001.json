We all know how that turned out. I have no doubt that the BVR capabilities of the F 35 are outstanding, but I also have no doubt that aircraft will be meeting in the merge for some time into the future. to give up that capability seems to me to be \"We don't need no stinking guns\", redoux.",

The Euro has been seen flying the skies of Florida with American markings. I remember when it first flew Europe was saying it was a copy of the Super Hornet and questioned if it should be built. Su-35 flies higher, faster than it predessesors, carries a much higher fuel and armament load, but sucks (literally) on mpgallon at low attitudes. All very impressive to me.",

Bullets will be a ancient technology. Like sling shots and rocks. It will happen within the next 12-15 years if Obama doesnt cut funding but OTOH, only a few smart people know exactly where and how funding is done on some of the best black technology which hopefully will stay safe from Obama's budget scalpel. One of the biggest reasons to build another 180-200 F-22s is because of it already being able to be upgraded for this type of weapon although its first applications will be aboard the B-1B. abandoning the F-35 and redirecting the funding to more F-22s makes more sense now from a economic perspective as the F-35 is already at 80 million each and the F-22 is still under 140 million and could drop to 110 million each with a doubling of the total order. Simply more bang for the buck. Anything the F-35 will be able to do the F-22 will always be able to do it better with simple programming modifications and a bigger internal weapons capability. I can also drop my once favored opinion of buying more F-15s as the latest delivery price is just over 70 million. 40 million for the incredible extra bang for the buck? yeah, might as well of we can pay for everyones healthcare and mortgage might as well spend it on something that could prove itself in defense of the country instead of dumping it on aid for those who refuse to work and illegals and getting only chit(Literally) back for the money spent? The F-18 Super Hornet is a mature program and is being used successfully in a variety of roles as its achieving its developmental potential. designed reductions in RCS, proposed RAC coatings (still problematic in the Naval environment) and deployment of AESA radar along with possible future engine upgrades will keep this aircraft formidable through 2020-2025 when a better replacement is hopefully available and perhaps fully automated.",
