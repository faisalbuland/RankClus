The Social Security Administration is sending out $250 payments to more than 50 million retirees in May as part of the economic stimulus package. The payments will go to people who receive Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, railroad retirement benefits or veteran's disability benefits. The payments are meant to provide a boost for people who don't qualify for the tax credit. However, they will go to retirees even if they have earned income and receive the credit. Those retirees will have the $250 payment deducted from their tax credit -- but not until they file their tax returns next year, long after the money may have been spent. Retirees who have federal income taxes withheld from pension benefits also are getting an income boost as a result of the new withholding tables. However, pension benefits are not earned income, so they don't qualify for the tax credit. That money will have to paid back next year when tax returns are filed. More than 20 million retirees and survivors receive payments from defined benefit pension plans, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. However, it is unclear how many have federal taxes withheld from their payments. I've posted this link before on another thread, but I can't find it at the moment..if you haven't checked the calculations you might want to, to make sure your not going to end up paying way more in taxes come April of next year.. http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96196,00.html",

Exactly, and if you are receiving retirement income, which they take taxes out of, and have adjusted to take out the 'making work pay' taxes, and if you have another income, which is also taking out taxes at the new 'lower rate' then your having double the money taken out.. and if your married and your spouse also works, they are taking out triple the amount.. So if your married the so called tax credit is $800, if your single it's $400. So if your married and both you and your spouse work the military takes out the $800 from your retirement check, your current employer takes out another $800, and your spouses employer takes out another $800, your over the tax credit by $1600; that the government will want back..",
