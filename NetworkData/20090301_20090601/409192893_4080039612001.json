It\u2019s like\u2026 it\u2019s like a tick, I mean sometimes I hear myself say something and then I think, wow, that wasn\u2019t even remotely true,\u201d she explains to lucky soon-to-be-boyfriend Zach Braff. Five years later, Sam would be working for Obama. Why? Because she lies and since she\u2019s cute and charismatic, no one cares. What a perfect spokeswoman for the Obama administration. They lie with reckless abandon. But Obama flashes his trademark smile and no one notices \u2013- especially the media. You won\u2019t hear about the lying on ABC, CBS or NBC. Or read it in The Washington Post or New York Times either. Last year, the news media threw considerable influence behind President Pinocchio. Now journalism is in such financial distress, they\u2019d be hard-pressed to fact check his cereal box. Besides it\u2019s a sin of Washington etiquette to call a deliberate political misstatements \u201clies.\u201d Only the uncouth call them actual lies. We are one month in to a marathon game of liar\u2019s poker and the American public is playing the losing hand. It\u2019s not as if the Obama folks are stupid. They aren\u2019t. They aren\u2019t even compulsive or pathological. They are simply of a breed apart from ordinary humans \u2014 they\u2019re politicians. And it\u2019s funny because that was the one thing they claimed they weren\u2019t. The one big \u201cchange\u201d from previous Washington creatures. But it\u2019s no change at all. They lie about Iraq. They lie about guns. They lie about the economy. They lie about the size of government. Then they lie about lying. Welcome to the Pinocchio administration : Obama is the only one pulling strings on the media. The rest of us in the audience watch fascinated. You won\u2019t hear about the lying on ABC, CBS or NBC. Or read it in The Washington Post or New York Times either. Last year, the news media threw considerable influence behind President Pinocchio. Now journalism is in such financial distress, they\u2019d be hard-pressed to fact check his cereal box. Besides it\u2019s a sin of Washington etiquette to call a deliberate political misstatements \u201clies.\u201d Only the uncouth call them actual lies. Remember the Barack Obama who proposed pulling our troops out of Iraq by the end of 2008? \u201cThe days of our open-ended commitment must come to a close,\u201d he told the Senate, according to a Jan. 31, 2007, Washington Post article. Now, according to the Associated Press, the open-ended commitment has been replaced with \u201cas many as 50,000 troops to remain behind to train Iraqi forces and protect U.S. interests.\u201d Even anti-war lefties think he lied. They are right \u2013- for once. Remember that guy Obama who supported gun rights? He\u2019s just a faint memory. A year ago, in an interview with Politico, Obama was reminded that supported gun ownership: \u201cYou said recently, \u2018I have no intention of taking away folks\u2019 guns.\u2019 But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you\u2019ve said that it\u2019s constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?\u201d Even then he hemmed and hawed, concluding: \u201cWe can have a reasonable, thoughtful gun control measure that I think respects the Second Amendment and people\u2019s traditions.\u201d \u201cReasonable, thoughtful\u201d are words unknown to Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder already has tried to link the Mexican narco-wars to U.S. gun sales and go after supposed \u201cassault weapons.\u201d Obama\u2019s record on government and the economy is actually worse. He and his surrogates keep maintaining that his budget won\u2019t hurt the pockets of 95 percent of Americans who will get a tax cut. They lie. The lead editorial in the Feb. 27 Wall Street Journal showed by just how much. Using 2006 tax records, The Wall Street Journal showed how a tax hike won\u2019t begin to pay the 2010 budget of the $4 trillion. Even if the government were to confiscate (aka steal) every penny made by those who earn $250,000 and above, it would only meet one-third of the goal. To pay for that whole $4 trillion budget, the government would have to pilfer \u201cevery taxable \u2018dime\u2019 of everyone earning more than $75,000.\u201d That would just barely meet the goal, but those are 2006 numbers when the economy was good. In 2010, we\u2019d need to go even lower. A tax cut for 95 percent? Not hardly. The government will give money with one hand and take it back and loads more with the other \u2013- lying to us the whole time. ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos summed it up well during his March 1 \u201cThis Week\u201d show when, with a slip of the tongue, he referred to the omnibus spending bill as \u201comni-nous spending\u201d \u2013- an appropriate cross between omnibus and ominous spending. No kidding. It takes accidental phrasing to get honesty from the mainstream press \u2013 especially someone like Stephanopoulos who burns his cell phone minutes strategizing with his long-time Democratic buddies like James Carville, Paul Begala and Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. The rest of the time, we get precious little information from the press about how we\u2019ll pay through the nose and every other orifice. Instead, it\u2019s just reheated talking points about 95 percent of us getting tax cuts.

It is redistribution of wealth, right from the tool bag of SOCIALISM. Right this minute and for the rest of this generation and at least two generations or more out, the bill for the current spending will continue to be paid for. We have put our future generations into financial slavery. As we write our comments and send our letters and make our phone calls, taxes are being raised on every aspect of our lives that will require EVERY AMERICAN TAXPAYER to pay higher taxes; including the \"non-tax paying\" people. Under Bush and the tax cuts he enacted, the economy grew and our country was able to slug through 9/11 and several major disasters and fight conflicts in two separate areas, as well as send money to other countries to help them with their problems. Our economy was stable. In 2006, the Democrats got control of Congress and for some reason, Bush caught the spending disease and the economy started to waver. We, the people, were told that all was well and that a little belt tightening was all we needed. What really happened was, we were blatantly lied to and not by Bush. We were hoodwinked by the Democrats. Democrats such as Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters and numerous others. They lied to us about the sub-prime lending institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they told America that there was no problem and that these areas were solvent. They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers. To see how much of a lie this was, peruse an article at American Thinker. Go to their website, go to archives and find an article dated March 26th on how our economy became so screwed up. It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders. Now, we have a party-hack-of-a-President spending huge amounts of money and threatening tax increases that is driving our economy further into the toilet. Tax increases at this juncture in our economic crisis is irresponsible and dangerous for America. There are many new taxes on the horizon for energy production, equipment and material production, and the transportation and distribution of all of these. There are also going to be taxes on the services we need and use everyday; taxes that will hit EVERYONE in the wallet. We sure got change we can believe in and we are going to have to \"BELIEVE\" it for four long years. No country, state or municipality ever taxed itself into prosperity; just into decline. What does our future hold?",

We, the people, were told that all was well and that a little belt tightening was all we needed. What really happened was, we were blatantly lied to and not by Bush. We were hoodwinked by the Democrats. Democrats such as Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters and numerous others. They lied to us about the sub-prime lending institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they told America that there was no problem and that these areas were solvent. They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers. To see how much of a lie this was, peruse an article at American Thinker. Go to their website, go to archives and find an article dated March 26th on how our economy became so screwed up. It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders. Now, we have a party-hack-of-a-President spending huge amounts of money and threatening tax increases that is driving our economy further into the toilet. Tax increases at this juncture in our economic crisis is irresponsible and dangerous for America. There are many new taxes on the horizon for energy production, equipment and material production, and the transportation and distribution of all of these. There are also going to be taxes on the services we need and use everyday; taxes that will hit EVERYONE in the wallet. We sure got change we can believe in and we are going to have to \"BELIEVE\" it for four long years. No country, state or municipality ever taxed itself into prosperity; just into decline. What does our future hold?",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Anchorman7275: It would be nice if just the top 2% of the population could pay for all of the spending that is going on, but it can't and besides, it isn't fair either. It is redistribution of wealth, right from the tool bag of SOCIALISM. Right this minute and for the rest of this generation and at least two generations or more out, the bill for the current spending will continue to be paid for. We have put our future generations into financial slavery. As we write our comments and send our letters and make our phone calls, taxes are being raised on every aspect of our lives that will require EVERY AMERICAN TAXPAYER to pay higher taxes; including the \"non-tax paying\" people. Under Bush and the tax cuts he enacted, the economy grew and our country was able to slug through 9/11 and several major disasters and fight conflicts in two separate areas, as well as send money to other countries to help them with their problems. Our economy was stable. In 2006, the Democrats got control of Congress and for some reason, Bush caught the spending disease and the economy started to waver. We, the people, were told that all was well and that a little belt tightening was all we needed. What really happened was, we were blatantly lied to and not by Bush. We were hoodwinked by the Democrats. Democrats such as Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters and numerous others. They lied to us about the sub-prime lending institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they told America that there was no problem and that these areas were solvent. They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers. To see how much of a lie this was, peruse an article at American Thinker. Go to their website, go to archives and find an article dated March 26th on how our economy became so screwed up. It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders. Now, we have a party-hack-of-a-President spending huge amounts of money and threatening tax increases that is driving our economy further into the toilet.

Remember the Barack Obama who proposed pulling our troops out of Iraq by the end of 2008? \u201cThe days of our open-ended commitment must come to a close,\u201d he told the Senate, according to a Jan. 31, 2007, Washington Post article. Now, according to the Associated Press, the open-ended commitment has been replaced with \u201cas many as 50,000 troops to remain behind to train Iraqi forces and protect U.S. interests.\u201d Even anti-war lefties think he lied. They are right \u2013- for once. Remember that guy Obama who supported gun rights? He\u2019s just a faint memory. A year ago, in an interview with Politico, Obama was reminded that supported gun ownership: \u201cYou said recently, \u2018I have no intention of taking away folks\u2019 guns.\u2019 But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you\u2019ve said that it\u2019s constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?\u201d Even then he hemmed and hawed, concluding: \u201cWe can have a reasonable, thoughtful gun control measure that I think respects the Second Amendment and people\u2019s traditions.\u201d \u201cReasonable, thoughtful\u201d are words unknown to Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder already has tried to link the Mexican narco-wars to U.S. gun sales and go after supposed \u201cassault weapons.\u201d Obama\u2019s record on government and the economy is actually worse. He and his surrogates keep maintaining that his budget won\u2019t hurt the pockets of 95 percent of Americans who will get a tax cut. They lie. The lead editorial in the Feb. 27 Wall Street Journal showed by just how much. Using 2006 tax records, The Wall Street Journal showed how a tax hike won\u2019t begin to pay the 2010 budget of the $4 trillion. Even if the government were to confiscate (aka steal) every penny made by those who earn $250,000 and above, it would only meet one-third of the goal. To pay for that whole $4 trillion budget, the government would have to pilfer \u201cevery taxable \u2018dime\u2019 of everyone earning more than $75,000.\u201d That would just barely meet the goal, but those are 2006 numbers when the economy was good. In 2010, we\u2019d need to go even lower. A tax cut for 95 percent? Not hardly. The government will give money with one hand and take it back and loads more with the other \u2013- lying to us the whole time. ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos summed it up well during his March 1 \u201cThis Week\u201d show when, with a slip of the tongue, he referred to the omnibus spending bill as \u201comni-nous spending\u201d \u2013- an appropriate cross between omnibus and ominous spending. No kidding. It takes accidental phrasing to get honesty from the mainstream press \u2013 especially someone like Stephanopoulos who burns his cell phone minutes strategizing with his long-time Democratic buddies like James Carville, Paul Begala and Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. The rest of the time, we get precious little information from the press about how we\u2019ll pay through the nose and every other orifice.

Our economy was stable. In 2006, the Democrats got control of Congress and for some reason, Bush caught the spending disease and the economy started to waver. We, the people, were told that all was well and that a little belt tightening was all we needed. What really happened was, we were blatantly lied to and not by Bush. We were hoodwinked by the Democrats. Democrats such as Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters and numerous others. They lied to us about the sub-prime lending institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they told America that there was no problem and that these areas were solvent. They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers.

It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders. Now, we have a party-hack-of-a-President spending huge amounts of money and threatening tax increases that is driving our economy further into the toilet. Tax increases at this juncture in our economic crisis is irresponsible and dangerous for America. There are many new taxes on the horizon for energy production, equipment and material production, and the transportation and distribution of all of these. There are also going to be taxes on the services we need and use everyday; taxes that will hit EVERYONE in the wallet. We sure got change we can believe in and we are going to have to \"BELIEVE\" it for four long years. No country, state or municipality ever taxed itself into prosperity; just into decline.

What does our future hold? COMMENT: This type of misdirected \"partisan blame\" is precisely the reason why we find ourselves saddled with such a economic catastrophe, and why the general frustration with government inaction and inefficiency continues. This perpetuates the needless \"finger-pointing\" and the \"blame game.\" If one feels so smugly self-righteous politically, then we'll certainly continue an increasing level of public dissatisfaction and failing confidence in our government at all levels to be a boon to our way of life rather than intrusive and burdensome. Given the huge, record deficits eagerly accepted during the last administration, without increased tax revenues, there is no opportunity to move out of this economic abyss otherwise. No one is happy about the prospect of increased taxation; it's generally counterproductive and exponentially hurts those in the middle class the most. But tax cuts for the wealthy do not work, especially now, and the \"trickle down\" theory of prosperity has been credited and certainly has no credibility in this type of economic environment. So many are so critical about this administration in its less than 60 days of performance. It's this very type of parochial divisiveness that helped create this mess, and that will exacerbate its intensity.",

They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers. To see how much of a lie this was, peruse an article at American Thinker. Go to their website, go to archives and find an article dated March 26th on how our economy became so screwed up. It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders. Now, we have a party-hack-of-a-President spending huge amounts of money and threatening tax increases that is driving our economy further into the toilet. Tax increases at this juncture in our economic crisis is irresponsible and dangerous for America. There are many new taxes on the horizon for energy production, equipment and material production, and the transportation and distribution of all of these. There are also going to be taxes on the services we need and use everyday; taxes that will hit EVERYONE in the wallet. We sure got change we can believe in and we are going to have to \"BELIEVE\" it for four long years. No country, state or municipality ever taxed itself into prosperity; just into decline. What does our future hold?", 
        "reply": " COMMENT: This type of misdirected \"partisan blame\" is precisely the reason why we find ourselves saddled with such a economic catastrophe, and why the general frustration with government inaction and inefficiency continues. This perpetuates the needless \"finger-pointing\" and the \"blame game.\" If one feels so smugly self-righteous politically, then we'll certainly continue an increasing level of public dissatisfaction and failing confidence in our government at all levels to be a boon to our way of life rather than intrusive and burdensome.

It\u2019s like\u2026 it\u2019s like a tick, I mean sometimes I hear myself say something and then I think, wow, that wasn\u2019t even remotely true,\u201d she explains to lucky soon-to-be-boyfriend Zach Braff. Five years later, Sam would be working for Obama. Why? Because she lies and since she\u2019s cute and charismatic, no one cares. What a perfect spokeswoman for the Obama administration. They lie with reckless abandon. But Obama flashes his trademark smile and no one notices \u2013- especially the media. You won\u2019t hear about the lying on ABC, CBS or NBC. Or read it in The Washington Post or New York Times either. Last year, the news media threw considerable influence behind President Pinocchio. Now journalism is in such financial distress, they\u2019d be hard-pressed to fact check his cereal box.

We are one month in to a marathon game of liar\u2019s poker and the American public is playing the losing hand. It\u2019s not as if the Obama folks are stupid. They aren\u2019t. They aren\u2019t even compulsive or pathological. They are simply of a breed apart from ordinary humans \u2014 they\u2019re politicians. And it\u2019s funny because that was the one thing they claimed they weren\u2019t. The one big \u201cchange\u201d from previous Washington creatures. But it\u2019s no change at all. They lie about Iraq. They lie about guns. They lie about the economy. They lie about the size of government. Then they lie about lying. Welcome to the Pinocchio administration : Obama is the only one pulling strings on the media. The rest of us in the audience watch fascinated. You won\u2019t hear about the lying on ABC, CBS or NBC. Or read it in The Washington Post or New York Times either. Last year, the news media threw considerable influence behind President Pinocchio. Now journalism is in such financial distress, they\u2019d be hard-pressed to fact check his cereal box. Besides it\u2019s a sin of Washington etiquette to call a deliberate political misstatements \u201clies.\u201d Only the uncouth call them actual lies. Remember the Barack Obama who proposed pulling our troops out of Iraq by the end of 2008? \u201cThe days of our open-ended commitment must come to a close,\u201d he told the Senate, according to a Jan. 31, 2007, Washington Post article. Now, according to the Associated Press, the open-ended commitment has been replaced with \u201cas many as 50,000 troops to remain behind to train Iraqi forces and protect U.S. interests.\u201d Even anti-war lefties think he lied. They are right \u2013- for once. Remember that guy Obama who supported gun rights? He\u2019s just a faint memory. A year ago, in an interview with Politico, Obama was reminded that supported gun ownership: \u201cYou said recently, \u2018I have no intention of taking away folks\u2019 guns.\u2019 But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you\u2019ve said that it\u2019s constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?\u201d Even then he hemmed and hawed, concluding: \u201cWe can have a reasonable, thoughtful gun control measure that I think respects the Second Amendment and people\u2019s traditions.\u201d \u201cReasonable, thoughtful\u201d are words unknown to Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder already has tried to link the Mexican narco-wars to U.S. gun sales and go after supposed \u201cassault weapons.\u201d Obama\u2019s record on government and the economy is actually worse. He and his surrogates keep maintaining that his budget won\u2019t hurt the pockets of 95 percent of Americans who will get a tax cut. They lie. The lead editorial in the Feb. 27 Wall Street Journal showed by just how much. Using 2006 tax records, The Wall Street Journal showed how a tax hike won\u2019t begin to pay the 2010 budget of the $4 trillion. Even if the government were to confiscate (aka steal) every penny made by those who earn $250,000 and above, it would only meet one-third of the goal. To pay for that whole $4 trillion budget, the government would have to pilfer \u201cevery taxable \u2018dime\u2019 of everyone earning more than $75,000.\u201d That would just barely meet the goal, but those are 2006 numbers when the economy was good. In 2010, we\u2019d need to go even lower. A tax cut for 95 percent? Not hardly. The government will give money with one hand and take it back and loads more with the other \u2013- lying to us the whole time. ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos summed it up well during his March 1 \u201cThis Week\u201d show when, with a slip of the tongue, he referred to the omnibus spending bill as \u201comni-nous spending\u201d \u2013- an appropriate cross between omnibus and ominous spending. No kidding. It takes accidental phrasing to get honesty from the mainstream press \u2013 especially someone like Stephanopoulos who burns his cell phone minutes strategizing with his long-time Democratic buddies like James Carville, Paul Begala and Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. The rest of the time, we get precious little information from the press about how we\u2019ll pay through the nose and every other orifice. Instead, it\u2019s just reheated talking points about 95 percent of us getting tax cuts.

        "content": "It would be nice if just the top 2% of the population could pay for all of the spending that is going on, but it can't and besides, it isn't fair either. It is redistribution of wealth, right from the tool bag of SOCIALISM. Right this minute and for the rest of this generation and at least two generations or more out, the bill for the current spending will continue to be paid for. We have put our future generations into financial slavery. As we write our comments and send our letters and make our phone calls, taxes are being raised on every aspect of our lives that will require EVERY AMERICAN TAXPAYER to pay higher taxes; including the \"non-tax paying\" people. Under Bush and the tax cuts he enacted, the economy grew and our country was able to slug through 9/11 and several major disasters and fight conflicts in two separate areas, as well as send money to other countries to help them with their problems. Our economy was stable. In 2006, the Democrats got control of Congress and for some reason, Bush caught the spending disease and the economy started to waver. We, the people, were told that all was well and that a little belt tightening was all we needed. What really happened was, we were blatantly lied to and not by Bush. We were hoodwinked by the Democrats. Democrats such as Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters and numerous others. They lied to us about the sub-prime lending institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they told America that there was no problem and that these areas were solvent. They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers. To see how much of a lie this was, peruse an article at American Thinker. Go to their website, go to archives and find an article dated March 26th on how our economy became so screwed up. It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders. Now, we have a party-hack-of-a-President spending huge amounts of money and threatening tax increases that is driving our economy further into the toilet. Tax increases at this juncture in our economic crisis is irresponsible and dangerous for America.

As we write our comments and send our letters and make our phone calls, taxes are being raised on every aspect of our lives that will require EVERY AMERICAN TAXPAYER to pay higher taxes; including the \"non-tax paying\" people. Under Bush and the tax cuts he enacted, the economy grew and our country was able to slug through 9/11 and several major disasters and fight conflicts in two separate areas, as well as send money to other countries to help them with their problems. Our economy was stable. In 2006, the Democrats got control of Congress and for some reason, Bush caught the spending disease and the economy started to waver. We, the people, were told that all was well and that a little belt tightening was all we needed. What really happened was, we were blatantly lied to and not by Bush. We were hoodwinked by the Democrats. Democrats such as Barack Obama, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters and numerous others. They lied to us about the sub-prime lending institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they told America that there was no problem and that these areas were solvent. They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers. To see how much of a lie this was, peruse an article at American Thinker. Go to their website, go to archives and find an article dated March 26th on how our economy became so screwed up. It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders.

They lied to us about the sub-prime lending institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they told America that there was no problem and that these areas were solvent. They were also receiving or had received campaign money from these institutions. We learned a harsh lesson; when Democrats lie enmasse, America suffers. To see how much of a lie this was, peruse an article at American Thinker. Go to their website, go to archives and find an article dated March 26th on how our economy became so screwed up. It's a long article, but well worth the reading. It outlines all of the lies and deception foisted on the American people by the radical left in Congress. Our economy started it's downward spiral in earnest when many people defaulted on their home loans, after their adjustable rate mortgages started going up. They were allowed to get into more home than they could possibly afford in the best of times and it was allowed, because our government made it happen. Because of the rewriting of prudent financial rules for homeownership, people were able to get very low interest, adjustable rate mortgages. They were also allowed to purchase homes that were way out of their price range; all because Democrats in Congress rewrote the rules and then lied about the ensuing problems that were beginning to show up. Bush started borrowing and spending to cover America's bills, while hoping that future tax cuts would spur additional economic growth. But, our economy was blindsided by the fiduciary failure of Congress to address the growing sub-prime lending crisis and the responsiblity for that rests squarely on the Democrats shoulders. Now, we have a party-hack-of-a-President spending huge amounts of money and threatening tax increases that is driving our economy further into the toilet. Tax increases at this juncture in our economic crisis is irresponsible and dangerous for America. There are many new taxes on the horizon for energy production, equipment and material production, and the transportation and distribution of all of these. There are also going to be taxes on the services we need and use everyday; taxes that will hit EVERYONE in the wallet. We sure got change we can believe in and we are going to have to \"BELIEVE\" it for four long years. No country, state or municipality ever taxed itself into prosperity; just into decline. What does our future hold? Unfortunately unless you live in la la land services cost money. Thats a fact of life and a concept the spoiled generation cannot grasp. People losing homes, jobs, and savings and yet the restraunts are full,roads congested and travel agents booming. Disney world and ammusment parks toy stores all doing good. God bless America. Well people Wars throw a monkey wrench into that fairy land sceniero and are costly. Where does the the money come from? So what services or luxuries do you want to give up? Cant have it both ways.",

It is redistribution of wealth, right from the tool bag of SOCIALISM. Right this minute and for the rest of this generation and at least two generations or more out, the bill for the current spending will continue to be paid for. We have put our future generations into financial slavery. As we write our comments and send our letters and make our phone calls, taxes are being raised on every aspect of our lives that will require EVERY AMERICAN TAXPAYER to pay higher taxes; including the \"non-tax paying\" people. Under Bush and the tax cuts he enacted, the economy grew and our country was able to slug through 9/11 and several major disasters and fight conflicts in two separate areas, as well as send money to other countries to help them with their problems. Our economy was stable. In 2006, the Democrats got control of Congress and for some reason, Bush caught the spending disease and the economy started to waver.

In the nearly eight weeks since Obama\u2019s inauguration, as the new administration and congressional Democrats have pushed through a $787 billion stimulus package and a $410 spending bill to fund the federal government\u2019s operations, Republican congressional leaders have stressed fiscal restraint and accused Democrats of spending money the government does not have and should not be borrowing.

Mark Sanford in a new television ad next week that criticizes him for deciding not to accept all of the stimulus money set aside for his state, CNN has learned. Sanford, a Republican who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2012, has maintained that spending the funds would only make the state\u2019s financial situation worse in the long term. Instead, the governor told state legislators earlier this week that he wants to use a quarter of his state\u2019s stimulus money to pay down its debt. Sanford\u2019s request applies only to the $700 million in stimulus funds that he has discretion over, while the remaining $2.1 billion set aside for the state will be spent according to federal guidelines.",
