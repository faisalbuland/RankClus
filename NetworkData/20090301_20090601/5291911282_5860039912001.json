It'd be a lot easier to concentrate on the activity of a few well-used categories.

Moderators generally exist to keep a conversation/debate on topic and an even keel, encourage participants to elaborate on unclear points, and remain objective.

Perhaps, if a person signs on to be a mod, they have to either refrain from posting in a given thread, or stop posting altogether.
