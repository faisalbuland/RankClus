Officials told The Associated Press the arrests came after a long-running undercover operation that began in Newburgh, N.Y., about 70 miles north of New York City. James Cromitie, David Williams, Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen, all of Newburgh, were charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction within the United States and conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles, the U.S. attorney's office said. The men had planned to detonate a car with plastic explosives outside a temple in the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale and to shoot military planes at the New York Air National Guard base at Stewart Airport in Newburgh with Stinger surface-to-air guided missiles, authorities said. The defendants planned to \"destroy a synagogue and a Jewish community center with C-4 plastic explosives,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin said. The religious targets were the Riverdale Temple, founded in 1947, and the Riverdale Jewish Center, authorities said. more at (*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090521/ap_on_re_us/us_temple_plot*)",

Officials told The Associated Press the arrests came after a long-running undercover operation that began in Newburgh, N.Y., about 70 miles north of New York City. James Cromitie, David Williams, Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen, all of Newburgh, were charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction within the United States and conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles, the U.S. attorney's office said. The men had planned to detonate a car with plastic explosives outside a temple in the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale and to shoot military planes at the New York Air National Guard base at Stewart Airport in Newburgh with Stinger surface-to-air guided missiles, authorities said.

Where the F would these clowns get a hold of a stinger missle? You think they \"bought\" that as well? As if some street punks could buy more than a saturday night special? As I said, I'm not going to waste any tears over people ready to bomb holy sites, or shoot down a plane - But give me a break? Big terrorist case my azz. Dave",
