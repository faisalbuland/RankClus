I didn't vote for him, I don't follow his BS, and I wish the media would stop pretending that he somehow represents my attitude and opinions. You're right - Perez Hilton is a walking, talking, nasty stereotype. And you know what's miserable about stereotypes? People apply them to entire demographics because it's EASY to put the label on everyone instead of seeing people as people. The stereotype isn't the reality. It's just the nasty bit of bile that happens to get ratings for the networks, so they play it over and over again. Most gays would NOT offend \"middle-of-the-road\" Americans. Many of us ARE middle-of-the-road Americans! We work in your offices, live on your street, and you wouldn't be able to tell unless you happened to catch me squeezing my wife's hand and whispering to her that I love her. Why don't you see normal, middle-of-the-road, gay Americans? Simple: because we're as boring and normal as everyone else? We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, walk the dog, put on boring work clothes, put in 8+ hours, come home, walk the dog again, cook dinner, try to do some chores or maybe read a book, and go to bed. Not exactly prime-time material, huh? So, people are voting a certain way because the loud, obnoxious stereotypes are being blasted all over the media, while the vast majority of gay folks have to suffer the consequences. If we speak up, we add to the problem; if we remain silent, the problem will never go away. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. We just want the freedom to take care of our families and loved ones without fighting a constant uphill battle against every law and organization trying to make it harder.

The general population has had the chance to witness the reality of many stereotypes when the image of Perez Hilton spewing his vulgarity is played over and over again. I doubt the experience has left a favorable impression. See, that whole \"antics of the gay community\" seems to indicate that people believe that all gay people (and those who support equal rights for gays) behave the same way. To note, every gay person I know has said that they think Perez Hilton is a low-life slime-ball with no class, and we wish he'd shut up. HE DOES NOT REPRESENT ME. I didn't vote for him, I don't follow his BS, and I wish the media would stop pretending that he somehow represents my attitude and opinions. You're right - Perez Hilton is a walking, talking, nasty stereotype. And you know what's miserable about stereotypes? People apply them to entire demographics because it's EASY to put the label on everyone instead of seeing people as people. The stereotype isn't the reality. It's just the nasty bit of bile that happens to get ratings for the networks, so they play it over and over again. Most gays would NOT offend \"middle-of-the-road\" Americans. Many of us ARE middle-of-the-road Americans! We work in your offices, live on your street, and you wouldn't be able to tell unless you happened to catch me squeezing my wife's hand and whispering to her that I love her. Why don't you see normal, middle-of-the-road, gay Americans? Simple: because we're as boring and normal as everyone else? We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, walk the dog, put on boring work clothes, put in 8+ hours, come home, walk the dog again, cook dinner, try to do some chores or maybe read a book, and go to bed. Not exactly prime-time material, huh? So, people are voting a certain way because the loud, obnoxious stereotypes are being blasted all over the media, while the vast majority of gay folks have to suffer the consequences. If we speak up, we add to the problem; if we remain silent, the problem will never go away. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. We just want the freedom to take care of our families and loved ones without fighting a constant uphill battle against every law and organization trying to make it harder. Hell, I'd just like to check \"married\" when I fill out a medical form and not have someone try to argue with me!",

I always hated the civil rights struggle being compared to the gay marriage issue. Must be principle, because I'm an atheist!! Now I guess I'm a piece of sheiit again!",

Considering the antics of the gay community over the past 6 months I suspect that if the vote were repeated more people would vote against it. That will be interesting to see - it appears likely that the issue will be presented again on the next ballot. Will the pro-prop-8 side maintain their energy and turnout, or will the anti-prop-8 crowd shift that slight majority to a minority? Also, how will the fact of the 18,000 married gay couples be resolved? The court reiterated that they remain married, but how will that fit into everything? How will people resolve allowing those couples to remain married when no others can? I voted against a similar proposition in FL, in part because it was a bad law and in part because whether or not gay marriage is legal has no bearing what so ever on my life. If it comes up again I am not sure I would vote the same way. The gay community has gone out of its way to alienate many 'middle of the road' Americans. The general population has had the chance to witness the reality of many stereotypes when the image of Perez Hilton spewing his vulgarity is played over and over again. I doubt the experience has left a favorable impression. See, that whole \"antics of the gay community\" seems to indicate that people believe that all gay people (and those who support equal rights for gays) behave the same way. To note, every gay person I know has said that they think Perez Hilton is a low-life slime-ball with no class, and we wish he'd shut up. HE DOES NOT REPRESENT ME. I didn't vote for him, I don't follow his BS, and I wish the media would stop pretending that he somehow represents my attitude and opinions. You're right - Perez Hilton is a walking, talking, nasty stereotype. And you know what's miserable about stereotypes? People apply them to entire demographics because it's EASY to put the label on everyone instead of seeing people as people. The stereotype isn't the reality. It's just the nasty bit of bile that happens to get ratings for the networks, so they play it over and over again. Most gays would NOT offend \"middle-of-the-road\" Americans. Many of us ARE middle-of-the-road Americans! We work in your offices, live on your street, and you wouldn't be able to tell unless you happened to catch me squeezing my wife's hand and whispering to her that I love her. Why don't you see normal, middle-of-the-road, gay Americans? Simple: because we're as boring and normal as everyone else? We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, walk the dog, put on boring work clothes, put in 8+ hours, come home, walk the dog again, cook dinner, try to do some chores or maybe read a book, and go to bed. Not exactly prime-time material, huh? So, people are voting a certain way because the loud, obnoxious stereotypes are being blasted all over the media, while the vast majority of gay folks have to suffer the consequences. If we speak up, we add to the problem; if we remain silent, the problem will never go away. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. We just want the freedom to take care of our families and loved ones without fighting a constant uphill battle against every law and organization trying to make it harder. Hell, I'd just like to check \"married\" when I fill out a medical form and not have someone try to argue with me!",

The general population has had the chance to witness the reality of many stereotypes when the image of Perez Hilton spewing his vulgarity is played over and over again. I doubt the experience has left a favorable impression. See, that whole \"antics of the gay community\" seems to indicate that people believe that all gay people (and those who support equal rights for gays) behave the same way. To note, every gay person I know has said that they think Perez Hilton is a low-life slime-ball with no class, and we wish he'd shut up. HE DOES NOT REPRESENT ME. I didn't vote for him, I don't follow his BS, and I wish the media would stop pretending that he somehow represents my attitude and opinions. You're right - Perez Hilton is a walking, talking, nasty stereotype. And you know what's miserable about stereotypes? People apply them to entire demographics because it's EASY to put the label on everyone instead of seeing people as people. The stereotype isn't the reality. It's just the nasty bit of bile that happens to get ratings for the networks, so they play it over and over again. Most gays would NOT offend \"middle-of-the-road\" Americans. Many of us ARE middle-of-the-road Americans! We work in your offices, live on your street, and you wouldn't be able to tell unless you happened to catch me squeezing my wife's hand and whispering to her that I love her. Why don't you see normal, middle-of-the-road, gay Americans? Simple: because we're as boring and normal as everyone else? We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, walk the dog, put on boring work clothes, put in 8+ hours, come home, walk the dog again, cook dinner, try to do some chores or maybe read a book, and go to bed. Not exactly prime-time material, huh? So, people are voting a certain way because the loud, obnoxious stereotypes are being blasted all over the media, while the vast majority of gay folks have to suffer the consequences. If we speak up, we add to the problem; if we remain silent, the problem will never go away. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. We just want the freedom to take care of our families and loved ones without fighting a constant uphill battle against every law and organization trying to make it harder. Hell, I'd just like to check \"married\" when I fill out a medical form and not have someone try to argue with me!",

Also, how will the fact of the 18,000 married gay couples be resolved? The court reiterated that they remain married, but how will that fit into everything? How will people resolve allowing those couples to remain married when no others can? I voted against a similar proposition in FL, in part because it was a bad law and in part because whether or not gay marriage is legal has no bearing what so ever on my life. If it comes up again I am not sure I would vote the same way. The gay community has gone out of its way to alienate many 'middle of the road' Americans. The general population has had the chance to witness the reality of many stereotypes when the image of Perez Hilton spewing his vulgarity is played over and over again. I doubt the experience has left a favorable impression.",

To note, every gay person I know has said that they think Perez Hilton is a low-life slime-ball with no class, and we wish he'd shut up. HE DOES NOT REPRESENT ME. I didn't vote for him, I don't follow his BS, and I wish the media would stop pretending that he somehow represents my attitude and opinions. You're right - Perez Hilton is a walking, talking, nasty stereotype. And you know what's miserable about stereotypes? People apply them to entire demographics because it's EASY to put the label on everyone instead of seeing people as people. The stereotype isn't the reality. It's just the nasty bit of bile that happens to get ratings for the networks, so they play it over and over again. Most gays would NOT offend \"middle-of-the-road\" Americans. Many of us ARE middle-of-the-road Americans! We work in your offices, live on your street, and you wouldn't be able to tell unless you happened to catch me squeezing my wife's hand and whispering to her that I love her. Why don't you see normal, middle-of-the-road, gay Americans? Simple: because we're as boring and normal as everyone else? We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, walk the dog, put on boring work clothes, put in 8+ hours, come home, walk the dog again, cook dinner, try to do some chores or maybe read a book, and go to bed. Not exactly prime-time material, huh? So, people are voting a certain way because the loud, obnoxious stereotypes are being blasted all over the media, while the vast majority of gay folks have to suffer the consequences. If we speak up, we add to the problem; if we remain silent, the problem will never go away. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. We just want the freedom to take care of our families and loved ones without fighting a constant uphill battle against every law and organization trying to make it harder. Hell, I'd just like to check \"married\" when I fill out a medical form and not have someone try to argue with me!",

You're right - Perez Hilton is a walking, talking, nasty stereotype. And you know what's miserable about stereotypes?

It's just the nasty bit of bile that happens to get ratings for the networks, so they play it over and over again. Most gays would NOT offend \"middle-of-the-road\" Americans. Many of us ARE middle-of-the-road Americans! We work in your offices, live on your street, and you wouldn't be able to tell unless you happened to catch me squeezing my wife's hand and whispering to her that I love her. Why don't you see normal, middle-of-the-road, gay Americans? Simple: because we're as boring and normal as everyone else? We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, walk the dog, put on boring work clothes, put in 8+ hours, come home, walk the dog again, cook dinner, try to do some chores or maybe read a book, and go to bed. Not exactly prime-time material, huh? So, people are voting a certain way because the loud, obnoxious stereotypes are being blasted all over the media, while the vast majority of gay folks have to suffer the consequences. If we speak up, we add to the problem; if we remain silent, the problem will never go away. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. We just want the freedom to take care of our families and loved ones without fighting a constant uphill battle against every law and organization trying to make it harder.

It's just the nasty bit of bile that happens to get ratings for the networks, so they play it over and over again. Most gays would NOT offend \"middle-of-the-road\" Americans.

Why don't you see normal, middle-of-the-road, gay Americans? Simple: because we're as boring and normal as everyone else? We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, walk the dog, put on boring work clothes, put in 8+ hours, come home, walk the dog again, cook dinner, try to do some chores or maybe read a book, and go to bed. Not exactly prime-time material, huh? So, people are voting a certain way because the loud, obnoxious stereotypes are being blasted all over the media, while the vast majority of gay folks have to suffer the consequences. If we speak up, we add to the problem; if we remain silent, the problem will never go away. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. We just want the freedom to take care of our families and loved ones without fighting a constant uphill battle against every law and organization trying to make it harder.
