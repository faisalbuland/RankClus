At a Downing Street reception to celebrate LGBT History Month attended by prominent gay leaders, Brown called California's Proposition 8 \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Brown's own party, the Labour Party, legalized civil unions for gay and lesbian couples in 2005. The UK has also allowed open gay service in the military since 2000. Proposition 8 reversed a California Supreme Court ruling allowing gay marriage in the state when it defined marriage as a heterosexual union in the state constitution. Voters approved the measure by a narrow 52%. Yesterday, the state Supreme Court heard arguments in a lawsuit that seeks to void the measure. A decision is expected in 90 days. Discussing Proposition 8, Brown said \u201cthis attempt to undo good that has been done is unacceptable.\u201d \u201cThis shows why we have always got to be vigilant, always got to fight homophobic behavior and any form of discrimination,\u201d the prime minister added. He also praised UK gay rights leaders for \u201cchanging opinion\u201d about civil unions for gays and lesbians. \u201cYou shown how the legislative process, by your pressure, can respond,\u201d Brown said. >http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=3390&MediaType=1&Category=24",

I wish that Americans could just take a look at the many countries that have granted legal rights to gay couples (whether Civil Unions or marriage) and have permitted gays to serve openly in their armed forces, and see that none of those countries have had any problems as a result. Their nations didn't implode, their armies haven't failed, their citizens haven't rioted, their civilizations haven't collapsed. Life went on, and people didn't have a problem with it. What is it about Americans that makes us (as a nation) think that we're so different from every other nation on the planet that we have to remain stuck in the past? All of our allies and other modern industrial nations have pulled their heads out of their butts, but we're stuck in reverse. Amazing.",
