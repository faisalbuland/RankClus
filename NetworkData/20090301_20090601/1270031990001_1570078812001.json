        "content": "All, I am sorry if this has been posted previously, but I just watched a super series of videos on Youtube that is a dialog/debate on the viewpoints of religion and atheism. The conversation is articulate and respectful of each other and their viewpoints. The atheist is Hemant Mehtah of the Happy Atheist website and the religious side is represented by Jay Gamelin, who is the pastor of Jacob's Porch. I think it is a great way to show how two sides can differ on their opinions without attacking the other side personally. It is a series of nine videos of about 10 minutes each titled \"Faith Dialogue\" I am putting the link to the first video below, but not sure if that is allowed now and may have to edit it out if the moderators don't like it. MOD HAT ON Hot links are not allowed on this site. To convert it to a cold link, just add an additional character to both ends of the lins, as billbright demonstrated below.
