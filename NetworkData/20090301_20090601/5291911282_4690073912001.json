I just got my rate as an OS3 and I felt like my command is screwing me. I got picked up as an alternate for IA. Recently I found out that I have to go IA because one of the Primary person, who volunteer for IA, could not go IA for some reasons... She's getting married and She said her chain of command screwed her because she turned in her leave chit 7 months before her expected time to go IA. Now she didn't want to go. I felt like they're forcing me to go for some stupid reasons and trying to correct the mistakes of my chain of command. I will have to talk to my CO about this because I felt it's unfair. Where is the Equal opportunity in my command? I don't mind going to IRAQ, but I have to stand for what's right. Please free to say your opinions... Thanks OS3",

You're not taking a stand for what's right. You're complaining on this forum and lookiing for justification that you're right.
