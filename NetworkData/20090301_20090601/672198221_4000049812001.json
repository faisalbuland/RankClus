It has come to my attention that America\u2019s Clean Water Foundation, where I once served on the board of directors, has become the subject of scrutiny.

Jackson said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that Jon Cannon will be unable to serve as Deputy Administrator, and I thank him for his many years of dedication to the EPA.
