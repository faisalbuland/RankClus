Its true most Moldavians are actually Romanians and has an overwhelmingly older population who dont even understand the concept of democracy. It should not have come as any surprise that there was a 50% vote for the communist party as the last election had a 43% vote for the communists. Also strange to note is how many more Moldavians appear to have twitter accounts than there are active internet connections in the country by a rate of nearly 10 to 1. Are they all crowing around the same computer? Seems to me some more color meddling going on. Since Orange, purple, Rose have already been used and red is surely not a color they would use, what color will they use in another American backed and financed \"revolution\" Were the elections fair? probably not any less fair than the election in Ukraine that put the corrupt American puppet Yushchenko or the election that put insane Saakashvili in power.",
