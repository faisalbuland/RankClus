The United States has been a Socialist State for many-many years, and you are more than likely a beneficiary of the many social programs the United States offers it's citizens. Just recently, for example, the largest Socialist initiative ever supported by and pushed thru by none other than Republican President George W. Bush (seemingly so many peoples hero here), bailing out the banks and financial institutions (with little or no oversight or accountability), probably as a final reward paid for by US taxpayers for all their support of him the past 8 years. Your President, a flaming Socialist! At least the new President Obama has in place, checks, balances, and highly placed overseer's to make sure the Stimulus money will be spent properly. I believe you may just have \"Socialism\" a bit confused with \"Communism\" anyway. Nothing wrong with Socialism at all. \"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.\" - T. Jefferson",
