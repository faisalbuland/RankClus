The 'poster ville' for Marine pacification - walled security and limited electronically montored access - has become a zone of operations after the hiatus resulting from the 'Surge' rent-a-pal program. When the US stopped paying Sahwa forces and turned them over to the tender ministrations of the central government, stability and security began a slide process. Sahwa has begun to be more active in countering what the Sunnis percieve as an increased threat from Shiites. This, in turn, is being reflected onto Americans who are percieved to be the spine which holds Maliki and company in a vertical position. The Sunnis are portraying themselves as Iraqi nationalists and opposed to any outside interference in Iraq.",
