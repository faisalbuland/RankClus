The only people IMO that should be allowed to smoke are Veterans who just come back from Combat missions. North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue made history today, signing into law a smoking ban in the state's restaurants and bars. Perdue presided over the bill-signing ceremony in the Old House Chamber of the State Capitol Building. The measure passed last week would allow fines of up to $50 for people who smoke after being asked to stop, and up to $200 for managers who've been warned twice to enforce the rules. Perdue said last week that the smoking restrictions are a historic step to protect health in what is still the country's biggest tobacco-growing state. She said she has vigorously supported efforts to reduce and eliminate smoking. More than 30 states have passed similar legislation. Virginia adopted a ban in March despite its 400-year history with tobacco.",
