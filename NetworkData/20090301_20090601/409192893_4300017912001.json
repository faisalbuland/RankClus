        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base.

As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it.

        "reply": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either.

        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

        "content": "Save the article for about 24-30 months\u2026 then re-post it\u2026. Unemployment has not even begun and we have yet to even feel that pain\u2026 Thus far most of those who were laid-off have been able to juggle and keep things sort-a together. The unemployment phenomenon didn\u2019t start until the election was on the last lap. Have ya noticed there isn\u2019t too much hype about Circuit City filing bankruptcy \u2013 haven\u2019t really heard a peep from Best Buys even when they\u2019ve already said they\u2019re going under\u2026 If I\u2019m not mistaken, those two corporations are upwards in the top 5 retail \u2013 employment companies in the country. The unemployment checks will start running out for the first wave some time before this Christmas \u2013 merry Christmas \u2013 and by the way \u2013 don\u2019t put up a tree this year \u2013 you may have to take it down when they foreclose\u2026 So that means 2009 will start off with a \u201cbang\u201d and by April-May the next wave will start ending their checks. Obama has already attempted to throw the early winners in the unemployment line a bone \u2013 don\u2019t know what happened to it but he was talking about giving those folks and extra 100 bucks per check \u2013 ya know to help them keep their houses\u2026. I tend to think that\u2019s Nancy\u2019s kind-of financial planning though because hey \u2013 1800-dollar house payment \u2013 and an extra few hundred bucks to pay towards a house payment that probably hasn\u2019t been paid for a few months already \u2013 but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts right\u2026. Unemployment up to 8.6 and climbing faster than thermometer on hot summer afternoon \u2013 yep, right now most folks are able to juggle - borrow \u2013 charge \u2013 skip a few payments \u2013 tap the 401K \u2013 cash in a stocks \u2013 then when all that starts drying up \u2013 that\u2019s when things will start becoming a little edgy.

Unemployment has not even begun and we have yet to even feel that pain\u2026 Thus far most of those who were laid-off have been able to juggle and keep things sort-a together. The unemployment phenomenon didn\u2019t start until the election was on the last lap. Have ya noticed there isn\u2019t too much hype about Circuit City filing bankruptcy \u2013 haven\u2019t really heard a peep from Best Buys even when they\u2019ve already said they\u2019re going under\u2026 If I\u2019m not mistaken, those two corporations are upwards in the top 5 retail \u2013 employment companies in the country. The unemployment checks will start running out for the first wave some time before this Christmas \u2013 merry Christmas \u2013 and by the way \u2013 don\u2019t put up a tree this year \u2013 you may have to take it down when they foreclose\u2026 So that means 2009 will start off with a \u201cbang\u201d and by April-May the next wave will start ending their checks. Obama has already attempted to throw the early winners in the unemployment line a bone \u2013 don\u2019t know what happened to it but he was talking about giving those folks and extra 100 bucks per check \u2013 ya know to help them keep their houses\u2026. I tend to think that\u2019s Nancy\u2019s kind-of financial planning though because hey \u2013 1800-dollar house payment \u2013 and an extra few hundred bucks to pay towards a house payment that probably hasn\u2019t been paid for a few months already \u2013 but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts right\u2026. Unemployment up to 8.6 and climbing faster than thermometer on hot summer afternoon \u2013 yep, right now most folks are able to juggle - borrow \u2013 charge \u2013 skip a few payments \u2013 tap the 401K \u2013 cash in a stocks \u2013 then when all that starts drying up \u2013 that\u2019s when things will start becoming a little edgy.

        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

        "content": "Save the article for about 24-30 months\u2026 then re-post it\u2026. Unemployment has not even begun and we have yet to even feel that pain\u2026 Thus far most of those who were laid-off have been able to juggle and keep things sort-a together. The unemployment phenomenon didn\u2019t start until the election was on the last lap. Have ya noticed there isn\u2019t too much hype about Circuit City filing bankruptcy \u2013 haven\u2019t really heard a peep from Best Buys even when they\u2019ve already said they\u2019re going under\u2026 If I\u2019m not mistaken, those two corporations are upwards in the top 5 retail \u2013 employment companies in the country. The unemployment checks will start running out for the first wave some time before this Christmas \u2013 merry Christmas \u2013 and by the way \u2013 don\u2019t put up a tree this year \u2013 you may have to take it down when they foreclose\u2026 So that means 2009 will start off with a \u201cbang\u201d and by April-May the next wave will start ending their checks. Obama has already attempted to throw the early winners in the unemployment line a bone \u2013 don\u2019t know what happened to it but he was talking about giving those folks and extra 100 bucks per check \u2013 ya know to help them keep their houses\u2026. I tend to think that\u2019s Nancy\u2019s kind-of financial planning though because hey \u2013 1800-dollar house payment \u2013 and an extra few hundred bucks to pay towards a house payment that probably hasn\u2019t been paid for a few months already \u2013 but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts right\u2026. Unemployment up to 8.6 and climbing faster than thermometer on hot summer afternoon \u2013 yep, right now most folks are able to juggle - borrow \u2013 charge \u2013 skip a few payments \u2013 tap the 401K \u2013 cash in a stocks \u2013 then when all that starts drying up \u2013 that\u2019s when things will start becoming a little edgy. The REAL travesty going on is that our Progressive socialists are blowing their wad NOW \u2013 and that is going to cause a catastrophic implosion within this country. When unemployment starts banging 14-15 percent \u2013 and 60-70% of those no longer eligible for unemployment benefits \u2013 people are going to start getting really on edge. The irony is \u2013 that isn\u2019t even the beginning \u2013 by that time Obama will have had his \u201cgreen\u201d agenda churning & burning \u2013 and guess what the does \u2013 those businesses already strained from the monstrous tax hike that NO ONE seems to be comprehending when they SPEND TRILLIONS of dollars\u2026 but hey it gets better because by then Nancy will have her additional 1.50 per gallon tax \u2013 which btw \u2013 will impact EVERYTHING you buy \u2013 which will also create a few more unemployment lines \u2013 and it keeps getting better \u2013 by that time those who were able to keep their houses \u2013 well Obama needs the extra bucks so NO MORE right-offs for the interest on your house payment \u2013 and as most have already heard \u2013 corporations will no longer be able to right-off their donations to charities \u2013 so here\u2019s the funny part about that one\u2026 That means all those Charities that would normally helped out in a crisis \u2013 soup kitchens \u2013 etc \u2013 well \u2013 guess what \u2013 they won\u2019t have any money so WHO does everyone get to look to and beg for bread\u2026 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\u2026 Now, that is Progressive socialist democrats fantasy-world dream come true! The Fed has a little bit of a problem following them around like a TRILLION POUND GORRILLA \u2013 in FIVE YEARS the national debt will be so HUGE the US cannot even afford to pay the interest payments. In fact, in FIVE YEARS the debt alone will consume over50% of the ENTIRE FEDERAL BUDGET\u2026 So, just when they will need every ounce of credit they can possibly BEG for \u2013 they will have ALREADY SPENT that money\u2026 Man, I would NOT want to live in a city when this starts unraveling \u2013 gangs will rule\u2026 \u2026but then maybe not\u2026 So, save that article to repost in about two years... but, hey, we'll all be so busy we probably won't even have time to read it... hopefully busy working... I doubt that though - work - democrat - work democrat - that is an oxymoron and contradiction all by itself... One would think that they'd have learned by now - take way the ability for conservatives to \"EARN\" a living - and the democrats have no one left to tax... go figure!",

The unemployment phenomenon didn\u2019t start until the election was on the last lap. Have ya noticed there isn\u2019t too much hype about Circuit City filing bankruptcy \u2013 haven\u2019t really heard a peep from Best Buys even when they\u2019ve already said they\u2019re going under\u2026 If I\u2019m not mistaken, those two corporations are upwards in the top 5 retail \u2013 employment companies in the country. The unemployment checks will start running out for the first wave some time before this Christmas \u2013 merry Christmas \u2013 and by the way \u2013 don\u2019t put up a tree this year \u2013 you may have to take it down when they foreclose\u2026 So that means 2009 will start off with a \u201cbang\u201d and by April-May the next wave will start ending their checks. Obama has already attempted to throw the early winners in the unemployment line a bone \u2013 don\u2019t know what happened to it but he was talking about giving those folks and extra 100 bucks per check \u2013 ya know to help them keep their houses\u2026. I tend to think that\u2019s Nancy\u2019s kind-of financial planning though because hey \u2013 1800-dollar house payment \u2013 and an extra few hundred bucks to pay towards a house payment that probably hasn\u2019t been paid for a few months already \u2013 but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts right\u2026. Unemployment up to 8.6 and climbing faster than thermometer on hot summer afternoon \u2013 yep, right now most folks are able to juggle - borrow \u2013 charge \u2013 skip a few payments \u2013 tap the 401K \u2013 cash in a stocks \u2013 then when all that starts drying up \u2013 that\u2019s when things will start becoming a little edgy. The REAL travesty going on is that our Progressive socialists are blowing their wad NOW \u2013 and that is going to cause a catastrophic implosion within this country. When unemployment starts banging 14-15 percent \u2013 and 60-70% of those no longer eligible for unemployment benefits \u2013 people are going to start getting really on edge. The irony is \u2013 that isn\u2019t even the beginning \u2013 by that time Obama will have had his \u201cgreen\u201d agenda churning & burning \u2013 and guess what the does \u2013 those businesses already strained from the monstrous tax hike that NO ONE seems to be comprehending when they SPEND TRILLIONS of dollars\u2026 but hey it gets better because by then Nancy will have her additional 1.50 per gallon tax \u2013 which btw \u2013 will impact EVERYTHING you buy \u2013 which will also create a few more unemployment lines \u2013 and it keeps getting better \u2013 by that time those who were able to keep their houses \u2013 well Obama needs the extra bucks so NO MORE right-offs for the interest on your house payment \u2013 and as most have already heard \u2013 corporations will no longer be able to right-off their donations to charities \u2013 so here\u2019s the funny part about that one\u2026 That means all those Charities that would normally helped out in a crisis \u2013 soup kitchens \u2013 etc \u2013 well \u2013 guess what \u2013 they won\u2019t have any money so WHO does everyone get to look to and beg for bread\u2026 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\u2026 Now, that is Progressive socialist democrats fantasy-world dream come true! The Fed has a little bit of a problem following them around like a TRILLION POUND GORRILLA \u2013 in FIVE YEARS the national debt will be so HUGE the US cannot even afford to pay the interest payments. In fact, in FIVE YEARS the debt alone will consume over50% of the ENTIRE FEDERAL BUDGET\u2026 So, just when they will need every ounce of credit they can possibly BEG for \u2013 they will have ALREADY SPENT that money\u2026 Man, I would NOT want to live in a city when this starts unraveling \u2013 gangs will rule\u2026 \u2026but then maybe not\u2026 So, save that article to repost in about two years... but, hey, we'll all be so busy we probably won't even have time to read it... hopefully busy working... I doubt that though - work - democrat - work democrat - that is an oxymoron and contradiction all by itself... One would think that they'd have learned by now - take way the ability for conservatives to \"EARN\" a living - and the democrats have no one left to tax... go figure!",

        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",

The unemployment phenomenon didn\u2019t start until the election was on the last lap.

The unemployment checks will start running out for the first wave some time before this Christmas \u2013 merry Christmas \u2013 and by the way \u2013 don\u2019t put up a tree this year \u2013 you may have to take it down when they foreclose\u2026 So that means 2009 will start off with a \u201cbang\u201d and by April-May the next wave will start ending their checks. Obama has already attempted to throw the early winners in the unemployment line a bone \u2013 don\u2019t know what happened to it but he was talking about giving those folks and extra 100 bucks per check \u2013 ya know to help them keep their houses\u2026. I tend to think that\u2019s Nancy\u2019s kind-of financial planning though because hey \u2013 1800-dollar house payment \u2013 and an extra few hundred bucks to pay towards a house payment that probably hasn\u2019t been paid for a few months already \u2013 but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts right\u2026. Unemployment up to 8.6 and climbing faster than thermometer on hot summer afternoon \u2013 yep, right now most folks are able to juggle - borrow \u2013 charge \u2013 skip a few payments \u2013 tap the 401K \u2013 cash in a stocks \u2013 then when all that starts drying up \u2013 that\u2019s when things will start becoming a little edgy. The REAL travesty going on is that our Progressive socialists are blowing their wad NOW \u2013 and that is going to cause a catastrophic implosion within this country. When unemployment starts banging 14-15 percent \u2013 and 60-70% of those no longer eligible for unemployment benefits \u2013 people are going to start getting really on edge. The irony is \u2013 that isn\u2019t even the beginning \u2013 by that time Obama will have had his \u201cgreen\u201d agenda churning & burning \u2013 and guess what the does \u2013 those businesses already strained from the monstrous tax hike that NO ONE seems to be comprehending when they SPEND TRILLIONS of dollars\u2026 but hey it gets better because by then Nancy will have her additional 1.50 per gallon tax \u2013 which btw \u2013 will impact EVERYTHING you buy \u2013 which will also create a few more unemployment lines \u2013 and it keeps getting better \u2013 by that time those who were able to keep their houses \u2013 well Obama needs the extra bucks so NO MORE right-offs for the interest on your house payment \u2013 and as most have already heard \u2013 corporations will no longer be able to right-off their donations to charities \u2013 so here\u2019s the funny part about that one\u2026 That means all those Charities that would normally helped out in a crisis \u2013 soup kitchens \u2013 etc \u2013 well \u2013 guess what \u2013 they won\u2019t have any money so WHO does everyone get to look to and beg for bread\u2026 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\u2026 Now, that is Progressive socialist democrats fantasy-world dream come true! The Fed has a little bit of a problem following them around like a TRILLION POUND GORRILLA \u2013 in FIVE YEARS the national debt will be so HUGE the US cannot even afford to pay the interest payments. In fact, in FIVE YEARS the debt alone will consume over50% of the ENTIRE FEDERAL BUDGET\u2026 So, just when they will need every ounce of credit they can possibly BEG for \u2013 they will have ALREADY SPENT that money\u2026 Man, I would NOT want to live in a city when this starts unraveling \u2013 gangs will rule\u2026 \u2026but then maybe not\u2026 So, save that article to repost in about two years... but, hey, we'll all be so busy we probably won't even have time to read it... hopefully busy working... I doubt that though - work - democrat - work democrat - that is an oxymoron and contradiction all by itself... One would think that they'd have learned by now - take way the ability for conservatives to \"EARN\" a living - and the democrats have no one left to tax... go figure!",

The irony is \u2013 that isn\u2019t even the beginning \u2013 by that time Obama will have had his \u201cgreen\u201d agenda churning & burning \u2013 and guess what the does \u2013 those businesses already strained from the monstrous tax hike that NO ONE seems to be comprehending when they SPEND TRILLIONS of dollars\u2026 but hey it gets better because by then Nancy will have her additional 1.50 per gallon tax \u2013 which btw \u2013 will impact EVERYTHING you buy \u2013 which will also create a few more unemployment lines \u2013 and it keeps getting better \u2013 by that time those who were able to keep their houses \u2013 well Obama needs the extra bucks so NO MORE right-offs for the interest on your house payment \u2013 and as most have already heard \u2013 corporations will no longer be able to right-off their donations to charities \u2013 so here\u2019s the funny part about that one\u2026 That means all those Charities that would normally helped out in a crisis \u2013 soup kitchens \u2013 etc \u2013 well \u2013 guess what \u2013 they won\u2019t have any money so WHO does everyone get to look to and beg for bread\u2026 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\u2026 Now, that is Progressive socialist democrats fantasy-world dream come true! The Fed has a little bit of a problem following them around like a TRILLION POUND GORRILLA \u2013 in FIVE YEARS the national debt will be so HUGE the US cannot even afford to pay the interest payments. In fact, in FIVE YEARS the debt alone will consume over50% of the ENTIRE FEDERAL BUDGET\u2026 So, just when they will need every ounce of credit they can possibly BEG for \u2013 they will have ALREADY SPENT that money\u2026 Man, I would NOT want to live in a city when this starts unraveling \u2013 gangs will rule\u2026 \u2026but then maybe not\u2026 So, save that article to repost in about two years... but, hey, we'll all be so busy we probably won't even have time to read it... hopefully busy working... I doubt that though - work - democrat - work democrat - that is an oxymoron and contradiction all by itself... One would think that they'd have learned by now - take way the ability for conservatives to \"EARN\" a living - and the democrats have no one left to tax... go figure!",

        "content": "My fellow right-wingers, calm down. The new president is not the antichrist, Stalin or even a radical. By David Horowitz Apr. 02, 2009 | I have been watching an interesting phenomenon on the right, which is beginning to cause me concern. I am referring to the over-the-top hysteria in response to the first months in office of our new president, which distinctly reminds me of the \"Bush is Hitler\" crowd on the left. Speaking of this crowd, have you seen any \"I am so sorry\" postings from that quarter as Obama continues and even escalates the former president's war policy in Afghanistan and attempts to consolidate his military occupation of Iraq? Conservatives, please. Let's not duplicate the manias of the left as we figure out how to deal with Mr. Obama. He is not exactly the antichrist, although a disturbing number of people on the right are convinced he is. I have recently received commentaries that claim that \"Obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in American history\" and \"never has a politician in this land had such a quasi-religious impact on so many people\" and \"Obama is a narcissist,\" which leads the author to then compare Obama to David Koresh, Charles Manson, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. Excuse me while I blow my nose. This fellow has failed to notice that all politicians are narcissists \u2013 and that a recent American president was a world-class exponent of the imperial me. So what? Political egos are one of the reasons the Founders put checks and balances on executive power. As for serial lying, is there a politician that cannot be accused of that? And once, the same recent president set a pretty high bar in this category, and we survived it. As for Obama's speeches, they are hardly in the Huey Long, Louis Farrakhan, Fidel Castro vein. They are in fact eloquently and cleverly centrist and sober. So what's the panic? It is true that Obama has shown surprising ineptitude in his first months in office, but he's not a zero with no accomplishments as many conservatives seem to think -- unless you regard beating the Clinton machine and winning the presidency as nothing. But in doing this you fall into the \"Bush-is-an-idiot\" bag of liberal miasmas. It is also true Obama has ceded his domestic economic agenda to the House Democrats and spent a lot of money in the process. But what's the surprise in this? After all, Bush and McCain both proposed (and in Bush's case pushed through) massive government giveaways (which amount to government takeovers as well). This is bad, but it doesn't make Obama a closet Mussolini, however deplorable the conservatives among us may regard it. Moreover, he's already run into political resistance even within his own party. Charlie Rangel has made it clear that the itemized deduction tax hike is not going through his committee -- and that should tell you that the American system, the one the Founders created, is still in place. Even as astute a conservative thinker as Mark Steyn has been swept up in the tide that thinks Obama is a \"transformative\" radical. But look again at his approach to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, as noted, he is carrying out the Bush policies -- the same that he once joined his fellow Democrats in condemning. And that should be reassuring to anyone concerned about where he is heading as commander in chief. In other words, while it's reasonable to be unhappy with a Democratic administration and even concerned because the Democrats are now a socialist party in the European sense, we are not witnessing the coming of the antichrist. A good strategy for political conflicts is to understand your opponent first -- not to underestimate him, but not to overestimate him either. Once conservatives do that, they will find some silver linings in the first moves of the Obama administration. Through a combination of ineptitude and zeal, Obama has in two short months locked down the conservative and Republican base. On fetal stem-cell research, on borders (e-verification), on spending, on unions, on shutting down talk radio, Obama has flexed the leftist muscle so nakedly and unmistakably that there isn't a conservative left who will vote Democratic in the next election (and there were many who did so in the last). As we move forward, Obama faces increasingly tough choices in the wars against Islamic fascism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza and Iran. Hopefully, he will make the right choices, and should he do so conservatives will need to be there to support him. If he makes the wrong choices, conservatives will need to be there to oppose him. But neither our support nor our opposition should be based on hysterical responses to policies that we just don't like. Let's leave that kind of behavior to the liberals who invented it. This piece first appeared in FrontPage Magazine. Gee, a Conservative who is ALMOST 'fair and balanced'. heheheh",
