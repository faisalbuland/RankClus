Michael Mullen will be up on Capitol Hill several times this week to talk to lawmakers about the proposed 2010 defense budget. The first hearing is this morning, and you can watch it live through the House Armed Services Committee's web site. Don't expect any large revelations from the hearings -- we already know which major weapons systems are on the chopping block, the size of the pay raise for next year, and the increased focus on Afghanistan. But how Congress reacts to what Gates' emphasizes this week and what he doesn't discuss could have a major impact on what lawmakers focus on for the rest of the summer, as they pick apart every page of the $664 billion proposal. So here are a few key points to look for: ** Which doomed weapons systems get the most attention? Lawmakers with defense contractors in their districts will be fighting to protect jobs. But if the committees as a whole start reconsidering cuts to a particular system -- The Army's FCS vehicles? The F-22? -- it could become a summer-long fight for the defense department to justify those decisions. ** Who isn't getting a bonus this year? The Defense Department will slash nearly 10 percent from its specialty pay funds under the budget proposal, along with other steep cuts in recruiting and retention incentives. Expect tough questions from the subcommittees for the service cheifs about which troops will lose out on money and how that might hurt end strength numbers in coming years. ** What about Don't Ask, Don't Tell? In past years the defense budget has also been used as a vehicle for Pentagon policy changes, such as the decision last year to include transferability of military education benefits to spouses and children of troops. The House already has legislation waiting to overturn the military's ban on openly-gay servicemembers. Will lawmakers decide to force the president to deal with the issue this year? ** How much more can be added? Congress isn't usually shy about tacking on extra funds for pet projects or underfunded priorities. But the White House has billed this defense budget as a fiscally responsible one for fiscally challenging times. Will the Pentagon actively lobby against even more money for MRAPs, body armor research, and other extras that lawmakers might want? ** Will they get it done on time? For now, leaders on Capitol Hill are optimistic that the defense budget can be approved by Oct. 1, and signed into law without any interruption in defense funds. They've done well in recent years in reaching that goal, but usually lawmakers begin this process in mid-April. A month-long delay probably won't hurt too much, but if the budget debates stretch into December -- and they have in the past -- it could mean delayed bonuses, pay raises and a host of other headaches.",
