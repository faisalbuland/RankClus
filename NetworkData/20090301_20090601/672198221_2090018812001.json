I live in a small town between Westover AFB at Westover, MA and the commercial airport serving CT. So we have noise from military and civiian aircraft daily. Depending upon flight paths, some days we do not see or hear any aircraft except in the distance. Under the right weather conditions, we can hear aircraft engine noise rumbling through the valley. Naturally, some people who live closer to either station the noise is more of a problem to them. But at public hearings, I'm always amazed by people who bought a home located near either station and who are attending the meeting complaining about aircraft noise! Did they think because they moved into the area things would suddenly stop to ease their complaints about noise? Frankly, I love seeing the C5's and other military aircraft flying overhead...CH53's, UH60's, CH47's, you name it...it's great to know people are training to cover the backs of my family and friends. The commercial aircraft...that's great also...commerce, jobs, helping the local and state economy. I say to the cry babies in Virginia...move if you don't like the noise and quit wasting the taxpayers money, my money to cover their own stupidity. S/F Gordon",

At Dover, people would move into houses and/or a trailer park just north of the perimeter fence, then complain when engines were run. What?

However, the local press had a field day over it. One idiot found out the wing CC's phone number and published it. The base was originally well outside the center of population, but the area grew up around it. Some much for smart planning.

I live in a small town between Westover AFB at Westover, MA and the commercial airport serving CT. So we have noise from military and civiian aircraft daily. Depending upon flight paths, some days we do not see or hear any aircraft except in the distance. Under the right weather conditions, we can hear aircraft engine noise rumbling through the valley. Naturally, some people who live closer to either station the noise is more of a problem to them. But at public hearings, I'm always amazed by people who bought a home located near either station and who are attending the meeting complaining about aircraft noise! Did they think because they moved into the area things would suddenly stop to ease their complaints about noise? Frankly, I love seeing the C5's and other military aircraft flying overhead...CH53's, UH60's, CH47's, you name it...it's great to know people are training to cover the backs of my family and friends. The commercial aircraft...that's great also...commerce, jobs, helping the local and state economy. I say to the cry babies in Virginia...move if you don't like the noise and quit wasting the taxpayers money, my money to cover their own stupidity. S/F Gordon",

I live in a small town between Westover AFB at Westover, MA and the commercial airport serving CT. So we have noise from military and civiian aircraft daily. Depending upon flight paths, some days we do not see or hear any aircraft except in the distance. Under the right weather conditions, we can hear aircraft engine noise rumbling through the valley. Naturally, some people who live closer to either station the noise is more of a problem to them. But at public hearings, I'm always amazed by people who bought a home located near either station and who are attending the meeting complaining about aircraft noise! Did they think because they moved into the area things would suddenly stop to ease their complaints about noise? Frankly, I love seeing the C5's and other military aircraft flying overhead...CH53's, UH60's, CH47's, you name it...it's great to know people are training to cover the backs of my family and friends. The commercial aircraft...that's great also...commerce, jobs, helping the local and state economy. I say to the cry babies in Virginia...move if you don't like the noise and quit wasting the taxpayers money, my money to cover their own stupidity. S/F Gordon",

It's cool to see some black hawks flying at high speed low over the houses but at 3am at night it can get annoying. yea but i lived in the middle of a major city so I Dont complain about it i enjoy the fly by's but it does get annoying at times when they do flyby's at the dead of night. Then you shouldn't live there... I live within fifteen miles of one military airfield and thirty-five from another... When the atmospherics are right, I get the rumble from aircraft on the line, when they are \"turned\" for maintenance, from the closest one and I get fly overs from both and there have been times late at night, when we've had CH-54s fly low, fast and blacked out, over our house, IT'S GREAT!... The cat dives for cover, the dogs go nuts, the windows rattle, the wife looks annoyed and I dive out the front door to get a look, GREAT!... I wish that I was a young man again and in that crew, I love it!... Dedicated crews, brilliantly trained and flying for the safety of the nation and my family, THANK YOU!... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 i live in a major city and i love the fly by's but at night when your in deep sleep and the house start shakeing it gets pretty freaken scary. Just tell your Mrs, \"Baby, you still make the earth move for me!\"... Heck, if I had the choice and they still flew B-36s, I'd live near an Air Force Base from which they operated, I love it and I guess I always will, I guess I'm sorta strange that way... I love aircraft, their sights, sounds, smells and those that work and crew them... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
