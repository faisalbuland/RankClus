By PETER BAKER, NY Times Published: April 13, 2009 WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama vowed Monday to \u201chalt the rise of piracy\u201d off the coast of Africa following the dramatic rescue of an American merchant captain, foreshadowing a longer and potentially more treacherous struggle ahead as he weighs a series of problematic options. With the \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d episode in Somalia in 1993, where two American helicopters were shot down and 18 American soldiers were killed, still in the American consciousness, Mr. Obama and his advisers are wary of becoming deeply involved in the region again. That wariness comes at a time when Mr. Obama is already trying end a war in Iraq and win another in Afghanistan. \u201cAll I can tell you is I am confident we will be spending a lot of time in the Situation Room over the next few weeks trying to figure out what in the world to do about this problem,\u201d Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told students and faculty members at the Marine Corps War College in Quantico, Va., according to a military news service. One friggin victory and Obama is a war hero.",

Don't know what BO had to do with the entire effort but he did not 'screw up' the Navy's mission and his remarks do appear that he was on top of the situation. He didn't do the 'Republican thing' or the 'Democratic thing'; he did the American thing (not back off because of threats, etc.). I've listened to a number of commentators saying either he waited too long or his 'allowing' the Navy to use \"deadly force\" will cause dire consequences to the shipping, travel, and foreign diplomacy but what I \"know\" is that he has sent a message that you don't 'mess' (or stronger term) with the USA! Piracy like terrorism is a threat not only to the US but to the world and the big kid on the block has said \"We Have Had Enough!\" ... and our Navy hasn't really had a Sea battle since WWII.

Don't know what BO had to do with the entire effort but he did not 'screw up' the Navy's mission and his remarks do appear that he was on top of the situation. He didn't do the 'Republican thing' or the 'Democratic thing'; he did the American thing (not back off because of threats, etc.). I've listened to a number of commentators saying either he waited too long or his 'allowing' the Navy to use \"deadly force\" will cause dire consequences to the shipping, travel, and foreign diplomacy but what I \"know\" is that he has sent a message that you don't 'mess' (or stronger term) with the USA! Piracy like terrorism is a threat not only to the US but to the world and the big kid on the block has said \"We Have Had Enough!\" ... and our Navy hasn't really had a Sea battle since WWII. Any bets on how a Pirate ship will fare against one of our ships ?",
