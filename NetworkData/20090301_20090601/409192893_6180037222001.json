Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America.

Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america? It's a good day for...the gays and that's all. What state is to fall to their agenda next I wonder?",

Referring to the founding fathers get you nothing as we can't ask them their thoughts on the subject but since at the time the founding fathers were though as people who were non-religious according to the more fundment religious types of the time I'm sure they could have suprised you, but since we can't ask them, we must stay in this time period.

This \"argument\" has the following form: Event X has occurred (or will or might occur). Therefore event Y will inevitably happen. This sort of \"reasoning\" is fallacious because there is no reason to believe that one event must inevitably follow from another without an argument for such a claim. This is especially clear in cases in which there is a significant number of steps or gradations between one event and another. \"",

The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage.

It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america?

Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere...

Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america? It's a good day for...the gays and that's all. What state is to fall to their agenda next I wonder?",

Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today...",

I can only hope you're being sarcastic, but considering some of the posts I've seen on these boards, I'm willing to guess no.

Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america? It's a good day for...the gays and that's all. What state is to fall to their agenda next I wonder?",

Now consider: A racist guy beats the crap out of a black guy just BECAUSE he is black. Not only is he guilty of that assault, but because he committed this crime based on a demographic and not the individual, he is a lot more likely to do the same thing again. Hence, a stronger sentence in the hopes it gives him more time to think about how bad an idea it would be to do this again for whatever reason. Just for the S&G factor, isn't this guy's right to be a racist, just because he wants to be. Hasn't it been proven in a court of law that his racist speech is protected under the 1st Amendment?? Where is it the \"black\" person's right to have time added onto the racist's sentence just because he is a racist? Would the \"black\" person get extra time on his sentence if he beat the racist, just because he is a racist?? I would say \"white\" except you didn't, and racist's come in lots of different colors.",

The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow.

One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere...

The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage.

It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america?

Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere...

Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america? It's a good day for...the gays and that's all. What state is to fall to their agenda next I wonder?",

Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today...",

I moved to Massachusetts in 1986 from the Colorado Springs, Colorado area - the home of James Dobson's Focus On The family - an organization that has been working hard since it was created to \"curtail freedom\". In the 23 years I have lived in Massachusetts, I haven't noticed as much \"curtailing of my freedom\" as I noticed during the last few years I was living in the Colorado Springs, Colorado area. I now live in a small town with a town meeting government and a strong streak of libertarianism.",

As a black minister recently observed: \"I have met former gay people but never a former black person\".

Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America.

Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america? It's a good day for...the gays and that's all. What state is to fall to their agenda next I wonder?",

Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere...

Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, could veto the bill, The New York Times writes. The Catholic Diocese of Maine and the Maine Family Policy Council, an affiliate of the Family Research Council, will be among the groups lobbying Mr. Baldacci to veto the bill. Mr. Baldacci opposed same-sex marriage before the bill was introduced this year, but he has since said he is keeping an open mind. Mr. Baldacci\u2019s spokesman, David Farmer, said he was still mulling his position on the bill and would not make a final decision until after it reached his desk. That could be as soon as tomorrow, when the State Senate is scheduled to formally enact it. Mr. Baldacci will have 10 days to act on the bill once it is delivered to him. The D.C. Council also voted today to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The New Hampshire House is expected to take up the bill at tomorrow. In case you've lost track, Maine would join Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in legalizing same-sex marriage. Update: Maine Governor John Baldacci signed the bill today legalizing same-sex marriage. From posters comments to the above story from Christianity Today quote: The governor signed the legislation, as he should have. It's a good day in America, as we too slowly move to live up to our highest ideals of citizen equality... New England was settled by those seeking freedom. Glad to see we still believe in it. Heterosexual marriage will not suffer and the world will not end, you'll see... One can only hope that the hateful, bigoted remarks of Joe the Plumber in his interview with CT posted earlier this week, which were widely reported and linked to in the blogosphere and on MSNBC, played some small role in encouraging the governor of Maine, who had previously opposed marriage equality, to say \"enough is enough\" - this a matter of fundamental fairness and equal protection of the laws, and to change his mind to sign the marriage equality legislation into law. Or, that the nastiness of the pro-Proposition 8 campaigners in California created a backlash in favor of marriage equality as decent people from Iowa to Vermont to Maine to DC are recognizing that they must stand up against bigotry, because if the forces of bigotry can prevail in liberal, live-and-let-live California, they can prevail anywhwere... The New England colonies led the American people in 1775 at the battles of Lexington and Concord to overthrow the rule of the English monarchy and establish what became the United States of America. New England still leads the battle for freedom today... Don't care for idiots that say \"it's a good day for America\". Who gave them the right to speak for the majority, for \"all\" america? It's a good day for...the gays and that's all. What state is to fall to their agenda next I wonder?",

        "reply": " Nope, I didn't. Referring to the founding fathers get you nothing as we can't ask them their thoughts on the subject but since at the time the founding fathers were though as people who were non-religious according to the more fundment religious types of the time I'm sure they could have suprised you, but since we can't ask them, we must stay in this time period. So I answered to real point.",

Just for the S&G factor, isn't this guy's right to be a racist, just because he wants to be. Hasn't it been proven in a court of law that his racist speech is protected under the 1st Amendment?? Where is it the \"black\" person's right to have time added onto the racist's sentence just because he is a racist? Would the \"black\" person get extra time on his sentence if he beat the racist, just because he is a racist?? I would say \"white\" except you didn't, and racist's come in lots of different colors.",
