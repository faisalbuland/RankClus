Duster, you and me are in the same boat, I guess - - Well the way I see this whole mess, people are running around like chickens with their heads cut off out of fear they lost 10 trillion dollars. Well, ya can't lose something ya never had - - Let me explain it this way: I got a 15 year old pickup sitting outside. Let's pretend that is America's economy, based upon layer after layer of debt borrowed against debt infinitum - stay with me.... Now, when I bought that truck in 1994 (Ford F-250 extended cab 4x4 Turbo Diesel), it cost me about $30,000.00. It was one of the first of its kind, with an International Harvester Direct Injection 7.3 Liter V-8 Diesel, so now I think I've got a \"Collector's Item,\" and in my mind, it has appreciated in value to $90,000.00 - I'm rich!! In 15 years, I have tripled my money just by hanging on to it.!! The Stock Market was below 10,000 back in the 90s, right? Well, just over a year ago, it was rocketing towards 15,000, right?? Everybody was rich, right?? Based on what??? NOTHING!!! So now I take my truck down town and try to sell it for $80,000.00! Why be greedy, right? Besides it's showing a little smidge of rust here and there. When the Stock Market passed 14,000 and the price of gas hit $5.00 a gallon, didn't people start warning about all the debt upon debt that banks had, and the phony bubble being created by oil speculation? But everybody kept throwing their savings at the speculators to get in on the tidal wave of riches! Well, nobody wants my truck for 80K or 70K or 60K or even the original 30K, because newer pickups are everywhere! In fact, as gooda shape as it's in, I'd be lucky to get $5,000.00 for it, but its worth that, because it's a good truck, and I really never lost anything at all, I got 15 years and 160,000 miles out of it, and may double that. So I personally enjoyed every minute of the depreciation. Well, the Stock MArket is plummeting down through all the fantasies and BS until it hits a point where it will reflect the REAL value of what stuff is worth. If something is worthless and phony, it will zero out, like all our 401Ks, IRAs, Stocks, and other paper trash we were fooled into or forced into buying for retirements. Everybody in the government from the Reagen era through Clintoon to Bush ought to be going to jail right along with MAdoff for scamming us so bad, but we were all idiots for allowing it, and got what we deserved! A fool and his money are soon parted - Ben Franklin Pretty stupid, aren't we all!? But like being at a Carnival, we all been enjoying the cheap thrill rides until they all broke down and killed a few people - So waht have we got to complain about??? \"American-UP!!\" Quit crying, get up off the ground, dust off, and get after it - - Hell, my forefathers got beat up, shot at, burnt out and kicked out right here on this continent. They threw together whatever was left, pioneered their way to Utah, cut farms and ranches out of the wilderness and started over. Can't Americans still do any of that right where they stand??

Okay - Here's the bad deal about credit cards: About 1/3 of the people who have them won't pay what they owe on them, and the stores and utilities and everybody who does business KNOWS this! These dead-beat credit card users are also the ones who will get 10-20 cards to max them out.

So how DO they make a profit, with all this thievery and book-keeping slight of hand taking place, so they have something to put in their own bank accounts? Well, they get a pair of gym shoes made in Bangladesh by kids for $3.00 and sell them to you for $100.00 or $150.00! The same is true for everything you buy in some way or another. That way, if you are an honest person who pays for everything you buy...YOU are paying ALL the inflated difference between the REAL value of the product all the LOSSES the merchant may incur because of ALL the thievery!

Duster, you and me are in the same boat, I guess - - Well the way I see this whole mess, people are running around like chickens with their heads cut off out of fear they lost 10 trillion dollars. Well, ya can't lose something ya never had - - Let me explain it this way: I got a 15 year old pickup sitting outside. Let's pretend that is America's economy, based upon layer after layer of debt borrowed against debt infinitum - stay with me.... Now, when I bought that truck in 1994 (Ford F-250 extended cab 4x4 Turbo Diesel), it cost me about $30,000.00. It was one of the first of its kind, with an International Harvester Direct Injection 7.3 Liter V-8 Diesel, so now I think I've got a \"Collector's Item,\" and in my mind, it has appreciated in value to $90,000.00 - I'm rich!! In 15 years, I have tripled my money just by hanging on to it.!! The Stock Market was below 10,000 back in the 90s, right? Well, just over a year ago, it was rocketing towards 15,000, right?? Everybody was rich, right?? Based on what??? NOTHING!!! So now I take my truck down town and try to sell it for $80,000.00! Why be greedy, right? Besides it's showing a little smidge of rust here and there. When the Stock Market passed 14,000 and the price of gas hit $5.00 a gallon, didn't people start warning about all the debt upon debt that banks had, and the phony bubble being created by oil speculation? But everybody kept throwing their savings at the speculators to get in on the tidal wave of riches! Well, nobody wants my truck for 80K or 70K or 60K or even the original 30K, because newer pickups are everywhere! In fact, as gooda shape as it's in, I'd be lucky to get $5,000.00 for it, but its worth that, because it's a good truck, and I really never lost anything at all, I got 15 years and 160,000 miles out of it, and may double that. So I personally enjoyed every minute of the depreciation. Well, the Stock MArket is plummeting down through all the fantasies and BS until it hits a point where it will reflect the REAL value of what stuff is worth. If something is worthless and phony, it will zero out, like all our 401Ks, IRAs, Stocks, and other paper trash we were fooled into or forced into buying for retirements. Everybody in the government from the Reagen era through Clintoon to Bush ought to be going to jail right along with MAdoff for scamming us so bad, but we were all idiots for allowing it, and got what we deserved! A fool and his money are soon parted - Ben Franklin Pretty stupid, aren't we all!? But like being at a Carnival, we all been enjoying the cheap thrill rides until they all broke down and killed a few people - So waht have we got to complain about??? \"American-UP!!\" Quit crying, get up off the ground, dust off, and get after it - - Hell, my forefathers got beat up, shot at, burnt out and kicked out right here on this continent. They threw together whatever was left, pioneered their way to Utah, cut farms and ranches out of the wilderness and started over. Can't Americans still do any of that right where they stand??

It was one of the first of its kind, with an International Harvester Direct Injection 7.3 Liter V-8 Diesel, so now I think I've got a \"Collector's Item,\" and in my mind, it has appreciated in value to $90,000.00 - I'm rich!! In 15 years, I have tripled my money just by hanging on to it.!! The Stock Market was below 10,000 back in the 90s, right? Well, just over a year ago, it was rocketing towards 15,000, right?? Everybody was rich, right?? Based on what??? NOTHING!!! So now I take my truck down town and try to sell it for $80,000.00! Why be greedy, right? Besides it's showing a little smidge of rust here and there. When the Stock Market passed 14,000 and the price of gas hit $5.00 a gallon, didn't people start warning about all the debt upon debt that banks had, and the phony bubble being created by oil speculation? But everybody kept throwing their savings at the speculators to get in on the tidal wave of riches! Well, nobody wants my truck for 80K or 70K or 60K or even the original 30K, because newer pickups are everywhere! In fact, as gooda shape as it's in, I'd be lucky to get $5,000.00 for it, but its worth that, because it's a good truck, and I really never lost anything at all, I got 15 years and 160,000 miles out of it, and may double that. So I personally enjoyed every minute of the depreciation. Well, the Stock MArket is plummeting down through all the fantasies and BS until it hits a point where it will reflect the REAL value of what stuff is worth. If something is worthless and phony, it will zero out, like all our 401Ks, IRAs, Stocks, and other paper trash we were fooled into or forced into buying for retirements. Everybody in the government from the Reagen era through Clintoon to Bush ought to be going to jail right along with MAdoff for scamming us so bad, but we were all idiots for allowing it, and got what we deserved! A fool and his money are soon parted - Ben Franklin Pretty stupid, aren't we all!? But like being at a Carnival, we all been enjoying the cheap thrill rides until they all broke down and killed a few people - So waht have we got to complain about??? \"American-UP!!\" Quit crying, get up off the ground, dust off, and get after it - - Hell, my forefathers got beat up, shot at, burnt out and kicked out right here on this continent. They threw together whatever was left, pioneered their way to Utah, cut farms and ranches out of the wilderness and started over. Can't Americans still do any of that right where they stand?? Make do with what ya got, and get on with it - - Wandering and Wondering",

Let's pretend that is America's economy, based upon layer after layer of debt borrowed against debt infinitum - stay with me.... Now, when I bought that truck in 1994 (Ford F-250 extended cab 4x4 Turbo Diesel), it cost me about $30,000.00. It was one of the first of its kind, with an International Harvester Direct Injection 7.3 Liter V-8 Diesel, so now I think I've got a \"Collector's Item,\" and in my mind, it has appreciated in value to $90,000.00 - I'm rich!! In 15 years, I have tripled my money just by hanging on to it.!! The Stock Market was below 10,000 back in the 90s, right? Well, just over a year ago, it was rocketing towards 15,000, right?? Everybody was rich, right?? Based on what??? NOTHING!!! So now I take my truck down town and try to sell it for $80,000.00! Why be greedy, right? Besides it's showing a little smidge of rust here and there. When the Stock Market passed 14,000 and the price of gas hit $5.00 a gallon, didn't people start warning about all the debt upon debt that banks had, and the phony bubble being created by oil speculation? But everybody kept throwing their savings at the speculators to get in on the tidal wave of riches! Well, nobody wants my truck for 80K or 70K or 60K or even the original 30K, because newer pickups are everywhere! In fact, as gooda shape as it's in, I'd be lucky to get $5,000.00 for it, but its worth that, because it's a good truck, and I really never lost anything at all, I got 15 years and 160,000 miles out of it, and may double that. So I personally enjoyed every minute of the depreciation. Well, the Stock MArket is plummeting down through all the fantasies and BS until it hits a point where it will reflect the REAL value of what stuff is worth. If something is worthless and phony, it will zero out, like all our 401Ks, IRAs, Stocks, and other paper trash we were fooled into or forced into buying for retirements. Everybody in the government from the Reagen era through Clintoon to Bush ought to be going to jail right along with MAdoff for scamming us so bad, but we were all idiots for allowing it, and got what we deserved! A fool and his money are soon parted - Ben Franklin Pretty stupid, aren't we all!? But like being at a Carnival, we all been enjoying the cheap thrill rides until they all broke down and killed a few people - So waht have we got to complain about??? \"American-UP!!\" Quit crying, get up off the ground, dust off, and get after it - - Hell, my forefathers got beat up, shot at, burnt out and kicked out right here on this continent. They threw together whatever was left, pioneered their way to Utah, cut farms and ranches out of the wilderness and started over. Can't Americans still do any of that right where they stand??

THAT is why a $3.00 pair of sneakers cost you $100.00, a $5.00 pair of Levis cost you $100.00, a $5,000.00 pickup costs you $40,000.00, and a $25,000.00 home costs you $500,000.00 - which compound interest yearly will run up to 2 MILLION over 30 years, if you live long enough to pay it off and see the deed - - And THAT is why this country is in the toilet in a nut shell - - Be frugal, DEMAND a better price or walk out, and pay with CASH on everything you can - That may turn some of this around - - Wandering and Wondering",

Now if I could learn to make my own shoes, sew my own pants, build my own Pickup and build a house, I can save $510,098.00 plus interest, which we all know is more than the principal when all is said and done. Maybe going to a barter system would work, you build my shoes and I can build your truck. That's a lot of shoes ain't it? Nope the only way to make it work is to just save for it if you NEED it. Emphasis on NEED? Look at what people spend on just some of the toys they accumulate. Thousands for a boat, thousands for a jet ski, thousands for a vehicle they can only ride on special occasions and sunny days. Some people change there couch out every year! Furniture stores love to see a big car pull up. Even in the groceries stores they buy pre-prepared items that they could make cheaper and healthier at home with the fresh ingredients. I think people are going to learn these skills more and more in the near future. Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
