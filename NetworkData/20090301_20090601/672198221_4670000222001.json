Why not just retire Arlen? I still can't get over your mismanagement of the Judiciary Committee? How you both acted as chairman of the committee, and advocate for the minority, at the same time. You undermined your primary function, and not even beginning to comprehend the damage you did to the process. You obstructed those hearings more than any other. You allowed the harm that was done to those nominees. At least you are out of the closet now. I apologize for being harsh on you Arlen, had you resigned from your chairmanship, and advocated your position as a standing member of the committee, I would have still disagreed with your position, yet respected your voice. The system is broken, your dysfunction, a single piece of the machine. I'm sure ACORN has plenty of extortion money, and federally funded busses, to help you with your reelection effort. We all are going to have to grow up sometime. GOP needs to rediscover what it means to be a vertebrae. Why over react to DNC labeling and attacks? In 96, in 2000, we were accused of wanting to starve old people and throw them into the streets. So RNC leaders out spent the Dem's. What purpose did it serve? What did it prove? We are accused of hating minorities, Weren't Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King both Republicans? I can safely say that I hate injustice, Partiality in judgment, misrepresentation, and criminal intent to name a few. I support a federal standard, state controlled ballot system with equal voice to all legal ballots. Positive ID. How do we determine the consent of the governed when we cannot even credibly confirm their position on candidates or issues. State to state, county to county, the standards vary. From my personal perspective, this and the maintenance of it, falls into Governments primary responsibility in serving the People whom justify It's existence. Oregon, I salute your paper ballot. Credibility, Verifiability, Transparency, Disclosure. We need to stand on our own visions and message, not feed on DUNC controlled avenues in the false hope of being treated fairly. We are in dark times, small minds are calling the shots and they are either very incompetent or very evil. Hang onto your wallets. Low tide may get offensive, it is our time for hope and vision. Lets consider rejecting that which is unreliable. They stall momentum, undermine principle. We need to focus on vision and direction, and protect against that which would corrupt. Vote them out before they cost us our Republic.",
