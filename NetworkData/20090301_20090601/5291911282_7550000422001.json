I'm trying to find out whether I'm still qualified to get in. I have a misdemeanor battery from 1999. The original charge was a felony rape, but was later amended to a misdemeanor battery, because of lack of evidence. Then I have a misdemeanor DV-ASSULT W/INJURY. I was convicted of this in 11/2008 with 30days suspended jailtime, 2 years unsupervised probation and 26 weeks of DV classes. I'm attending DV classes till 6/22/09. Afterwards I'm goin back to court to get it set aside off my record and when it gets set off my record I should be off probation. Now this is my first and only DV offense. I know the military allows people to sign up if they have a felony and spent a short time in prison. Now if felons are able to get in with waiver, then why is it people that have a DV conviction have a hard time getting in. I've talked to a recruiter in Nebraska about 2 years ago and he told me the military doesn't allow people with DV's. Now ok if felons are able to carry guns then why is it they are able to enlist. Now I'm not trying to get all argumentive over this. I just want to know if I have the chance to get in and able to get some string pulled. I know recruiter are able to pull string with the government somehow. I'm honestly a pretty good guy. I've just gotten into a couple bad situation at the wrong time. So if someone can get back to be about this I would appreciate it.. Thanks.. Derrick",

You can NEVER be employed in a position that requires a firearm. It's BS. You know it and I know it. But there is no waiver for the Lautenberg Act - period. You're hosed. You can never join any part of the military. It is time to look elsewhere. My prayers and best wished to you. I'll ask God to bless you richly. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
