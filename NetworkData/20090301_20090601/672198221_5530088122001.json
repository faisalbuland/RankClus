(...) Sources in Rosoboronexport later confirmed that Russia and Vietnam had been negotiating a $1.8 billion deal on the delivery of six Kilo-class submarines to the Vietnamese navy for about a year. Admiralty Shipyards is currently building two Kilo class submarines for Algeria to be delivered in 2009 and 2010. Kilo class submarines, nicknamed \"Black Holes\" for their ability to avoid detection, are considered to be among the quietest diesel-electric submarines in the world. The submarine is designed for anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface-ship warfare, and also for general reconnaissance and patrol missions. The vessel has a displacement of 2,300 tons, a maximum depth of 350 meters (1,200 feet), a range of 6,000 miles, and a crew of 57. It is equipped with six 533-mm torpedo tubes. As of November 2006, 16 vessels were believed to be in active service with the Russian Navy and eight submarines were thought to be in reserve. Another 29 vessels have been exported to China, India, Iran, Poland, Romania and Algeria. Looks like the PLAN will have a new headache from Beijing's old adversary Hanoi.

In asserting its rights to the Spratly Islands also claimed by China, Vietnam has ordered six Project 636 Kilo-class submarines from Russia and has gotten permission for the purchase, in addition to other military arms Vietnam has ordered. (...) For some time, Vietnam has laid claim and occupies some 30 of the Spratly Islands which China also claims. The Spratlys aren't just a group of reefs, islets and islands in the South China Sea located between the Philippines and Vietnam. They also are the site of potentially significant oil and gas reserves and offer rich fishing grounds. Chinese surveys estimate that the Spratly area holds some 17.7 billion tons of oil and natural gas reserves compared to Kuwait's estimated 13 billion tons. In addition to China and Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also have staked claims on some of the islands. However, the issue of claims centers more on Vietnam and China. Indeed, the earliest activity of migration patterns originates out of present-day China and Vietnam, going back to 600 B.C. Even up until the 18th century, neither country was aware that the other had charted the islands and made claims to them. Yet, both countries have a history in which the Spratlys figure prominently. In 1988, China and Vietnam clashed over a portion of the Spratlys. Chinese gunboats sank Vietnamese armed transport ships attempting to land troops. In 1979, there was a bloody clash between the two countries that killed tens of thousands. After the U.S. pulled out of South Vietnam in 1975 and the North and South consolidated, Vietnam then developed closer ties with the Soviet Union. (...) According to analysts, Vietnam occupies more than 20 bases in the Spratly group of islands, even more than China or any other claimant to the island group. Not only do the islands have a seabed with potentially large oil and gas reserves, they straddle vital shipping lanes. China has oil fields in the north while Vietnam is developing fields in the south of the island group. At present, Vietnam has two Yugo-class midget submarines transferred from North Korea in 1997. For years, Vietnam has been trying to obtain the Kilo submarine to enlarge its fleet, since this particular class of Russian sub is considered to be one of the stealthiest. In fact, defense experts said that the Kilos have an ability to avoid detection and are designed for anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare. ++http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=99573",

(...) Sources in Rosoboronexport later confirmed that Russia and Vietnam had been negotiating a $1.8 billion deal on the delivery of six Kilo-class submarines to the Vietnamese navy for about a year. Admiralty Shipyards is currently building two Kilo class submarines for Algeria to be delivered in 2009 and 2010. Kilo class submarines, nicknamed \"Black Holes\" for their ability to avoid detection, are considered to be among the quietest diesel-electric submarines in the world. The submarine is designed for anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface-ship warfare, and also for general reconnaissance and patrol missions. The vessel has a displacement of 2,300 tons, a maximum depth of 350 meters (1,200 feet), a range of 6,000 miles, and a crew of 57. It is equipped with six 533-mm torpedo tubes. As of November 2006, 16 vessels were believed to be in active service with the Russian Navy and eight submarines were thought to be in reserve. Another 29 vessels have been exported to China, India, Iran, Poland, Romania and Algeria. Looks like the PLAN will have a new headache from Beijing's old adversary Hanoi.

In asserting its rights to the Spratly Islands also claimed by China, Vietnam has ordered six Project 636 Kilo-class submarines from Russia and has gotten permission for the purchase, in addition to other military arms Vietnam has ordered. (...) For some time, Vietnam has laid claim and occupies some 30 of the Spratly Islands which China also claims. The Spratlys aren't just a group of reefs, islets and islands in the South China Sea located between the Philippines and Vietnam. They also are the site of potentially significant oil and gas reserves and offer rich fishing grounds. Chinese surveys estimate that the Spratly area holds some 17.7 billion tons of oil and natural gas reserves compared to Kuwait's estimated 13 billion tons. In addition to China and Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also have staked claims on some of the islands. However, the issue of claims centers more on Vietnam and China. Indeed, the earliest activity of migration patterns originates out of present-day China and Vietnam, going back to 600 B.C. Even up until the 18th century, neither country was aware that the other had charted the islands and made claims to them. Yet, both countries have a history in which the Spratlys figure prominently. In 1988, China and Vietnam clashed over a portion of the Spratlys. Chinese gunboats sank Vietnamese armed transport ships attempting to land troops. In 1979, there was a bloody clash between the two countries that killed tens of thousands. After the U.S. pulled out of South Vietnam in 1975 and the North and South consolidated, Vietnam then developed closer ties with the Soviet Union. (...) According to analysts, Vietnam occupies more than 20 bases in the Spratly group of islands, even more than China or any other claimant to the island group. Not only do the islands have a seabed with potentially large oil and gas reserves, they straddle vital shipping lanes. China has oil fields in the north while Vietnam is developing fields in the south of the island group. At present, Vietnam has two Yugo-class midget submarines transferred from North Korea in 1997. For years, Vietnam has been trying to obtain the Kilo submarine to enlarge its fleet, since this particular class of Russian sub is considered to be one of the stealthiest.

Dude, I don't want to be a pedant or anything, but that doesn't make sense. Why would you title the thread after a follow up link, rather than the one you opened the thread with? Did you rename the thread after posting the second (non live) link? Annnnnyway, enough of that... ALthough the question is no longer aimed at you, I think the comment still stands. When the media refer to allies, we talk about 'military build-up', while enemies or 'others' tend to 'gear up for war', etc. Otherwise, pretty interesting situation there with the islands and the oil therein. I guess there'll be blood spilled over them at some stage in the next fifty years... - This message has been edited. Last edited by: stillkit, Mon 01 June 2009 04:16 AM",
