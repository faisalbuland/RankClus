        "content": "quote: Gary Owens The Man and the Moment WE WERE SOLDIERS does not try to tell the whole story. It focuses on one battle in a valley in Western South Vietnam fought by the GARY OWENS BRIGADE, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, against a purported North Vietnamese Division in the early part of the war 1965. The story does not begin in battle but in training of the Air Cavalry inside the US in a training programme designed to adjust Cavalry tactics to the age of the helicopter. The choice for command is LTC Moore (Mel Gibson). The name for the new fighting force is the GARY OWENS Brigade, famed for having been wiped out in combat with the Sioux Indians. However as deployment is implemented the President decides against declaring an emergency which will freeze enlistments. Thus the battalion goes into action at about half strength without adequate intelligence as to enemy strengths and dispositions. Colonel Moore is a mountain of a man willing to make every sacrifice and endure every hardship. However the movie subtlely details the obstacles the Colonel faces. No one speaks Vietnamese other than a South Vietnamese Ranger seen briefly interrogating a captive. No one knows enemy strengths. No one except seemingly Colonel Moore knows that the Viet Minh defeated the French in approximately the same location and under similar conditions. Everything about the proposed operation is thrown together. There aren't enough choppers to carry the whole attacking force in one swoop. The first wave will have to wait almost an hour for backup. A Moment To Reflect There is a moment to reflect as the troops board the steel mounts for combat. The breeze of the swishing rotors hides a Gaelic War Cry blending the furies into song. How is it that Gaelic melodies so easily lend themselves to War? The engagement itself breaches a canon of strategy: never plan an attack without securing your staging area. The landing zone (LZ) is quickly overrun by enemy forces compelling Colonel Moore to improvise another site. As battle is joined Higher Headquarters waffles. The brass even General Westmoreland want to recall Moore the trained tactician and to send in a brevetted replacement. Moore ignores the order and fights on with the men. Certainly the vignette explains the many brevetted commissions from that war. Were other real life commanders as faithful to the unit and to the men as the story makes claim for Colonel Moore? Who can be sure? Fighting is toe-to-toe and nose-to-nose. A napalm strike hits US forces. Ultimate success in a temporal sense is won for the Americans who by the touch of a feather put the Viet Cong to flight. The cost to the US is frightful. Nearly half the Gary Owens brigade and almost all of its officers except Colonel Moore have been killed. General DeGaulle, then President of France, remarked caustically, Americans have learned little from our mistakes. But with all the victories of Vietnam, though the field is won, it is quickly evacuated and left to the enemy. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore, the Colonel's wife, to whom the dirtiest task of the war has been left by the Army, that of informing nearly all other officers' wives of husbands' death in combat. If Veterans stayed away having first hand knowledge of the cost of war, this movie would be a good one for those whose patriotism is newly found in the politically correct response to current emergencies. source-http://www.angelfire.com/bc/RPPS/movie_reviews/war_movies/we_were_soldiers.htm",

The 87th Foot (Royal Irish Fusiliers) in particular is recorded as using it in the Peninsular but it was also used by a number of other regiments including the 50th \"Queen's Own\" Foot and possibly the 88th Conaught Rangers. It was also later used by a number of English \"Irish\" Territorial regiments such as the London Irish and the Liverpool Irish (VC and bar winner Noelle Chevasse mentions it). Ultimately it was the march of the 18th Foot, later Royal Irish Regiment (the first founding, disbanded in 1922). As a cavalry tune it seems to have been adopted by the 5th Royal Irish Lancers (5th RIL) raised in 1858 but this regiment was the second to bear that number, the first, the 5th Royal Irish Dragoons was disbanded in 1799 after allegations of treason during the 1798 Rising and it's unclear whether the original 5th Dragoons used Garryowen. Legend has it that the tune came to the US 7th Cavalry from a former officer in the 5th RIL but considering that the song was very popular during the Crimean War a decade or so before the US Civil War it could have been any number of emigrant British soldiers who carried it or just as likely a member of the Irish diaspora. Wikipedia also has it being used by the 69th Infantry Regiment from New York which appears to have been largely found of Irish Republican emigres so no shortage of ex-redcoats there. . (I was interested to learn that the National Guard appears to have a much better developed Regimental System than the US regulars BTW). Oh and a garyowen is also a tactic in Rugby Union named after the Garryowen Club from Limerick (a region of which city it's named after). It involves punting the ball high over the opposition's line in the hope that you'll be able to catch it again on the other side having avoided being tackled through not holding the ball.",

I have also seen it spelled with two 'r' s as in Garry Owen. The area of Limerick is spelled Garryowen so I suppose that must be right. Wikipedia suggests though that it's a corruption of the Irish words garrai (garden) and E\u00f3ghan (a name apparently meaning \"born of the yew tree\") although I've seen garrai used as a surname.",

        "content": "Garry Owen = \"Owen's Garden\" - a section of the town of Limerick in Ireland. The song was popular with more than just the Irish units. Many British Cavalry regiments adopted the song as it was one of the few songs whose tempo allowed it to be used when passing in review either mounted or dismounted. It was in fact a visiting British Cavalry officer who first introduced George Custer to the song during the Civil War while they were both in the Army of the Potomac (the British Officer was an observer). Custer adopted it as his own personal favorite and when given the command of the 7th, made it the regimental song. There were many Irishmen in the regiment, so it wasn't that hard of a sell. The song reportably was sung by the 11th Hussars (under Lord Cardigan) during the charge of the Light Brigade. It has been adopted by the entire US Cavalry, but only the unit crest of the 7th Cavalry has 'Garry Owen' as it's motto. Let Bacchus' sons be not dismayed But join with me, each jovial blade Come, drink and sing and lend your aid To help me with the chorus: Chorus: Instead of spa, we'll drink brown ale And pay the reckoning on the nail; No man for debt shall go to jail From Garryowen in glory. We are the boys who take delight In smashing Limerick lamps at night, And through the street like sportsters fight, Tearing all before us Instead of spa, we'll drink brown ale And pay the reckoning on the nail; No man for debt shall go to jail From Garryowen in glory.
