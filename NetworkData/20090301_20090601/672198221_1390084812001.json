Despite their deliberations at the time, the Treasury and Fed officials, which were part of the Bush Administration, eventually decided to restrict compensation on just the top 75 company executives--and some of them may still have received hefty bonuses... Many of the Treasury e-mails sent in November discuss compensation at AIG, particularly for top executives, including compensation for CEO Edward Liddy, a former insurance-company executive who agreed to take the top job at the company in September. \u201cDo you/Treasury want to be involved in helping design/discuss Ed Liddy\u2019s comp package?\u201d one e-mail said on Nov 25. In November, AIG announced that Liddy would receive an annual base salary of $1 for 2008 and 2009. The rest of his compensation, the company said, would consist of \u201cequity grants.\u201d He also would not receive bonuses for 2008 and 2009, \u201calthough he may be eligible for a special bonus for extraordinary performance payable in 2010,\u201d AIG said. It also said he would not be eligible for severance payments. In its negotiations with government officials in November, AIG submitted a \u201ccompensation proposal\u201d to them, the e-mails indicate. The emails also indicate compensation provisions were changed several times. One e-mail, from a law firm that worked on the transaction, stated, \u201cPlease find attached our comments to the compensation-specific provisions\u2026In a few instances, we have added comments to explain the thinking behind certain changes.\u201d In another e-mail, a person working on the transaction wrote, \u201cWe should get the term sheet to the company this morning. Because the comp section is still in real flux, we will take the content out of the draft to AIG.\u201d The person added that the \u201ccover e-mail\u201d to the company \u201cwill contain the TARP\u2026limitations plus additional restrictions we will get them in the very near term.\u201d The person also wrote, \u201cComp people -- please keep that moving and send around a new draft of that section with an explanation for the recommendations.\u201d ...Under terms of the revised bailout in November, the government applied \u201cstringent\u201d limitations on compensation on AIGs top five senior officers, as required under TARP legislation, according to a Treasury document. But Treasury took an additional step in compensation provisions, requiring limits on \u201cgolden parachute\u201d severance packages and a freeze on the size of the annual bonus pool for the next top 70 company executives as well. However, in the details of the term sheet on the assistance, officials specified that the annual bonus pools to the next 70 senior managers \u2013 called \u201csenior partners\u201d \u2013 for 2008 and 2009 \u201cshall not exceed the average of the annual bonus pool paid to Senior Partners for 2006 and 2007. According to company financial documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as of November 12 last year, the balance in the senior partners plan was about $6 million. The term sheet also indicates senior partners were eligible for AIG\u2019s \u201chistorical quarterly bonus program\u201d as well. In their efforts to limit compensation at AIG, Treasury officials appeared concerned over accounting for it to a critical Congress. In one exchange of e-mails between David Nason, an assistant Treasury secretary, and Jennifer Zuccarelli, a public affairs officer, discussed televised testimony before Congress in December by Neel Kashkari, the Treasury official managing TARP: Nason: How\u2019s it going? Zuccarelli: Bad. Serious questions, too, not \u201cchump\u201d type questions. They\u2019re going to start to break Neel down soon, I\u2019m getting worried he\u2019s going to start snapping. Nason: This AIG stuff is tough to watch. Zuccarelli: They killed him on exec comp.

Despite their deliberations at the time, the Treasury and Fed officials, which were part of the Bush Administration, eventually decided to restrict compensation on just the top 75 company executives--and some of them may still have received hefty bonuses... Many of the Treasury e-mails sent in November discuss compensation at AIG, particularly for top executives, including compensation for CEO Edward Liddy, a former insurance-company executive who agreed to take the top job at the company in September. \u201cDo you/Treasury want to be involved in helping design/discuss Ed Liddy\u2019s comp package?\u201d one e-mail said on Nov 25. In November, AIG announced that Liddy would receive an annual base salary of $1 for 2008 and 2009. The rest of his compensation, the company said, would consist of \u201cequity grants.\u201d He also would not receive bonuses for 2008 and 2009, \u201calthough he may be eligible for a special bonus for extraordinary performance payable in 2010,\u201d AIG said. It also said he would not be eligible for severance payments. In its negotiations with government officials in November, AIG submitted a \u201ccompensation proposal\u201d to them, the e-mails indicate. The emails also indicate compensation provisions were changed several times. One e-mail, from a law firm that worked on the transaction, stated, \u201cPlease find attached our comments to the compensation-specific provisions\u2026In a few instances, we have added comments to explain the thinking behind certain changes.\u201d In another e-mail, a person working on the transaction wrote, \u201cWe should get the term sheet to the company this morning. Because the comp section is still in real flux, we will take the content out of the draft to AIG.\u201d The person added that the \u201ccover e-mail\u201d to the company \u201cwill contain the TARP\u2026limitations plus additional restrictions we will get them in the very near term.\u201d The person also wrote, \u201cComp people -- please keep that moving and send around a new draft of that section with an explanation for the recommendations.\u201d ...Under terms of the revised bailout in November, the government applied \u201cstringent\u201d limitations on compensation on AIGs top five senior officers, as required under TARP legislation, according to a Treasury document. But Treasury took an additional step in compensation provisions, requiring limits on \u201cgolden parachute\u201d severance packages and a freeze on the size of the annual bonus pool for the next top 70 company executives as well. However, in the details of the term sheet on the assistance, officials specified that the annual bonus pools to the next 70 senior managers \u2013 called \u201csenior partners\u201d \u2013 for 2008 and 2009 \u201cshall not exceed the average of the annual bonus pool paid to Senior Partners for 2006 and 2007. According to company financial documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as of November 12 last year, the balance in the senior partners plan was about $6 million. The term sheet also indicates senior partners were eligible for AIG\u2019s \u201chistorical quarterly bonus program\u201d as well. In their efforts to limit compensation at AIG, Treasury officials appeared concerned over accounting for it to a critical Congress. In one exchange of e-mails between David Nason, an assistant Treasury secretary, and Jennifer Zuccarelli, a public affairs officer, discussed televised testimony before Congress in December by Neel Kashkari, the Treasury official managing TARP: Nason: How\u2019s it going? Zuccarelli: Bad. Serious questions, too, not \u201cchump\u201d type questions. They\u2019re going to start to break Neel down soon, I\u2019m getting worried he\u2019s going to start snapping. Nason: This AIG stuff is tough to watch. Zuccarelli: They killed him on exec comp. He didn\u2019t know answer. \"http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/finance/treasury-fed-reviewed-aig-bonus-info-months-ago/\"",

The emails also indicate compensation provisions were changed several times. One e-mail, from a law firm that worked on the transaction, stated, \u201cPlease find attached our comments to the compensation-specific provisions\u2026In a few instances, we have added comments to explain the thinking behind certain changes.\u201d In another e-mail, a person working on the transaction wrote, \u201cWe should get the term sheet to the company this morning. Because the comp section is still in real flux, we will take the content out of the draft to AIG.\u201d The person added that the \u201ccover e-mail\u201d to the company \u201cwill contain the TARP\u2026limitations plus additional restrictions we will get them in the very near term.\u201d The person also wrote, \u201cComp people -- please keep that moving and send around a new draft of that section with an explanation for the recommendations.\u201d ...Under terms of the revised bailout in November, the government applied \u201cstringent\u201d limitations on compensation on AIGs top five senior officers, as required under TARP legislation, according to a Treasury document. But Treasury took an additional step in compensation provisions, requiring limits on \u201cgolden parachute\u201d severance packages and a freeze on the size of the annual bonus pool for the next top 70 company executives as well. However, in the details of the term sheet on the assistance, officials specified that the annual bonus pools to the next 70 senior managers \u2013 called \u201csenior partners\u201d \u2013 for 2008 and 2009 \u201cshall not exceed the average of the annual bonus pool paid to Senior Partners for 2006 and 2007. According to company financial documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as of November 12 last year, the balance in the senior partners plan was about $6 million. The term sheet also indicates senior partners were eligible for AIG\u2019s \u201chistorical quarterly bonus program\u201d as well. In their efforts to limit compensation at AIG, Treasury officials appeared concerned over accounting for it to a critical Congress. In one exchange of e-mails between David Nason, an assistant Treasury secretary, and Jennifer Zuccarelli, a public affairs officer, discussed televised testimony before Congress in December by Neel Kashkari, the Treasury official managing TARP: Nason: How\u2019s it going? Zuccarelli: Bad. Serious questions, too, not \u201cchump\u201d type questions. They\u2019re going to start to break Neel down soon, I\u2019m getting worried he\u2019s going to start snapping. Nason: This AIG stuff is tough to watch. Zuccarelli: They killed him on exec comp. He didn\u2019t know answer. \"http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/finance/treasury-fed-reviewed-aig-bonus-info-months-ago/\"",

I don't get how a person could lie to the people they are supposed to represent and keep their job, I can't wait for the next two elections to be over with, I want these b-st-rds gone. We've let these Corporate giants grow until their failure would drag the rest of us down with them. Well, this is water under the bridge - What to do? Simply shovel money in their general direction? This has been the policy of Mr. Bush, and it's NOW the policy of Mr. Obama. This is why I say the question is poorly framed. It's NOT a either we let them fail OR shovel money at them. The simple common sense Capitalist solution is for the Feds to buy them up at their true value (nothing) and then use this bail out money to Capitalise them, lend honest companies and individuals money. Once these financial companies are on a firm footing (which would take six months to a year) sell them on the open market to private interests. The companies are saved, money flows out, We the People make a profit. One of the interesting footnotes to this question is that economists from the Wall Street Journal on down, tell us that DESPITE all the money we are giving these clowns, they are not increasing their lending. Why pray tell are we giving them this money then? Isn't that the supposed reason? I'm not going to blame Mr. Obama MORE than Mr. Bush, or the other way around - It's the way we have allowed the question to be framed that is the problem. Dave",

The question is being framed as \"Either/Or - Either we let these companies fail, Or we shovel cash at them. Dave, it is my understanding that AIG handles the pensions for our Federal employees, our elected being part of that. Congress will not let a company fail that holds congresses financial interest in hand. I think each and every one of these companies that have been bailed out should have been left to the wolves. The next election should reveal a smarter voting public I hope and we should see a lot of these politicians sent packing. The majority of the voting public is so easily misled that I fear these crooks just might actually be able to keep their seats and that would be a shame. Rewarding failure is exactly what they are doing just as you say. I would not hire/vote for any of them.
