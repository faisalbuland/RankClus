The United States constitutes an \"axis of disobedience\" along with North Korea and Saddam-era Iraq. Those are the views of the man on track to become one of the US government's top lawyers: Harold Koh. President Obama has nominated Koh -- until last week the dean of Yale Law School -- to be the State Department's legal adviser. In that job, Koh would forge a wide range of international agreements on issues from trade to arms control, and help represent our country in such places as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. It's a job where you want a strong defender of America's sovereignty. But that's not Koh. He's a fan of \"transnational legal process,\" arguing that the distinctions between US and international law should vanish. What would this look like in a practical sense? Well, California voters have overruled their courts, which had imposed same-sex marriage on the state. Koh would like to see such matters go up the chain through federal courts -- which, in turn, should look to the rest of the world. If Canada, the European Human Rights Commission and the United Nations all say gay marriage should be legal -- well, then, it should be legal in California too, regardless of what the state's voters and elected representatives might say. He even believes judges should use this \"logic\" to strike down the death penalty, which is clearly permitted in the US Constitution. The primacy of international legal \"norms\" applies even to treaties we reject. For example, Koh believes that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child -- a problematic document that we haven't ratified -- should dictate the age at which individual US states can execute criminals. Got that? On issues ranging from affirmative action to the interrogation of terrorists, what the rest of the world says, goes. Including, apparently, the world of radical imams.

After all they don't have a history of screwing up their society like the USA does. Bill, it's about diversity dude, get with the program. I doubt that America's homosexual population will warmly embrace the \"diversity\" that might come with islamic law, or....women, for that matter! Right, but it doesnt matter muslim accommodations are more important. Yeah, right. American women make up roughly 52% of the population and NONE want to regress. Perhaps Michelle Obama will opine on this issue.",

The United States constitutes an \"axis of disobedience\" along with North Korea and Saddam-era Iraq. Those are the views of the man on track to become one of the US government's top lawyers: Harold Koh. President Obama has nominated Koh -- until last week the dean of Yale Law School -- to be the State Department's legal adviser. In that job, Koh would forge a wide range of international agreements on issues from trade to arms control, and help represent our country in such places as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. It's a job where you want a strong defender of America's sovereignty. But that's not Koh. He's a fan of \"transnational legal process,\" arguing that the distinctions between US and international law should vanish. What would this look like in a practical sense? Well, California voters have overruled their courts, which had imposed same-sex marriage on the state. Koh would like to see such matters go up the chain through federal courts -- which, in turn, should look to the rest of the world. If Canada, the European Human Rights Commission and the United Nations all say gay marriage should be legal -- well, then, it should be legal in California too, regardless of what the state's voters and elected representatives might say. He even believes judges should use this \"logic\" to strike down the death penalty, which is clearly permitted in the US Constitution. The primacy of international legal \"norms\" applies even to treaties we reject. For example, Koh believes that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child -- a problematic document that we haven't ratified -- should dictate the age at which individual US states can execute criminals. Got that? On issues ranging from affirmative action to the interrogation of terrorists, what the rest of the world says, goes. Including, apparently, the world of radical imams.

I'm suprised at you Sgt. Both for claiming ignorance and for your denial of the existence of these laws based on the Qur'an Sunna, ijma' and qiyas. A simple search with the keyword shari\u00b7\u2018a or sharia also shariah, would give you an answer. quote: Excerp from Wikipedia: Sharia Sharia (Arabic: '\u200e\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 transliteration: \u0160ar\u012b\u02bfah) is the body of Islamic religious law. The term means \"way\" or \"path to the water source\"; it is the legal framework within which the public and private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles of jurisprudence and for Muslims living outside the domain. Sharia deals with many aspects of day-to-day life, including politics, economics, banking, business, contracts, family, sexuality, hygiene, and social issues. Before the 19th century, legal theory was considered the domain of the traditional legal schools of thought. Most Sunni Muslims follow Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki or Shafii, while most Shia Muslims, the Twelvers, follow the Jaafari school of thought.[1] Islamic law is now the most widely used religious law, and one of the three most common legal systems of the world alongside common law and civil law.[2] During the Islamic Golden Age, classical Islamic law may have influenced the development of common law,[3] and also influenced the development of several civil law institutions.[4] quote: Excerp from the Islamic Dictionary: shari'a \"Way to the water.\" The \"way\" of Islam in accord with the Qur'an and Sunna, ijma' and qiyas. Sharia is the law of Islam. It is based on the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunna, though there are many sources outside these two, such as Arab Bedouin law, commercial law from Mecca, and the law of some conquered nations such as Roman and Jewish law. The Sharia extends beyond what Westerners consider law. It covers the totality of religious, political, social, including private life and makes no distinction between sin and law. These excerps and more can be found at the sources and at \"http://www.answers.com/topic/sharia\" There are also a list of these laws at the above site.",

The term means \"way\" or \"path to the water source\"; it is the legal framework within which the public and private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles of jurisprudence and for Muslims living outside the domain. Sharia deals with many aspects of day-to-day life, including politics, economics, banking, business, contracts, family, sexuality, hygiene, and social issues. Before the 19th century, legal theory was considered the domain of the traditional legal schools of thought. Most Sunni Muslims follow Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki or Shafii, while most Shia Muslims, the Twelvers, follow the Jaafari school of thought.[1] Islamic law is now the most widely used religious law, and one of the three most common legal systems of the world alongside common law and civil law.[2] During the Islamic Golden Age, classical Islamic law may have influenced the development of common law,[3] and also influenced the development of several civil law institutions.[4] quote: Excerp from the Islamic Dictionary: shari'a \"Way to the water.\" The \"way\" of Islam in accord with the Qur'an and Sunna, ijma' and qiyas. Sharia is the law of Islam. It is based on the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunna, though there are many sources outside these two, such as Arab Bedouin law, commercial law from Mecca, and the law of some conquered nations such as Roman and Jewish law. The Sharia extends beyond what Westerners consider law. It covers the totality of religious, political, social, including private life and makes no distinction between sin and law.

It's a subjective concept that exists solely in the minds of those who follow various portions of said concept. When a Muslim says they agree with Shariah law, what they are often stating is that they believe in principle that the laws they should obey should be in accordance to their individual or groups interpretation of their understanding of Islam in practice.
