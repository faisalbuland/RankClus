Care to describe a better \"climate\", anyone, Bueller,....anyone? Please post your source(s) Peter. Here is my source... care to impeach it? quote: Global sea level and the Earth's climate are closely linked. The Earth's climate has warmed about 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) during the last 100 years. As the climate has warmed following the end of a recent cold period known as the \"Little Ice Age\" in the 19th century, sea level has been rising about 1 to 2 millimeters per year due to the reduction in volume of ice caps, ice fields, and mountain glaciers in addition to the thermal expansion of ocean water. If present trends continue, including an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse-gas emissions, many of the world's mountain glaciers will disappear. For example, at the current rate of melting, all glaciers will be gone from Glacier National Park, Montana, by the middle of the next century (fig. 1). In Iceland, about 11 percent of the island is covered by glaciers (mostly ice caps). If warming continues, Iceland's glaciers will decrease by 40 percent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200. Most of the current global land ice mass is located in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (table 1). Complete melting of these ice sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 80 meters (that is about 222 feet of rise) , whereas melting of all other glaciers could lead to a sea-level rise of only one-half meter Reduction of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets similar to past reductions would cause sea level to rise 10 or more meters. A sea-level rise of 10 meters would flood about 25 percent of the U.S. population, with the major impact being mostly on the people and infrastructures in the Gulf and East Coast States (fig. 3)",

Anyone out there, when consulting the Vostok Ice Core DATA, able to pick a time on the graph where the climate is better than now? Anyone?

        "reply": " Please post your source(s) Peter. Here is my source... care to impeach it? quote: Global sea level and the Earth's climate are closely linked. The Earth's climate has warmed about 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) during the last 100 years. As the climate has warmed following the end of a recent cold period known as the \"Little Ice Age\" in the 19th century, sea level has been rising about 1 to 2 millimeters per year due to the reduction in volume of ice caps, ice fields, and mountain glaciers in addition to the thermal expansion of ocean water. If present trends continue, including an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse-gas emissions, many of the world's mountain glaciers will disappear. For example, at the current rate of melting, all glaciers will be gone from Glacier National Park, Montana, by the middle of the next century (fig. 1). In Iceland, about 11 percent of the island is covered by glaciers (mostly ice caps). If warming continues, Iceland's glaciers will decrease by 40 percent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200. Most of the current global land ice mass is located in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (table 1). Complete melting of these ice sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 80 meters (that is about 222 feet of rise) , whereas melting of all other glaciers could lead to a sea-level rise of only one-half meter Reduction of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets similar to past reductions would cause sea level to rise 10 or more meters. A sea-level rise of 10 meters would flood about 25 percent of the U.S. population, with the major impact being mostly on the people and infrastructures in the Gulf and East Coast States (fig. 3)",

When it melts, the water does not rise. As for glaciers, how many of them are near enough to an ocean to actually find their way into the ocean. Most will fill the nearest void near to them. And, if it is indeed getting warmer, then water would evaporate at an accelerated level. So, I would imagine that you cannot use static evaporation data and say what level the ocean would rise to. The simple fact is that we have already been in the warming period for some time (which was expected, it just came a little early), but we are going to be going back into a cooling cycle (which is also expected). The reality is that there is a ton of money to be made off of GW, so people will continue to talk about it, even if there were irrefutable evidence to the contrary. While there is no irrefutable evidence that GW doesn't exist, there is also no irrefutable evidence that it does exist. The only scientists that have been saying that it does are primarily those that work for the governments of the US and a few European countries. The one thing that is a fact is that the cycles of the sun have more of an impact on the warming and cooling of the earth than any activity actually originating on the earth. So, you better find a way to reduce solar flares, because it will get hot again... But, then again, it will also get cold again. Climate change, it's been around long before people decided to make it a buzz word in order to profit from it. It is almost as ingenious as the guy that duped everybody into buying bottled water.

When it melts, the water does not rise. As for glaciers, how many of them are near enough to an ocean to actually find their way into the ocean. Most will fill the nearest void near to them. And, if it is indeed getting warmer, then water would evaporate at an accelerated level. So, I would imagine that you cannot use static evaporation data and say what level the ocean would rise to. The simple fact is that we have already been in the warming period for some time (which was expected, it just came a little early), but we are going to be going back into a cooling cycle (which is also expected). The reality is that there is a ton of money to be made off of GW, so people will continue to talk about it, even if there were irrefutable evidence to the contrary. While there is no irrefutable evidence that GW doesn't exist, there is also no irrefutable evidence that it does exist. The only scientists that have been saying that it does are primarily those that work for the governments of the US and a few European countries. The one thing that is a fact is that the cycles of the sun have more of an impact on the warming and cooling of the earth than any activity actually originating on the earth. So, you better find a way to reduce solar flares, because it will get hot again... But, then again, it will also get cold again. Climate change, it's been around long before people decided to make it a buzz word in order to profit from it. It is almost as ingenious as the guy that duped everybody into buying bottled water. Almost...",

Here is my source... care to impeach it? quote: Global sea level and the Earth's climate are closely linked. The Earth's climate has warmed about 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) during the last 100 years. As the climate has warmed following the end of a recent cold period known as the \"Little Ice Age\" in the 19th century, sea level has been rising about 1 to 2 millimeters per year due to the reduction in volume of ice caps, ice fields, and mountain glaciers in addition to the thermal expansion of ocean water. If present trends continue, including an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse-gas emissions, many of the world's mountain glaciers will disappear. For example, at the current rate of melting, all glaciers will be gone from Glacier National Park, Montana, by the middle of the next century (fig. 1). In Iceland, about 11 percent of the island is covered by glaciers (mostly ice caps). If warming continues, Iceland's glaciers will decrease by 40 percent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200. Most of the current global land ice mass is located in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (table 1). Complete melting of these ice sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 80 meters (that is about 222 feet of rise) , whereas melting of all other glaciers could lead to a sea-level rise of only one-half meter Reduction of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets similar to past reductions would cause sea level to rise 10 or more meters. A sea-level rise of 10 meters would flood about 25 percent of the U.S. population, with the major impact being mostly on the people and infrastructures in the Gulf and East Coast States (fig. 3)",

Here is my source... care to impeach it? quote: Global sea level and the Earth's climate are closely linked. The Earth's climate has warmed about 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) during the last 100 years. As the climate has warmed following the end of a recent cold period known as the \"Little Ice Age\" in the 19th century, sea level has been rising about 1 to 2 millimeters per year due to the reduction in volume of ice caps, ice fields, and mountain glaciers in addition to the thermal expansion of ocean water. If present trends continue, including an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse-gas emissions, many of the world's mountain glaciers will disappear. For example, at the current rate of melting, all glaciers will be gone from Glacier National Park, Montana, by the middle of the next century (fig. 1). In Iceland, about 11 percent of the island is covered by glaciers (mostly ice caps). If warming continues, Iceland's glaciers will decrease by 40 percent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200. Most of the current global land ice mass is located in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (table 1). Complete melting of these ice sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 80 meters (that is about 222 feet of rise) , whereas melting of all other glaciers could lead to a sea-level rise of only one-half meter Reduction of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets similar to past reductions would cause sea level to rise 10 or more meters. A sea-level rise of 10 meters would flood about 25 percent of the U.S. population, with the major impact being mostly on the people and infrastructures in the Gulf and East Coast States (fig. 3)",

Care to describe a better \"climate\", anyone, Bueller,....anyone? Please post your source(s) Peter. Here is my source... care to impeach it? quote: Global sea level and the Earth's climate are closely linked. The Earth's climate has warmed about 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) during the last 100 years. As the climate has warmed following the end of a recent cold period known as the \"Little Ice Age\" in the 19th century, sea level has been rising about 1 to 2 millimeters per year due to the reduction in volume of ice caps, ice fields, and mountain glaciers in addition to the thermal expansion of ocean water. If present trends continue, including an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse-gas emissions, many of the world's mountain glaciers will disappear. For example, at the current rate of melting, all glaciers will be gone from Glacier National Park, Montana, by the middle of the next century (fig. 1). In Iceland, about 11 percent of the island is covered by glaciers (mostly ice caps). If warming continues, Iceland's glaciers will decrease by 40 percent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200. Most of the current global land ice mass is located in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (table 1). Complete melting of these ice sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 80 meters (that is about 222 feet of rise) , whereas melting of all other glaciers could lead to a sea-level rise of only one-half meter Reduction of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets similar to past reductions would cause sea level to rise 10 or more meters. A sea-level rise of 10 meters would flood about 25 percent of the U.S. population, with the major impact being mostly on the people and infrastructures in the Gulf and East Coast States (fig. 3)",
