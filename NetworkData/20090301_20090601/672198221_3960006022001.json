        "content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, announced last week that she wants to register guns. Her next move will be to try to confiscate them. The speaker picked a television show with a viewership of 4.6 million to float the Democrats' coming gun-control push. Questioned on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" about the prospect of new gun-control laws now that \"it's a Democratic president, a Democratic House,\" she responded, \"We don't want to take their guns away. We want them registered.\" Politicians and bureaucrats routinely claim that registration helps solve crimes. If a registered gun is used in a crime and left at the crime scene, registration supposedly lets the police trace the gun back to the criminal. Though this turn of events might work on fictional TV crime shows, it virtually never occurs in real life. Criminals' guns are rarely left at crime scenes. When guns are left behind, it usually is because a crook has been seriously injured or killed and the police are poised to catch him anyway. The few guns left at crime scenes rarely - if ever - are registered to the perpetrator. If they are registered at all, it is to someone else, whose piece was stolen. Despite what Mrs. Pelosi might think, those who use guns to commit major crimes such as robbing and killing are unlikely to respect her request to file paperwork so the government can catalog the tools of their trade. Numerous examples disprove gun-control propaganda. Hawaii has had licensing and registration of guns for about 50 years. After all of the administrative expenses and inconvenience imposed on gun owners, police there cannot point to a single crime that has been solved as a result of those programs. Given Hawaii's remote island geography, this should be an ideal place to keep track of guns because movement in and out of the state is limited and legal importation is controlled. If registration is going to work anywhere, it should work there. Unfortunately, criminals seem to be able to get their hands on guns virtually anyplace in the world. more here: \"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/13/39we-want-them-registered39/\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

I don't give a rat's arse what they say they 'won't' do. Can't trust the government, especially when the dems are in complete control. It's stupid and ludicrist to think that just by registering guns, it will eliminate gun violence or illegal guns. Those guns confisacted today that are not within the law or illegal are already confiscated. A lawful gun owner knows that they report emmediately that their firearm has been stolen.

The speaker picked a television show with a viewership of 4.6 million to float the Democrats' coming gun-control push. Questioned on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" about the prospect of new gun-control laws now that \"it's a Democratic president, a Democratic House,\" she responded, \"We don't want to take their guns away. We want them registered.\" Politicians and bureaucrats routinely claim that registration helps solve crimes. If a registered gun is used in a crime and left at the crime scene, registration supposedly lets the police trace the gun back to the criminal. Though this turn of events might work on fictional TV crime shows, it virtually never occurs in real life. Criminals' guns are rarely left at crime scenes. When guns are left behind, it usually is because a crook has been seriously injured or killed and the police are poised to catch him anyway. The few guns left at crime scenes rarely - if ever - are registered to the perpetrator. If they are registered at all, it is to someone else, whose piece was stolen. Despite what Mrs. Pelosi might think, those who use guns to commit major crimes such as robbing and killing are unlikely to respect her request to file paperwork so the government can catalog the tools of their trade. Numerous examples disprove gun-control propaganda. Hawaii has had licensing and registration of guns for about 50 years. After all of the administrative expenses and inconvenience imposed on gun owners, police there cannot point to a single crime that has been solved as a result of those programs. Given Hawaii's remote island geography, this should be an ideal place to keep track of guns because movement in and out of the state is limited and legal importation is controlled. If registration is going to work anywhere, it should work there. Unfortunately, criminals seem to be able to get their hands on guns virtually anyplace in the world. more here: \"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/13/39we-want-them-registered39/\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

The speaker picked a television show with a viewership of 4.6 million to float the Democrats' coming gun-control push. Questioned on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" about the prospect of new gun-control laws now that \"it's a Democratic president, a Democratic House,\" she responded, \"We don't want to take their guns away. We want them registered.\" Politicians and bureaucrats routinely claim that registration helps solve crimes. If a registered gun is used in a crime and left at the crime scene, registration supposedly lets the police trace the gun back to the criminal. Though this turn of events might work on fictional TV crime shows, it virtually never occurs in real life. Criminals' guns are rarely left at crime scenes. When guns are left behind, it usually is because a crook has been seriously injured or killed and the police are poised to catch him anyway. The few guns left at crime scenes rarely - if ever - are registered to the perpetrator. If they are registered at all, it is to someone else, whose piece was stolen. Despite what Mrs. Pelosi might think, those who use guns to commit major crimes such as robbing and killing are unlikely to respect her request to file paperwork so the government can catalog the tools of their trade. Numerous examples disprove gun-control propaganda. Hawaii has had licensing and registration of guns for about 50 years. After all of the administrative expenses and inconvenience imposed on gun owners, police there cannot point to a single crime that has been solved as a result of those programs. Given Hawaii's remote island geography, this should be an ideal place to keep track of guns because movement in and out of the state is limited and legal importation is controlled. If registration is going to work anywhere, it should work there. Unfortunately, criminals seem to be able to get their hands on guns virtually anyplace in the world. more here: \"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/13/39we-want-them-registered39/\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

What harm is it to register guns? That would mean, anyone that doesn't register their guns must be criminals, and in most all cases, this would be true. So register them. It would help law enforcement keep track of them. Or does the NRA not want this because they don't want illegally sold guns to criminals to be tracked? Because the NRA wants to protect lllegal gun dealers? Seems to be the case here. Since everyone has the Right to have arms, I am perfectly happy if the government operates under that assumption. Registration is a form of control I see nothing in the Constitution about the \"right to own registered\" arms.\" Indeed, I see nothing in the Constitution that authorises any cotrol over arms - It would in fact contradict the very purpose of the Second Amendment. If Ms. Pelossi wishs to do away with the Second Amendment, she is certainly allowed to being the amendment process - She is NOT allowed to overide the Constitution with a mere vote of Congress. Dave Ms Pelosi doesn't want to take away anyone's gun or guns, or repeal the 2nd Amendment, just register them. Seems to me a responsible thing to do. What's so difficult about that? Ms. Pelossi's conception of the Second Amendment is the RIGHT to kill as many defenseless animals as you can blow away. Registering guns, does indeed make sense if that was what the Second Amendment is all about. It's NOT. It's there for two primary reasons - As a last defense against government gone amuck, and for the obvious reason of self defense. Such being the case, the government has no more right to register my guns as they do to take them away. Not that the two acts are the same. But they ARE both violations of the Amendment. And, as has been pointed out, ONLY those who are NOT criminals would register. So you are simply accumulating a data base of honest gun owners. Dave The 2nd Amendment never gave US citizens the right to use them against a government gone amuck. That in and of itself is absurd. Can you imagine every wacko in this country using that as a constitutional defense to justify their personal views? The 2nd is merely a person's right to legally bear arms, not to create a citizen vigilante army. The other point you make, if law abiding citizens register their guns, that would mean those that didn't would be criminals. Sounds right to me \"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.\" - T. Jefferson",
