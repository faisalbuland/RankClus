Barnett, World Politics Review Last week I gave a plenary address to the Joint Warfighting Conference 2009 -- the annual East Coast naval extravaganza co-sponsored by the U.S. Naval Institute (USNI) and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA). This mega-conference opened my eyes to just how much things have changed inside our naval forces thanks to the ongoing long war against violent extremism. To give you an idea of the ground covered, I have to take you back almost 17 years. That's when the Department of the Navy came out with its post-Cold War strategic white paper entitled, \". . . From the Sea.\" This seminal document argued that the Navy's undisputed command of the seas compelled it to come closer to shore and influence events there, lest it risk losing its relevance in an emerging era of smaller wars. It was an incredibly bold shift for the country's naval leadership, signaling the end of the submarine mafia's firm control of the fleet and the subsequent return of surface commanders and marine flag officers to the forefront of naval leadership. I helped gin up that white paper. My military mentor in the process was a Marine colonel just selected for his first star, Tom Wilkerson. Like most of those who participated in this \"best and brightest\" brainstorm, Wilkerson and I walked away hoping we had made a lasting difference. We were wrong.

What he fails to realize is that, in the context of the Navy, this seesaw of strategic thought has left us spending billions of dollars for weapons platforms, effective weapons platforms, that do not exist and never will. Is there a problem with network centric warfare as a concept? Is a modern communications net somehow a bad thing in the littoral? It seems to me that it would be even more necessary. He touts his \"from the sea\" concept, but what he fails to recognize is that it never went away; they just changed the name to \"sea basing\" or whatever buzzword was popular at the time. The Navy is fully aware that in a 21st century environment its primary purpose is to actively support the warfighter on the ground. In an environment with increasingly more dangerous and less expensive threats, however, the need to remain ahead of potential waterborne enemies in a dangerous littoral is still a core requirement, without which we simply cannot project the kind of force he advocates.",
