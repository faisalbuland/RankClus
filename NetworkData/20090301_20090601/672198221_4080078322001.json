That's wrong to begin with but don't make it a federal offense if the other guy defends himself. President Clinton never received harsh measures after leaving office, which he was wide open to get, from the new Bush administration. Many in the talk shows or news media perhaps, but for an official of or the President himself blaming the previous office holder shows weakness on his own part. I say that not in personal preference but in embarassment to the oval office high esteem. From what I gather, the new administration has found it a little harder to be in the limelight than they thought.

Anything that takes that long to explain must be very complicated or CYA. Cheney it seems is only standing his ground and someone said that Obama again criticised the previous administration. That's wrong to begin with but don't make it a federal offense if the other guy defends himself. President Clinton never received harsh measures after leaving office, which he was wide open to get, from the new Bush administration. Many in the talk shows or news media perhaps, but for an official of or the President himself blaming the previous office holder shows weakness on his own part. I say that not in personal preference but in embarassment to the oval office high esteem. From what I gather, the new administration has found it a little harder to be in the limelight than they thought. Needing an assist, you don't wildly throw accusations at nearly half of the voting people and 90% of their representatives. The enemy's location is in Guatanamo and not a private citizens voicing his opinion.",
