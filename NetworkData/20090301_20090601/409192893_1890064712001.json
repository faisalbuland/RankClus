I did the same thing with President Bush and he did not let me down like BO has already. No other president in my memory has ever stooped as low as to continually whine about a previous president. Then there is the fact that he is spending more money than any other president in the history of this country. Money we don't have. How can anyone honestly believe that this man can do anything for this country and this economy when it keeps falling into this endless abyss of debt. The constant denial just gets on my nerves and the infighting between the 2 prominant parties is solving nothing.",

The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows the Republican Party's favorability rating at an all-time low. President Obama's is at an all-time high.

Frankly this Republican/Democrat war is about as childish as I've ever seen adults get. Get a grip people No No No, every chance Obama gets he makes sue he says he inherited this problem and that GB2 created it. His last BS was calling a reporter after the fact and whining that he is not a socialist and that he inherited this from the last Adm. Obama will you at least act like a President and grow up! I dont believe other presidents have done that. What? Every day on this board I listen to people ***** about Clinton, Regan, and Carter and how they are to blame for the way things are going on now. Pretty sure EVERY president blames the last administration, ever watch a debate? I didn't vote for Obama, but this election really brought out a lot of problems for the Republican party. Being an Independent, I feel I can comment with a lesser degree of bias since I disagree with about 60% of what the two main parties claim to stand for. The fact is that the GOP is in bad shape, no amount of Obama bashing is going to change that. I say this as someone who voted for McCain. The GOP's voter base is rapidly shrinking. They lost out in 2006 and 2008. The party keeps trying to recapture some conservative dream that never was, while most of the country is moving steadily towards the center, center-left. Laugh and disparage Obama all you want, but the facts are there in black and white. If you truly want to see Republicans regain some control in the next decade, a certain amount of self-critique is necessary.",

I did the same thing with President Bush and he did not let me down like BO has already. No other president in my memory has ever stooped as low as to continually whine about a previous president. Then there is the fact that he is spending more money than any other president in the history of this country. Money we don't have.

The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows the Republican Party's favorability rating at an all-time low. President Obama's is at an all-time high.

Get a grip people No No No, every chance Obama gets he makes sue he says he inherited this problem and that GB2 created it. His last BS was calling a reporter after the fact and whining that he is not a socialist and that he inherited this from the last Adm. Obama will you at least act like a President and grow up! I dont believe other presidents have done that. I completely agree Gunny. I was just trying to say in the nicest way I could that he is wasting his time blaming Bush (and everyone else he mentioned in his post) for everything, as is the norm for people who think BO can do no wrong. I have heard BO whine several times about his so-called inheritance from Bush and I have no respect for him because of that. I have tried to have an open mind with him. I did the same thing with President Bush and he did not let me down like BO has already. No other president in my memory has ever stooped as low as to continually whine about a previous president. COMMENT: ... then you either have a most \"convenient\" political memory, or you're simply misinformed. Then there is the fact that he is spending more money than any other president in the history of this country. Money we don't have. How can anyone honestly believe that this man can do anything for this country and this economy when it keeps falling into this endless abyss of debt. The constant denial just gets on my nerves and the infighting between the 2 prominant parties is solving nothing. COMMENT: ... then you must have registered an equal concern for the record deficits of the previous administration ... or is this mostly just a convenient partisan view?",

Pretty sure EVERY president blames the last administration, ever watch a debate? I didn't vote for Obama, but this election really brought out a lot of problems for the Republican party. Being an Independent, I feel I can comment with a lesser degree of bias since I disagree with about 60% of what the two main parties claim to stand for. The fact is that the GOP is in bad shape, no amount of Obama bashing is going to change that. I say this as someone who voted for McCain. The GOP's voter base is rapidly shrinking. They lost out in 2006 and 2008. The party keeps trying to recapture some conservative dream that never was, while most of the country is moving steadily towards the center, center-left.

I was just trying to say in the nicest way I could that he is wasting his time blaming Bush (and everyone else he mentioned in his post) for everything, as is the norm for people who think BO can do no wrong. I have heard BO whine several times about his so-called inheritance from Bush and I have no respect for him because of that. I have tried to have an open mind with him. I did the same thing with President Bush and he did not let me down like BO has already. No other president in my memory has ever stooped as low as to continually whine about a previous president. COMMENT: ... then you either have a most \"convenient\" political memory, or you're simply misinformed. Then there is the fact that he is spending more money than any other president in the history of this country. Money we don't have. How can anyone honestly believe that this man can do anything for this country and this economy when it keeps falling into this endless abyss of debt. The constant denial just gets on my nerves and the infighting between the 2 prominant parties is solving nothing. COMMENT: ... then you must have registered an equal concern for the record deficits of the previous administration ... or is this mostly just a convenient partisan view?",

Pretty sure EVERY president blames the last administration, ever watch a debate? I didn't vote for Obama, but this election really brought out a lot of problems for the Republican party. Being an Independent, I feel I can comment with a lesser degree of bias since I disagree with about 60% of what the two main parties claim to stand for. The fact is that the GOP is in bad shape, no amount of Obama bashing is going to change that. I say this as someone who voted for McCain. The GOP's voter base is rapidly shrinking. They lost out in 2006 and 2008. The party keeps trying to recapture some conservative dream that never was, while most of the country is moving steadily towards the center, center-left.

Jack Cafferty, Commentary: GOP becoming a cartoon 3/10/09 None of that crap matters now. Live in the present, not the past. Blaming others for the past will get you nowhere which is where you are going by denying the facts of the present. Frankly this Republican/Democrat war is about as childish as I've ever seen adults get. Get a grip people No No No, every chance Obama gets he makes sue he says he inherited this problem and that GB2 created it. His last BS was calling a reporter after the fact and whining that he is not a socialist and that he inherited this from the last Adm. Obama will you at least act like a President and grow up! I dont believe other presidents have done that. I completely agree Gunny. I was just trying to say in the nicest way I could that he is wasting his time blaming Bush (and everyone else he mentioned in his post) for everything, as is the norm for people who think BO can do no wrong. I have heard BO whine several times about his so-called inheritance from Bush and I have no respect for him because of that. I have tried to have an open mind with him. I did the same thing with President Bush and he did not let me down like BO has already. No other president in my memory has ever stooped as low as to continually whine about a previous president. COMMENT: ... then you either have a most \"convenient\" political memory, or you're simply misinformed. Then there is the fact that he is spending more money than any other president in the history of this country. Money we don't have. How can anyone honestly believe that this man can do anything for this country and this economy when it keeps falling into this endless abyss of debt. The constant denial just gets on my nerves and the infighting between the 2 prominant parties is solving nothing. COMMENT: ... then you must have registered an equal concern for the record deficits of the previous administration ... or is this mostly just a convenient partisan view?",

His last BS was calling a reporter after the fact and whining that he is not a socialist and that he inherited this from the last Adm. Obama will you at least act like a President and grow up! I dont believe other presidents have done that. What? Every day on this board I listen to people ***** about Clinton, Regan, and Carter and how they are to blame for the way things are going on now. Pretty sure EVERY president blames the last administration, ever watch a debate? I didn't vote for Obama, but this election really brought out a lot of problems for the Republican party. Being an Independent, I feel I can comment with a lesser degree of bias since I disagree with about 60% of what the two main parties claim to stand for. The fact is that the GOP is in bad shape, no amount of Obama bashing is going to change that. I say this as someone who voted for McCain. The GOP's voter base is rapidly shrinking. They lost out in 2006 and 2008. The party keeps trying to recapture some conservative dream that never was, while most of the country is moving steadily towards the center, center-left.
