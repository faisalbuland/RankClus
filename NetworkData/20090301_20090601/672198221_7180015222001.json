Experts think Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, dubbed \"The American\" by al Qaeda, speaks in the Somali video. \"Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,\" the unidentified voice raps on the video, which runs at least 18 minutes. The video also shows a man reported to be Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, dubbed \"The American\" by al Qaeda. He apparently is now in Somalia training and counseling Somalis from North America and Europe. He speaks in American English. \"Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,\" says the man believed to be al-Amriki. \"http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/05/04/somali.jihad.video/index.html\"",
