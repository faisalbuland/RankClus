Perhaps you mistook his being the director of the religion and faith program at the Human Rights Campaign. Doesn't look like President Obama is trying to wean any Christian groups from the program, just making it a little more diverse don't you think. I'm sorry to hear your feeling a bit sick over this, it really isn't that terrible to have a Gay Christian on board this program. Yes, Mr Knox is a Gay Christian... Mr. Knox disagreeing with the Pope's statement that \"condoms worsen the spread of AIDS\" doesn't make him a Pope/Catholic hater. I'd think it makes him smart. <<http://www.hrc.org/12300.htm",

They've been sucking at the government's teat for so long that they don't want to share the milk. Never mind the fact that the public funding of \"faith-based\" initiatives amounts to little more than government endorsement of religion, which violates the First Amendment. This committee for faith-based initiatives only belongs to people who agree with everything the Pope says (which excludes a lot of Catholics I know, actually), and who agree with all the Christian principles of faith and living. And, of course, only people who hate gays are allowed to glean funding from the federal budget. Personally, I think all religious groups should fund themselves. I don't see why the government should fund programs that come attached to a religious message. If a group wants to be a charity and receive government funding, then detach the charity from the religious organization. Sure, you can have religious people running the charity, but I believe that under the First Amendment, the government has no business giving money to religious groups, no matter what they're doing.",

When you use a church to deliver much needed aid, there's already a built-in infrastructure(i.e. buildings to store food, people who know and are involved in their communities leading to more efficient distribution, etc.). In some critically underserved areas the only thing you'll find for miles around is a church steeple. That's what makes faith-based initiatives such a powerful tool. Of course the danger is that the church will become the local kingmaker, i.e. you get food, you don't. When the church starts making these decisions based on whether or not the needy person agrees with their ideology, a bad situation can become worse ( want a loaf of bread? first, tell us what you think about abortion?) So the challenge becomes how can we take advantage of the opportunities churches present to us without ceding too much ground to their ideological whims?

What a lot of people don't realize is that a lot of the faith-based money spent during the last administration was sent overseas, primarily to Africa and, to a lesser extent, Asia. Some of the groups who took this money insisted upon ideological campaigns, particularly in the area of AIDS/HIV prevention. These campaigns, which used American Christian mores and pushed them unthinkingly into an African cultural framework, tried to \"educate the poor savages\" into understanding that abstinance was the only way to prevent HIV. While technically correct, this approach utterly failed to address the fact that the average ages of the nations we were dealing with was in the teens, and that women in these countries often do not have the choice to say no. These abstinence-only campaigns in Africa and Asia, coupled with \"charities\" that forced prostitutes to stop working wihtout offering viable alternatives (in other words, they demonized the victims) actually increased the spread of HIV/AIDS in these regions. Money that could have gone to condoms, a proven effective method of not only prophylaxis, but contraception (in countries with high poverty and high birthrates) went instead to the printing of ideological propaganda, all in the name of charity. A lot of groups over the last several years didn't see the movement to government funding of faith based initiatives as a way to really help people, but instead saw it as a way to increase their power base in the culture wars, both here and overseas. They don't view it the same way, because in their mind there is nothing that is more likely to help people than belief in their God, which is a commendable opinion - it just shouldn't be government funded is all. What should be government funded is practical proven solutions such as the ABC campaign in Uganda, which just about halted the spread of the virus there. The US Government should not be funding missionaries. It's a kind of soft colonialism overseas, and within our shores it enables those who pay only grudging allegiance to our Constitution.",
