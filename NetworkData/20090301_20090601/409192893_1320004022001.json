I did get lucky yesterday and find deals on 500 rnds for $209, which is still up 30% over 6 months ago. Regarding what is going on here - First, it is true, the military sold once fired brass to the market for like .12 a round - now that brass is required to be scrapped and sold as scrap metal, at pennies on the pound - this accomplished two things - 1) shorts the supply of brass for .223 reloaders, and 2) costs the military millions... Look at the tax recently placed on tobacco products - a carton of smokes went up 7.00 in this area, which was 33% - all tax. It isn't hard to believe that ammo will get hit equally hard - there is no doubting that this administration is going to try to attack the gun market from other-than a head on position - instead of banning the guns, kill the supply of ammo, tax the dog-snot out of it, ban the magazines, and require fire-arms training and liability insurance on every-fire arm owned... People are nervous. Personally, am I 'arming'? No, not yet - but what I am doing is making sure I will have an adequate supply of ammo so my guns don't turn into scrap when we can no onger get ammo and supplies... But I will tell you what, stand in line at a gun show and listen to people...a lot of them aren't stocking up - they ARE arming. The Wal-Mart here can't keep most popular ammunition on the shelves - from .22 up to .45 through 7mm, you just have to be there within hours of them unloading a truck or you are out of luck. I travel a lot, and always check supplies where I go - this is not a local issue... If you are a re-loader, good luck - try to find some dies and primers for the most hard hit calibers - which I would say are: .223/5.56 and 7.62x.39 9mm / .40 S&W / .357 / .45 \"All that is necessary for the forces of evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing.\" --Edmund Burke",

All of this, \"Obama/The Dems want to take away your guns and or ammunition,\" is just a bunch of rightist unfounded propaganda pushed because the neocons believe that if they say it enough, then folks will believe it is fact. Obama don't have squat to do with what happens in Californica any more than he can make anti-gun laws here in Texas...if the good citizens of Californica want to restrict ammo, then that is what they will do...and if Californica shooters don't like it, they can change it...Californica is a referendum state and the voters there have a lot of power to change laws they don't like without the state legislature...unlike here in Texas. The Dems lost their butts in 1994 in a large part because of the AWB and Brady Bill, and they are not going to do that again any time soon...of course, the Republicans will and then blame it on the Dems...THAT is what is happening right now.",

Look at the requirementsw for safe storage of firearms and the liability laws that are being changed as we write thisand guess what,you have a gun stolen and misused YOU are responsible for it legally after all if it was properly asecured it wouldn't have been stolen would it??? Open your eyes man wake the frig up and step down off your cloud in the sky. your flippin' hero's are gonna ***** all of us!!!!", 
        "reply": " Open your eyes, man and take a look around! All of this, \"Obama/The Dems want to take away your guns and or ammunition,\" is just a bunch of rightist unfounded propaganda pushed because the neocons believe that if they say it enough, then folks will believe it is fact. Obama don't have squat to do with what happens in Californica any more than he can make anti-gun laws here in Texas...if the good citizens of Californica want to restrict ammo, then that is what they will do...and if Californica shooters don't like it, they can change it...Californica is a referendum state and the voters there have a lot of power to change laws they don't like without the state legislature...unlike here in Texas. The Dems lost their butts in 1994 in a large part because of the AWB and Brady Bill, and they are not going to do that again any time soon...of course, the Republicans will and then blame it on the Dems...THAT is what is happening right now.",

Ha, one of the only things I like about you, skinny, is your apparent appreciation for the venerable .45 ACP round. It's my favorite pistol caliber as well. $0.40/round sucks for pistol ammo. Prices have indeed gotten out of hand. Hell I disdain $0.40/round for rifle ammo, (7.62x39mm). This is the reason I haven't taken the Glock 30 to \"the range\", (lawless adobe hills where I usually go a shootin'), for awhile. It's been cheaper to take the AK out, which is insane. Of course, that'll change as soon as B.O. bans Russian ammo. Oh well, at least the ol 12 gauge is still reasonably cheap to plink with. I'm just glad I did so much training with my Glock 30 last year before The One was coronated... as it'd be a hell of a lot more expensive to do so at today's prices.

I did get lucky yesterday and find deals on 500 rnds for $209, which is still up 30% over 6 months ago. Regarding what is going on here - First, it is true, the military sold once fired brass to the market for like .12 a round - now that brass is required to be scrapped and sold as scrap metal, at pennies on the pound - this accomplished two things - 1) shorts the supply of brass for .223 reloaders, and 2) costs the military millions... Look at the tax recently placed on tobacco products - a carton of smokes went up 7.00 in this area, which was 33% - all tax. It isn't hard to believe that ammo will get hit equally hard - there is no doubting that this administration is going to try to attack the gun market from other-than a head on position - instead of banning the guns, kill the supply of ammo, tax the dog-snot out of it, ban the magazines, and require fire-arms training and liability insurance on every-fire arm owned... People are nervous. Personally, am I 'arming'? No, not yet - but what I am doing is making sure I will have an adequate supply of ammo so my guns don't turn into scrap when we can no onger get ammo and supplies... But I will tell you what, stand in line at a gun show and listen to people...a lot of them aren't stocking up - they ARE arming. The Wal-Mart here can't keep most popular ammunition on the shelves - from .22 up to .45 through 7mm, you just have to be there within hours of them unloading a truck or you are out of luck. I travel a lot, and always check supplies where I go - this is not a local issue... If you are a re-loader, good luck - try to find some dies and primers for the most hard hit calibers - which I would say are: .223/5.56 and 7.62x.39 9mm / .40 S&W / .357 / .45 \"All that is necessary for the forces of evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing.\" --Edmund Burke",

Ha, one of the only things I like about you, skinny, is your apparent appreciation for the venerable .45 ACP round. It's my favorite pistol caliber as well. $0.40/round sucks for pistol ammo. Prices have indeed gotten out of hand. Hell I disdain $0.40/round for rifle ammo, (7.62x39mm). This is the reason I haven't taken the Glock 30 to \"the range\", (lawless adobe hills where I usually go a shootin'), for awhile. It's been cheaper to take the AK out, which is insane. Of course, that'll change as soon as B.O. bans Russian ammo. Oh well, at least the ol 12 gauge is still reasonably cheap to plink with. I'm just glad I did so much training with my Glock 30 last year before The One was coronated... as it'd be a hell of a lot more expensive to do so at today's prices. I plan to sit on the 2k .45 ACP rounds I currently have.",
