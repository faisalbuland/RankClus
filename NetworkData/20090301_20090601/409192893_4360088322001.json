The 23-hour a day lockdown you refer to is very rare in prisons, because it breeds restlessness and foments rebellion. Even at max-security most inmates get time to exercise and get out of their cell. They also get access to books and some degree of entertainment facilities. Even the death-row guys get that, and not just to be nice - it helps to maintain order and sanity among the prisoners, and provides a simple method of discipline when those activities are curtailed. As an recent Pennsylvanian and current Marylander, I would have no objections to either state taking the prisoners.

MALCOLM NANCE: No, I don't think it works at all. The problem with using procedures, if we're going to talk about waterboarding as opposed to many other variations of torture, the problem with using these tools is that you are applying duress and coercion to a subject, and that subject is going to want to make that stop, physiologically and mentally.

In 1947, the U.S. charged a Japanese officer, Yukio Asano, with war crimes for waterboarding a U.S. civilian. Asano was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. \"All of these trials elicited compelling descriptions of water torture from its victims, and resulted in severe punishment for its perpetrators,\" writes Evan Wallach in the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law. On Jan. 21, 1968, The Washington Post ran a front-page photo of a U.S. soldier supervising the waterboarding of a captured North Vietnamese soldier. The caption said the technique induced \"a flooding sense of suffocation and drowning, meant to make him talk.\" The picture led to an Army investigation and, two months later, the court martial of the soldier. Cases of waterboarding have occurred on U.S. soil, as well. In 1983, Texas Sheriff James Parker was charged, along with three of his deputies, for handcuffing prisoners to chairs, placing towels over their faces, and pouring water on the cloth until they gave what the officers considered to be confessions.

        "content": "I wonder what an actual SERE training instructor has to say about waterboarding? Testimony before congress 2007: SR. CPO. MALCOLM NANCE (Ret.), Former Naval Instructor: Waterboarding is a terrifying, painful and humiliating tool that leaves no physical scars and which can be repeatedly used as an intimidation tool. Waterboarding has the ability to make the subject answer any question with a truth, a half-truth, or outright lie in order to stop the procedure. Contrary to popular opinion, it is not a simulation of drowning. It is drowning. - RAY SUAREZ: So your quarrel with calling it \"simulated drowning\" is that it is drowning, but it just isn't used to kill? MALCOLM NANCE: Well, it's controlled drowning. And if done wrong, by an unprofessional team or by an inexperienced team, you can kill that person quite easily. RAY SUAREZ: Does it work, Malcolm Nance? MALCOLM NANCE: No, I don't think it works at all. The problem with using procedures, if we're going to talk about waterboarding as opposed to many other variations of torture, the problem with using these tools is that you are applying duress and coercion to a subject, and that subject is going to want to make that stop, physiologically and mentally. And as they are trying to make it stop, they will come up with whatever you are asking. Maybe they'll agree with you or they will actually try to create some half-truth or a lie, in order to get you to stop the procedure. And waterboardings are relatively effective. We should clearly differentiate between the question of effectiveness and the question of extracting reliable intelligence information which is actionable. Those are two entirely different things.

        "reply": "I wonder what an actual SERE training instructor has to say about waterboarding? Testimony before congress 2007: SR. CPO. MALCOLM NANCE (Ret.), Former Naval Instructor: Waterboarding is a terrifying, painful and humiliating tool that leaves no physical scars and which can be repeatedly used as an intimidation tool. Waterboarding has the ability to make the subject answer any question with a truth, a half-truth, or outright lie in order to stop the procedure. Contrary to popular opinion, it is not a simulation of drowning. It is drowning. - RAY SUAREZ: So your quarrel with calling it \"simulated drowning\" is that it is drowning, but it just isn't used to kill? MALCOLM NANCE: Well, it's controlled drowning. And if done wrong, by an unprofessional team or by an inexperienced team, you can kill that person quite easily. RAY SUAREZ: Does it work, Malcolm Nance? MALCOLM NANCE: No, I don't think it works at all. The problem with using procedures, if we're going to talk about waterboarding as opposed to many other variations of torture, the problem with using these tools is that you are applying duress and coercion to a subject, and that subject is going to want to make that stop, physiologically and mentally. And as they are trying to make it stop, they will come up with whatever you are asking. Maybe they'll agree with you or they will actually try to create some half-truth or a lie, in order to get you to stop the procedure. And waterboardings are relatively effective.

In 1947, the U.S. charged a Japanese officer, Yukio Asano, with war crimes for waterboarding a U.S. civilian. Asano was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. \"All of these trials elicited compelling descriptions of water torture from its victims, and resulted in severe punishment for its perpetrators,\" writes Evan Wallach in the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law. On Jan. 21, 1968, The Washington Post ran a front-page photo of a U.S. soldier supervising the waterboarding of a captured North Vietnamese soldier. The caption said the technique induced \"a flooding sense of suffocation and drowning, meant to make him talk.\" The picture led to an Army investigation and, two months later, the court martial of the soldier. Cases of waterboarding have occurred on U.S. soil, as well. In 1983, Texas Sheriff James Parker was charged, along with three of his deputies, for handcuffing prisoners to chairs, placing towels over their faces, and pouring water on the cloth until they gave what the officers considered to be confessions.

As an recent Pennsylvanian and current Marylander, I would have no objections to either state taking the prisoners. And while Murtha does mostly represent rural communities, I think that yours was an unfair statement - there are some good people in his district, even if they do cling to guns and religion. Volunteer for the military, take a high risk of capture job, and go to SERE. You'll get waterboarded. Thousands and thousands of our troops have been waterboarded, and guess what, they live happy, successful lives. Even a few FOX NEWS reporters have been waterboarded, they volunteered to do it.", 
        "reply": " Still not even CLOSE to the same since the person under going SERE training KNOWS that 1) it is training, 2) the people doing the training would get in MAJOR truble if anyone is hurt, 3) they know how long it will last, 4) and they have control. They CAN stop it any time they want.",
