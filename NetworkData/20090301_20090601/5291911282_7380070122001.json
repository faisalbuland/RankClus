Why does the University of California, Irvine have a $5,000,000 grant to study why ceramic trauma plates are cracking, etc? The link is showing a non ceramic trauma plate being shot yet it is not selling anything. You retired safe and sound however others are still in there fighting. We both agree - In G-D we trust, all others we monitor!",
