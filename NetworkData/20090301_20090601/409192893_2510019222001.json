A friend of mine who is in Bible school right now made an interesting observation on Facebook this evening, one that fits well into the discussion here. In studying the apostolic sermons in the book of Acts, he noticed that the Apostles always preached Christ, but never once even mentioned Ceasar. Perhaps there is something to that. It is not only the party that lost its way in this unholy marriage between the Republican party machine and the Evangelical movement - the church has, as well. I submit that the governor has allowed his former profession to cloud his political judgment, and is making precisely the recommendation that will plunge his party into deepening obscurity. When will the Evangelicals realize that they have been cynically used by the previous president's political handlers for secular gain and get back to their real duty - preaching the positive message of their Christ?",

These folks (yes I'm one of them\") are a lot less radical and more thoughtful than you would believe, they are not arrogant enought to have written an autobiography at age 40 or so.

The 60's hippies and the MTV generation may have the bully pulpit, but they still have a lot to learn. I didn't make that quote. Gov. Huckabee did. Not that I agree with him on everything, that's for sure. On this one though, I think he's spot on the mark! And, that's all I was saying. IMHO, the Governor was calling it like it is. No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.

A friend of mine who is in Bible school right now made an interesting observation on Facebook this evening, one that fits well into the discussion here.

It is not only the party that lost its way in this unholy marriage between the Republican party machine and the Evangelical movement - the church has, as well. I submit that the governor has allowed his former profession to cloud his political judgment, and is making precisely the recommendation that will plunge his party into deepening obscurity. When will the Evangelicals realize that they have been cynically used by the previous president's political handlers for secular gain and get back to their real duty - preaching the positive message of their Christ?",
