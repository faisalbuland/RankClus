Was Bush a Muslim too? Saturday, December 15, 2007 WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States will pledge about $500 million for the moderate-led Palestinian government in the West Bank when Arab, European and other nations meet next week, U.S. officials said. The money would go toward a goal of $5.6 billion that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair hopes to raise to rescue the tattered Palestinian economy and reinforce institutions that would become the backbone of any eventual independent Palestinian state. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will deliver the pledge at a conference Blair has called Monday in Paris, the officials said. The officials spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because the figure has not been announced and might be changed slightly. The money is part of world efforts to improve the Palestinians' financial position as new U.S.-sponsored peace talks begin. \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,316932,00.html?sPage=fnc/world/mideast\"",

Obama has named a Middle East envoy, which Bush never did. But this administration's plan to maintain a tough stance on Hamas while seeking to bolster the Islamist movement's rivals and distancing itself from efforts to create a Palestinian unity government looks very much like Bush's policy of the past 8 years.
