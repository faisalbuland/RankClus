I will go to quotes by Washington before any other American, because he was closest to the core when this country was made, he understood more clearly than any single man what this country was founded on, and what it should mean and become - and lastly, he was the most selfless, fully American of all the Founding Fathers. You are an individual among 350 million. You may divorce yourself from religion while still trying to parallel its concepts, stripped of belief, and be a moral good person...but even in doing that, you are basing your actions on religious principles, because only religion can put any real meaning in a statement like, \"Human life is sacred.\" Without a \"God\" such a statement is a meaningless individual opinion, nothing more... A group of humans can get together and pass a rule that killing humans is wrong and should be punished, but it has no \"moral\" authority, since even the turn \"moral\" becomes just one more opinion - - Without a \"God\" there are really only two actual laws that govern life: \"Survival of the fittest\" and \"What's yours is mine, if I can figure out a way to get it or take it.\" God requires Man to be good Nature requires nothing but survival The person or society which chooses to be \"good\" often puts itself at a disadvantage, because many of the options for survival (kill the competition) have to be set aside. Those who disavow \"God\" take on all the advantages of acting in any manor they wish, without conscience...the criminal mind, the Nazi Hitler, the robber baron business man, the mafia don, the drug cartel leader... If you decide to superimpose on yourself a desire to \"be morally good,\" even though atheist, what do you use as a \"moral compass\" to know you are being morally good? Al Capone or the teaching of Jesus? Machiavelli or Plato? Karl Marx or Gandhi? Mao or Buddha? Pharaoh or Moses? Madoff or Martin Luther King? There are not too many out there who have shaped our concepts of \"good\" over the millennia by relative ethics or \"Natural Law\"... They have been profound religious teachers - - The French, during the \"Age of Reason\" tried to latch onto Science and Logic as a substitute or replacement for religious morality, also trying to abandon emotion for logic... But love is not logical. Compassion is not logical. Sympathy is not logical... Morality and Goodness are not logical. Survival of self at any cost is totally logical... Today, we are in the grip of \"relative ethics\" \"Natural Law\", and \"Social Darwinsm\" - all of which are very Machiavellian in their concepts of \"Whatever works is good and right\" \"Survival of the fittest in the business place\", and \"the end justifies the mean.\" A country without a moral compass and rudder must eventually spin out of control, because no one knows where it should go, and there is no way to guide or steer it - - Doesn't that describe America today? Where are we going? What should we be and do? Where should we be leading the world to? Why should we be leading at all? Why should anyone want to follow us? Why should anyone be upset about GITMO?? Explain to me what the true essence of \"good and moral\" is if there is no God - - Wandering and Wondering",

You may divorce yourself from religion while still trying to parallel its concepts, stripped of belief, and be a moral good person...but even in doing that, you are basing your actions on religious principles, because only religion can put any real meaning in a statement like, \"Human life is sacred.\" Without a \"God\" such a statement is a meaningless individual opinion, nothing more... A group of humans can get together and pass a rule that killing humans is wrong and should be punished, but it has no \"moral\" authority, since even the turn \"moral\" becomes just one more opinion - - Without a \"God\" there are really only two actual laws that govern life: \"Survival of the fittest\" and \"What's yours is mine, if I can figure out a way to get it or take it.\" God requires Man to be good Nature requires nothing but survival The person or society which chooses to be \"good\" often puts itself at a disadvantage, because many of the options for survival (kill the competition) have to be set aside. Those who disavow \"God\" take on all the advantages of acting in any manor they wish, without conscience...the criminal mind, the Nazi Hitler, the robber baron business man, the mafia don, the drug cartel leader... If you decide to superimpose on yourself a desire to \"be morally good,\" even though atheist, what do you use as a \"moral compass\" to know you are being morally good? Al Capone or the teaching of Jesus? Machiavelli or Plato? Karl Marx or Gandhi? Mao or Buddha? Pharaoh or Moses? Madoff or Martin Luther King? There are not too many out there who have shaped our concepts of \"good\" over the millennia by relative ethics or \"Natural Law\"... They have been profound religious teachers - - The French, during the \"Age of Reason\" tried to latch onto Science and Logic as a substitute or replacement for religious morality, also trying to abandon emotion for logic... But love is not logical. Compassion is not logical. Sympathy is not logical... Morality and Goodness are not logical. Survival of self at any cost is totally logical... Today, we are in the grip of \"relative ethics\" \"Natural Law\", and \"Social Darwinsm\" - all of which are very Machiavellian in their concepts of \"Whatever works is good and right\" \"Survival of the fittest in the business place\", and \"the end justifies the mean.\" A country without a moral compass and rudder must eventually spin out of control, because no one knows where it should go, and there is no way to guide or steer it - - Doesn't that describe America today? Where are we going? What should we be and do? Where should we be leading the world to? Why should we be leading at all? Why should anyone want to follow us? Why should anyone be upset about GITMO?? Explain to me what the true essence of \"good and moral\" is if there is no God - - Wandering and Wondering",

I will go to quotes by Washington before any other American, because he was closest to the core when this country was made, he understood more clearly than any single man what this country was founded on, and what it should mean and become - and lastly, he was the most selfless, fully American of all the Founding Fathers. You are an individual among 350 million. You may divorce yourself from religion while still trying to parallel its concepts, stripped of belief, and be a moral good person...but even in doing that, you are basing your actions on religious principles, because only religion can put any real meaning in a statement like, \"Human life is sacred.\" Without a \"God\" such a statement is a meaningless individual opinion, nothing more... A group of humans can get together and pass a rule that killing humans is wrong and should be punished, but it has no \"moral\" authority, since even the turn \"moral\" becomes just one more opinion - - Without a \"God\" there are really only two actual laws that govern life: \"Survival of the fittest\" and \"What's yours is mine, if I can figure out a way to get it or take it.\" God requires Man to be good Nature requires nothing but survival The person or society which chooses to be \"good\" often puts itself at a disadvantage, because many of the options for survival (kill the competition) have to be set aside.

If you decide to superimpose on yourself a desire to \"be morally good,\" even though atheist, what do you use as a \"moral compass\" to know you are being morally good?

There are not too many out there who have shaped our concepts of \"good\" over the millennia by relative ethics or \"Natural Law\"... They have been profound religious teachers - - The French, during the \"Age of Reason\" tried to latch onto Science and Logic as a substitute or replacement for religious morality, also trying to abandon emotion for logic... But love is not logical. Compassion is not logical. Sympathy is not logical... Morality and Goodness are not logical. Survival of self at any cost is totally logical... Today, we are in the grip of \"relative ethics\" \"Natural Law\", and \"Social Darwinsm\" - all of which are very Machiavellian in their concepts of \"Whatever works is good and right\" \"Survival of the fittest in the business place\", and \"the end justifies the mean.\" A country without a moral compass and rudder must eventually spin out of control, because no one knows where it should go, and there is no way to guide or steer it - - Doesn't that describe America today? Where are we going? What should we be and do? Where should we be leading the world to? Why should we be leading at all? Why should anyone want to follow us? Why should anyone be upset about GITMO??

I will go to quotes by Washington before any other American, because he was closest to the core when this country was made, he understood more clearly than any single man what this country was founded on, and what it should mean and become - and lastly, he was the most selfless, fully American of all the Founding Fathers. You are an individual among 350 million. You may divorce yourself from religion while still trying to parallel its concepts, stripped of belief, and be a moral good person...but even in doing that, you are basing your actions on religious principles, because only religion can put any real meaning in a statement like, \"Human life is sacred.\" Without a \"God\" such a statement is a meaningless individual opinion, nothing more... A group of humans can get together and pass a rule that killing humans is wrong and should be punished, but it has no \"moral\" authority, since even the turn \"moral\" becomes just one more opinion - - Without a \"God\" there are really only two actual laws that govern life: \"Survival of the fittest\" and \"What's yours is mine, if I can figure out a way to get it or take it.\" God requires Man to be good Nature requires nothing but survival The person or society which chooses to be \"good\" often puts itself at a disadvantage, because many of the options for survival (kill the competition) have to be set aside. Those who disavow \"God\" take on all the advantages of acting in any manor they wish, without conscience...the criminal mind, the Nazi Hitler, the robber baron business man, the mafia don, the drug cartel leader... If you decide to superimpose on yourself a desire to \"be morally good,\" even though atheist, what do you use as a \"moral compass\" to know you are being morally good?

There are not too many out there who have shaped our concepts of \"good\" over the millennia by relative ethics or \"Natural Law\"... They have been profound religious teachers - - The French, during the \"Age of Reason\" tried to latch onto Science and Logic as a substitute or replacement for religious morality, also trying to abandon emotion for logic... But love is not logical. Compassion is not logical. Sympathy is not logical... Morality and Goodness are not logical. Survival of self at any cost is totally logical... Today, we are in the grip of \"relative ethics\" \"Natural Law\", and \"Social Darwinsm\" - all of which are very Machiavellian in their concepts of \"Whatever works is good and right\" \"Survival of the fittest in the business place\", and \"the end justifies the mean.\" A country without a moral compass and rudder must eventually spin out of control, because no one knows where it should go, and there is no way to guide or steer it - - Doesn't that describe America today? Where are we going? What should we be and do? Where should we be leading the world to? Why should we be leading at all? Why should anyone want to follow us? Why should anyone be upset about GITMO??

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING Not my language but I support PRAYER in our country. other religions not christian can pray and do all their ceremonies and conveniences anywhere they want but when we the christians want to pray the left wing people and ACLU tries to stop us and say we are out of whack. It seems we do not have liberties or freedoms we came to this country for. We the people are sick and tired of watching our freedoms slowly being eroded away. Its the fact that the majority of this country are christian allows other religions to live here..to worship as they choose. realize that if this country was Muslim, any other religious person would be killed. the fact that we are christian allows others to worship as they choose.

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING Not my language but I support PRAYER in our country. other religions not christian can pray and do all their ceremonies and conveniences anywhere they want but when we the christians want to pray the left wing people and ACLU tries to stop us and say we are out of whack. It seems we do not have liberties or freedoms we came to this country for. We the people are sick and tired of watching our freedoms slowly being eroded away. Its the fact that the majority of this country are christian allows other religions to live here..to worship as they choose. realize that if this country was Muslim, any other religious person would be killed. the fact that we are christian allows others to worship as they choose. Pray we stay a CHRISTIAN NATION.....PRAY FOR OUR SOLDEIRS..WHATEVER CHRISTIAN RELIGION YOU ARE.... This message has been edited. Last edited by: mouse51, Thu 16 April 2009 09:05 PM",

I will go to quotes by Washington before any other American, because he was closest to the core when this country was made, he understood more clearly than any single man what this country was founded on, and what it should mean and become - and lastly, he was the most selfless, fully American of all the Founding Fathers.

A group of humans can get together and pass a rule that killing humans is wrong and should be punished, but it has no \"moral\" authority, since even the turn \"moral\" becomes just one more opinion - - Without a \"God\" there are really only two actual laws that govern life: \"Survival of the fittest\" and \"What's yours is mine, if I can figure out a way to get it or take it.\" God requires Man to be good Nature requires nothing but survival The person or society which chooses to be \"good\" often puts itself at a disadvantage, because many of the options for survival (kill the competition) have to be set aside.

You then follow it up (in an admittedly back-handed show of quasi-support for her stance), but indicate that the America of today is Lacking morals! So I guess a fair summation is that Christians have ruined this nation because of their lack of morals and their strong sense of greed and avarice, correct?

I will go to quotes by Washington before any other American, because he was closest to the core when this country was made, he understood more clearly than any single man what this country was founded on, and what it should mean and become - and lastly, he was the most selfless, fully American of all the Founding Fathers. You are an individual among 350 million. You may divorce yourself from religion while still trying to parallel its concepts, stripped of belief, and be a moral good person...but even in doing that, you are basing your actions on religious principles, because only religion can put any real meaning in a statement like, \"Human life is sacred.\" Without a \"God\" such a statement is a meaningless individual opinion, nothing more... A group of humans can get together and pass a rule that killing humans is wrong and should be punished, but it has no \"moral\" authority, since even the turn \"moral\" becomes just one more opinion - - Without a \"God\" there are really only two actual laws that govern life: \"Survival of the fittest\" and \"What's yours is mine, if I can figure out a way to get it or take it.\" God requires Man to be good Nature requires nothing but survival The person or society which chooses to be \"good\" often puts itself at a disadvantage, because many of the options for survival (kill the competition) have to be set aside. Those who disavow \"God\" take on all the advantages of acting in any manor they wish, without conscience...the criminal mind, the Nazi Hitler, the robber baron business man, the mafia don, the drug cartel leader... If you decide to superimpose on yourself a desire to \"be morally good,\" even though atheist, what do you use as a \"moral compass\" to know you are being morally good? Al Capone or the teaching of Jesus? Machiavelli or Plato? Karl Marx or Gandhi? Mao or Buddha? Pharaoh or Moses? Madoff or Martin Luther King? There are not too many out there who have shaped our concepts of \"good\" over the millennia by relative ethics or \"Natural Law\"... They have been profound religious teachers - - The French, during the \"Age of Reason\" tried to latch onto Science and Logic as a substitute or replacement for religious morality, also trying to abandon emotion for logic... But love is not logical. Compassion is not logical. Sympathy is not logical... Morality and Goodness are not logical. Survival of self at any cost is totally logical... Today, we are in the grip of \"relative ethics\" \"Natural Law\", and \"Social Darwinsm\" - all of which are very Machiavellian in their concepts of \"Whatever works is good and right\" \"Survival of the fittest in the business place\", and \"the end justifies the mean.\" A country without a moral compass and rudder must eventually spin out of control, because no one knows where it should go, and there is no way to guide or steer it - - Doesn't that describe America today? Where are we going? What should we be and do? Where should we be leading the world to? Why should we be leading at all? Why should anyone want to follow us? Why should anyone be upset about GITMO??

I will go to quotes by Washington before any other American, because he was closest to the core when this country was made, he understood more clearly than any single man what this country was founded on, and what it should mean and become - and lastly, he was the most selfless, fully American of all the Founding Fathers. You are an individual among 350 million. You may divorce yourself from religion while still trying to parallel its concepts, stripped of belief, and be a moral good person...but even in doing that, you are basing your actions on religious principles, because only religion can put any real meaning in a statement like, \"Human life is sacred.\" Without a \"God\" such a statement is a meaningless individual opinion, nothing more... A group of humans can get together and pass a rule that killing humans is wrong and should be punished, but it has no \"moral\" authority, since even the turn \"moral\" becomes just one more opinion - - Without a \"God\" there are really only two actual laws that govern life: \"Survival of the fittest\" and \"What's yours is mine, if I can figure out a way to get it or take it.\" God requires Man to be good Nature requires nothing but survival The person or society which chooses to be \"good\" often puts itself at a disadvantage, because many of the options for survival (kill the competition) have to be set aside. Those who disavow \"God\" take on all the advantages of acting in any manor they wish, without conscience...the criminal mind, the Nazi Hitler, the robber baron business man, the mafia don, the drug cartel leader... If you decide to superimpose on yourself a desire to \"be morally good,\" even though atheist, what do you use as a \"moral compass\" to know you are being morally good?

There are not too many out there who have shaped our concepts of \"good\" over the millennia by relative ethics or \"Natural Law\"... They have been profound religious teachers - - The French, during the \"Age of Reason\" tried to latch onto Science and Logic as a substitute or replacement for religious morality, also trying to abandon emotion for logic... But love is not logical. Compassion is not logical. Sympathy is not logical... Morality and Goodness are not logical. Survival of self at any cost is totally logical... Today, we are in the grip of \"relative ethics\" \"Natural Law\", and \"Social Darwinsm\" - all of which are very Machiavellian in their concepts of \"Whatever works is good and right\" \"Survival of the fittest in the business place\", and \"the end justifies the mean.\" A country without a moral compass and rudder must eventually spin out of control, because no one knows where it should go, and there is no way to guide or steer it - - Doesn't that describe America today? Where are we going? What should we be and do? Where should we be leading the world to? Why should we be leading at all? Why should anyone want to follow us? Why should anyone be upset about GITMO??
