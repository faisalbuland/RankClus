The whole original idea behing the NGB was NOT to spend stupid amounts of money on it. Its mission is easy to define, long range strike, nuclear or conventional take your pick. The question, from what I got from articles, is how it would be addressed in the next round of nuclear disarmament talks since the current agreements expire in December. Could other acft deliver similar weapon types? Yes, but not from the distance a bomber can and not from US territory. What has to be answered is are we ready to give up manned long-range missions at this time? Cruise missiles and tactical airframes are short-range in comparison with a much smaller load and that leaves us with a next generation UCAV to do it. But UCAVs culd not be deployed the way B-1s are currently being used in SWA, at least not yet with the same reliability and eyes on target.",
