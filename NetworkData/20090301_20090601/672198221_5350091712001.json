In a classic piece of Cartesian casuistry, de Gaulle distinguished between the North Atlantic Treaty, the one-for-all and all-for-one alliance of European and north American countries concluded 60 years ago next month, and the integrated military command of Nato, the organisation created by the treaty. France remained committed to the alliance, but was pulling out of the integrated command, as de Gaulle wrote: \u201cFrance would like to regain full exercise of sovereignty over her territory, currently breached by the permanent presence of allied military elements . . .\u201d More than 30,000 US personnel were kicked out of France, bases shut down, communications networks dismantled. As Time magazine put it then, de Gaulle\u2019s \u201cblow at the heart of the alliance\u201d enabled France to benefit from Nato\u2019s protection \u201cand kick it too\u201d. De Gaulle explained his motivation in his memoirs. \u201cA France without world responsibility would be unworthy of herself, especially in the eyes of Frenchmen. It is for this reason that she disapproves of Nato,\u201d he had told the US secretary of state soon after he became president in 1958. \u201cIt is for this reason too that she intends to provide herself with an atomic armament. Only in this way can our defence and foreign policy be independent, which is something that we prize above everything else.\u201d Now President Nicolas Sarkozy is about to reverse de Gaulle\u2019s decision. In the presence of Barack Obama, Sarkozy will announce at the Nato summit on April 3rd, on the Franco-German border between Strasbourg and Kehl, that France is returning to the integrated command. \u201cIn France, they made people believe that Nato was a threat to our independence, and nobody wondered why we were the only ones asking the question!\u201d Sarkozy said in Munich on February 7th. Appalled as de Gaulle might be at Sarkozy\u2019s decision, the general would doubtless understand his demand to be seated next to Nato secretary general Jaap de Hoop Scheffer at the ceremonies. Under a compromise reported by Der Spiegel magazine, Mr Sarkozy will sit to the right of the secretary general while television cameras are running, then move to his place in alphabetical order, as required by protocol, after the cameramen leave. Mr Sarkozy\u2019s Atlanticism and love for America were his original motivation, but his diplomatic adviser, Jean-David L\u00e9vitte, and the foreign ministry reportedly persuaded him to \u201csell\u201d the decision as a means of advancing the creation of a European defence capacity. Other Nato members have long distrusted French attempts to promote European defence. \u201cWhen we made proposals to our European partners, they said \u2018The French talk about European defence to weaken the Atlantic alliance\u2019,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Morin, the French defence minister. Yet Morin seemed to confirm those suspicions, adding, \u201cThrough our d\u00e9marche , we want to Europeanise Nato.\u201d As part of the effort to prepare public opinion for the change, Mr Sarkozy and chancellor Angela Merkel last month published a full-page opinion piece in leading French and German newspapers. \u201cWe are convinced that it is in our interest to make European integration and the Atlantic partnership the two faces of the same security policy,\u201d they wrote. But if European defence and Nato are two faces of the same coin, why are both needed? \u201cNato will be bogged down in Afghanistan for more than a decade,\u201d predicts a high-ranking official at the French defence ministry. \u201cIn the meantime, there may be a need for military missions in Africa, the Maghreb, the Balkans or Caucasus. We may need to rescue EU citizens.\u201d The same official describes Nato as \u201ca 60-year-old lady, with lots of love handles... (...)",
