This policy, fully written, covers almost all issues brought up in the forum and is able to provide both sides with their main goal. Surprisingly, after being introduced, the proposal only gathered 1 other proponent. Does unwillingness to compromise come from a notion that \"Our side must win and the other cannot\" for posters to be on board? Does this mean that many that claim to be objective are not? Does the fact that the original author is permanently suspended for thread disruption, as well as other threads being locked point to any larger pictures? All of these things point to one action: Attitudes need to change. For too long have many comments here been disrespectful, illogical, given special treatment, double standards, been hypocritical, unnecessary, uncontributing, unfurthering, inconsistent, off topic, flat out incorrect, unresearched and untactful. Yes, these are forums, so you can't expect great revelations, but when one shows up, are we too into ourselves to notice? All topics have been covered, if you still think something isn't covered by the policy put forth, you haven't read enough. Give it some serious thought, read where your issues have been covered, and then see if there's still a reason not to support that policy. Everyone wins, or everyone loses. If whatever comes next isn't exactly as it's stated in the proposal here, everyone will suffer. *edited to include link to proposal. This message has been edited.

Thus, it is obviously their agenda, and not that of those who consider DADT to be appropriate. I never said there was anything wrong with supporting status quo. What I have a problem with are people who unbendingly and blindly maintain a particular stance when all available evidence proves them wrong, and they will not, more likely can not provide any evidence supporting their position.

An other young sailor insisted he was gay to the point they let him out to stop his pestering every one to get out, and I doubt seriously he was gay! He had a girl friend, for one thing.

His \u2018compromise\u2019 was soundly reject, right from the beginning, by people who had been posting on here for some time - many of them appear to have given up and gone elsewhere I believe due to his insidious insistence on playing his plan over and over again. What part of \u2018no\u2019 didn\u2019t he understand? And he would not accept a rejection of his plan. He just kept shoving it back on the thread where ever and when ever he could. I think the Mods are intelligent enough to see what he was up to. Who couldn\u2019t see what he was doing? Sure he did a good job with any number of points but it was the part about quote: \"Sexual orientation,\" in inclusive Federal policy - first time.\u201d that was particularly troubling. That and his rather \u2018childish\u2019 attempts to stigmatize other posters who disagreed with him. He brought it upon himself. He wasn\u2019t looking for compromise. He was looking for indoctrination and approval of his \u201cbrilliant\u201d plan. But that is not what happen and he didn\u2019t like it. He played a game that others didn't want to play and he didn't like it when they played it the way he did. But he just kept shoving it out there even though it was obvious that few, so very few, wanted to consider that an acceptable \u2018compromise\u2019 for discussion. I, for one, as a heterosexual, thought it was beyond silly! He got rejected. \u201cAs you sow, so shall yet reap.\u201d There is no compromise. Do away with DA/DT. PERIOD. He didn\u2019t get it and it got him booted, I suppose, for disruption. (Just my guess.) But, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he reappears in some other nom d\u2019plume",

The \"agenda\" comes from those who wish to ignore the wisdom of such values to allow their johnny-come-lately selfishness to \"gain traction.\" Were they not pushing their agenda, these exchanges would not occur, would not be mentioned. Thus, it is obviously their agenda, and not that of those who consider DADT to be appropriate. I never said there was anything wrong with supporting status quo. What I have a problem with are people who unbendingly and blindly maintain a particular stance when all available evidence proves them wrong, and they will not, more likely can not provide any evidence supporting their position. So far no one has provided any evidence that openly gay service members are in any way \u201cprejudicial to good order and discipline\u201d. The Pentagon sponsored RAND study of 1993 shows no adverse affect. The real world experience of nearly 30 foreign nations shows no adverse affect. The 2007 Zogby poll of active duty military shows no adverse affect on good order & discipline. So far nothing has provided any evidence that gays & lesbians serving honestly will have the slightest impact on unit cohesion. If you have any proof, as opposed to \u201cgut feelings\u201d and apocryphal anecdotes, I would love to see it. As for your premise that soldiers are not obligated to serve with others whose actions s/he finds \u201cmorally offensive\u201d \u2013 hogwash! When have you ever heard of anyone being excused from serving with someone because they didn\u2019t agree with whom the other person was dating? One quote I love is, \"The military exists to protect democracy, not practice it. One does not pick and choose who one serves with.",

Views and values that developed over millenia are not unjust and inappropriate, just because they have existed for thousands of years. No soldier has any obligation to accept that he or she must serve with openly homosexual people, when the soldier finds it morally offensive; no more than the soldier is required to accept open adultery or other open behaviors highly prejudicial to good order and discipline. Keen mistrust and dislike of such behaviors is not only understandable but healthy. The \"agenda\" comes from those who wish to ignore the wisdom of such values to allow their johnny-come-lately selfishness to \"gain traction.\" Were they not pushing their agenda, these exchanges would not occur, would not be mentioned. Thus, it is obviously their agenda, and not that of those who consider DADT to be appropriate. I never said there was anything wrong with supporting status quo. What I have a problem with are people who unbendingly and blindly maintain a particular stance when all available evidence proves them wrong, and they will not, more likely can not provide any evidence supporting their position. So far no one has provided any evidence that openly gay service members are in any way \u201cprejudicial to good order and discipline\u201d. The Pentagon sponsored RAND study of 1993 shows no adverse affect. The real world experience of nearly 30 foreign nations shows no adverse affect. The 2007 Zogby poll of active duty military shows no adverse affect on good order & discipline. So far nothing has provided any evidence that gays & lesbians serving honestly will have the slightest impact on unit cohesion. If you have any proof, as opposed to \u201cgut feelings\u201d and apocryphal anecdotes, I would love to see it. As for your premise that soldiers are not obligated to serve with others whose actions s/he finds \u201cmorally offensive\u201d \u2013 hogwash! When have you ever heard of anyone being excused from serving with someone because they didn\u2019t agree with whom the other person was dating? One quote I love is, \"The military exists to protect democracy, not practice it. One does not pick and choose who one serves with.",

They post on here. Ask them how they did it. (BTW when I was in the service a long time ago, when homosexuality was a 'mental illness' and homophobia was the norm, there were two gay men on the small Cutter I served on, 'open' about being gay and everyone, including the officers knew it, and no one even suggested they get kicked out. An other young sailor insisted he was gay to the point they let him out to stop his pestering every one to get out, and I doubt seriously he was gay! He had a girl friend, for one thing.

My own insight to this, as someone who is \"in\" the military in a civilian capacity now, involved with attitude and behavior, I have found many active personnel (and retired) who do not think it's a big deal and don't care if gays serve or not. Well then, gays are welcome to serve....so long as they do so within the bounds of the UCMJ? All service members are expect to abide by the UCMJ, thus, heterosexuals should only be monogamous and use the 'missionary' position (no oral or anal sex) (and probably should remain celibate until married.) But you know as well as I do that that is not the case and few there are who fear getting 'kicked out' for \"plowing with someone else heifer\", as Sampson put it. It's a huge problem in the military. No, the 'sodomy' part is the UCMJ's failing and I would expect that it will get 'kick out'. I see you would \"allow\" gays to serve (as you have a number of times indicated) but why not let them serve honestly?",

All of these things point to one action: Attitudes need to change. For too long have many comments here been disrespectful, illogical, given special treatment, double standards, been hypocritical, unnecessary, uncontributing, unfurthering, inconsistent, off topic, flat out incorrect, unresearched and untactful. Yes, these are forums, so you can't expect great revelations, but when one shows up, are we too into ourselves to notice? All topics have been covered, if you still think something isn't covered by the policy put forth, you haven't read enough.

Yes, these are forums, so you can't expect great revelations, but when one shows up, are we too into ourselves to notice?

No soldier has any obligation to accept that he or she must serve with openly homosexual people, when the soldier finds it morally offensive; no more than the soldier is required to accept open adultery or other open behaviors highly prejudicial to good order and discipline. Keen mistrust and dislike of such behaviors is not only understandable but healthy.

All service members are expect to abide by the UCMJ, thus, heterosexuals should only be monogamous and use the 'missionary' position (no oral or anal sex) (and probably should remain celibate until married.) But you know as well as I do that that is not the case and few there are who fear getting 'kicked out' for \"plowing with someone else heifer\", as Sampson put it. It's a huge problem in the military. No, the 'sodomy' part is the UCMJ's failing and I would expect that it will get 'kick out'.

They post on here. Ask them how they did it. (BTW when I was in the service a long time ago, when homosexuality was a 'mental illness' and homophobia was the norm, there were two gay men on the small Cutter I served on, 'open' about being gay and everyone, including the officers knew it, and no one even suggested they get kicked out. An other young sailor insisted he was gay to the point they let him out to stop his pestering every one to get out, and I doubt seriously he was gay! He had a girl friend, for one thing. But that was long ago. My point being gays have served for a long time and often nothing would happen unless a scene was made about it. IMHO.) My own insight to this, as someone who is \"in\" the military in a civilian capacity now, involved with attitude and behavior, I have found many active personnel (and retired) who do not think it's a big deal and don't care if gays serve or not. Well then, gays are welcome to serve....so long as they do so within the bounds of the UCMJ?", 
        "reply": " All service members are expect to abide by the UCMJ, thus, heterosexuals should only be monogamous and use the 'missionary' position (no oral or anal sex) (and probably should remain celibate until married.) But you know as well as I do that that is not the case and few there are who fear getting 'kicked out' for \"plowing with someone else heifer\", as Sampson put it. It's a huge problem in the military. No, the 'sodomy' part is the UCMJ's failing and I would expect that it will get 'kick out'. I see you would \"allow\" gays to serve (as you have a number of times indicated) but why not let them serve honestly?",
