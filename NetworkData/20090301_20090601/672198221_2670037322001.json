The announcement will not reassure the U.S. government, coming just two days after President Barack Obama declared a readiness to seek deeper international sanctions against Iran if it shunned U.S. attempts to open negotiations on its nuclear program. Obama said he expected a positive response to his outreach for opening a dialogue with Iran by the end of the year. (...) The study published by the nonpartisan EastWest Institute also said Iran is making advances in rocket technology and could develop a ballistic missile capable of firing a 2,200-pound nuclear warhead up to 1,200 miles \"in perhaps six to eight years.\" Iran says its missile program is merely for defense and its space program is for scientific and surveillance purposes. It maintains that its nuclear program is for civilian energy uses only. The solid-fuel Sajjil-2 surface-to-surface missile is a new version of the Sajjil missile, which Iran said it had successfully tested late last year with a similar range. Iran's nuclear and missile programs have alarmed Israel, and the country's new prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pressed Obama to step up pressure on Tehran when the two met in Washington on Monday. Ahmadinejad has repeatedly called for Israel's elimination, and the Jewish state has not ruled out a military strike to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat...",

Getting rid of existing weapons is a nice goal, but EVERYONE (US, UK, France, China, DPRK, Russia, India, Pakistan) will have to agree to do it, not just Israel. I do not always agree with Israeli attitudes and actions, but they do have a right to exist, as do the Palestinians. The US did not create the situation as it exists and you seem to feel that we are brainwashed to believe that Israel only exists because of the US. And murdering innocents; of course Israel is the only one guilty of that in the region. I suppose there were no conflicts in the region where those caught in between did not get killed prior to 1947.

The announcement will not reassure the U.S. government, coming just two days after President Barack Obama declared a readiness to seek deeper international sanctions against Iran if it shunned U.S. attempts to open negotiations on its nuclear program. Obama said he expected a positive response to his outreach for opening a dialogue with Iran by the end of the year. (...) The study published by the nonpartisan EastWest Institute also said Iran is making advances in rocket technology and could develop a ballistic missile capable of firing a 2,200-pound nuclear warhead up to 1,200 miles \"in perhaps six to eight years.\" Iran says its missile program is merely for defense and its space program is for scientific and surveillance purposes. It maintains that its nuclear program is for civilian energy uses only.

The rest of the world is embarrassed at the gross stupidity of the uneducated, unsophisticated and unthinking Americans. It is also interesting to note that Israel has been attacked and not used nuclear weapons. It is interesting to note that at one time Israel was surrounded by nations intent on its destruction and they attacked for just that purpose. It is interesting to note that ME nations other than Israel have also taken land once claimed by the Palestinians. It is also interesting that Israel has not called for the elimination of Iran. It is sad to see that you do not grasp how dangerous nuclear proliferation is. Once that genie gets out, there will be no putting it back in the bottle until something bad has happened to force it. And what about other nations in the region? If Iran deploys nuclear weapons, why can't the rest of them? Getting rid of existing weapons is a nice goal, but EVERYONE (US, UK, France, China, DPRK, Russia, India, Pakistan) will have to agree to do it, not just Israel. I do not always agree with Israeli attitudes and actions, but they do have a right to exist, as do the Palestinians. The US did not create the situation as it exists and you seem to feel that we are brainwashed to believe that Israel only exists because of the US. And murdering innocents; of course Israel is the only one guilty of that in the region. I suppose there were no conflicts in the region where those caught in between did not get killed prior to 1947. So if Americans are everything you say we are, are you going to renounce your citizenship and move to the middle east?

Israel is the belligerent in the middle east, forever pursuing total hegemony against her neighbors. Israel is the one that has dispossessed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, murdering innocents, imprisoning and torturing Palestinians for daring to fight back to regain their property confiscated by Israel. Yet, the American people have been brainwashed into supporting the poor, persecuted Jews. How stupid Americans are, how ignorant and how gullible. As a sovereign nation Iran has every right to possess nuclear weapons. If the US wants to control the proliferation of nukes then it should demand that Israel relinquish its nuclear weapons. Americans are being fed a line by the Jewish controlled US government and the Jewish dominated media. The rest of the world is embarrassed at the gross stupidity of the uneducated, unsophisticated and unthinking Americans.", 
        "reply": " It is also interesting to note that Israel has been attacked and not used nuclear weapons. It is interesting to note that at one time Israel was surrounded by nations intent on its destruction and they attacked for just that purpose. It is interesting to note that ME nations other than Israel have also taken land once claimed by the Palestinians. It is also interesting that Israel has not called for the elimination of Iran. It is sad to see that you do not grasp how dangerous nuclear proliferation is. Once that genie gets out, there will be no putting it back in the bottle until something bad has happened to force it. And what about other nations in the region? If Iran deploys nuclear weapons, why can't the rest of them? Getting rid of existing weapons is a nice goal, but EVERYONE (US, UK, France, China, DPRK, Russia, India, Pakistan) will have to agree to do it, not just Israel. I do not always agree with Israeli attitudes and actions, but they do have a right to exist, as do the Palestinians. The US did not create the situation as it exists and you seem to feel that we are brainwashed to believe that Israel only exists because of the US. And murdering innocents; of course Israel is the only one guilty of that in the region. I suppose there were no conflicts in the region where those caught in between did not get killed prior to 1947. So if Americans are everything you say we are, are you going to renounce your citizenship and move to the middle east? (I am assuming you are retired US Army) It must be great to be so enlightened.",
