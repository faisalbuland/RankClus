I don't see any conspiracy Grachus. What I do see is a bunch of keen young soldiers plonked down in the middle of somebody elses's foreign (in every sense of the word) backyard and focussed on bending the inhabitants to their will, by friendship if possible, by force if necessary. All the while having little knowledge of their environment beyond what their interpreters tell them, what they 'learned' in training and distrusting anybody who isn't wearing camo and kevlar. Add to that the ability to rain incredible destruction at whim on 'disaffected loggers taking the Taliban buck'. I wish there was a story that 'backed you up' Dave. That would be the one about victory and it being 'over'.",
