The Federal government would be able override states and direct where the lines would go and who would pay for them.

You've got everyone from Duke Power to the TVA to various cities generating and moving power from one place to another. Virtually the same thing can be said of the natural gas system. Electric power is also bought and sold on the market with very little regulation. That's how Enron was able to screw over the customers in California. Overall, it's a system in dire need of not only an overhaul, but a central, guiding hand. As I understand it, the so-called \"smart grid\" which Obama's plan will likely be based upon, uses computers to control and direct power generation and distribution. Those computers will constantly monitor power demand and shift production and distribution from one place to another to meet the local demand. While that may include a necessity for the main trunk lines, or even the whole distribution system, to be owned by the government, it doesn't necessarily require the government to own the means of production. However, it may very well mean that your local generating station, whether privately or publically owned, will be at the beck and call of the smart grid. Since there is no way to store excess electricity, the smart grid will keep a watch over the entire country and bring production facilities on-line to meet demand or, take them off-line when demand is reduced. IF it is programmed to favor clean production, that means the coal and natural gas-fired plants will see their production time, and profit, decrease as clean sources are built, ultimately fading away for good. That's the real foundation of their opposition to Obama's projected plans, in spite of how often they say it will increase your electicity bill by X number of dollars. The only thing holding up more clean production is transmission lines, which don't go where the best wind or solar conditions prevail. New lines must be built to accomodate the wind turbines in Texas or Iowa or offshore and the solar generators in California and Nevada. That's what they are talking about here. Remember, the current grid is set up to accomodate coal or gas-fired plants which can be built just about anywhere. Building those new transmission lines will be a problem UNLESS the federal government, which will presumably own the lines, has the authority to over-rule local and/or state objections. Without that authority, it could take decades to build as each new line has to fight it's way through hundreds of NIMBY lawsuits. The bottom line is this: Do you WANT to have clean power available as soon as possible? If you do, support this idea. And, it's nothing new. The same fight was fought over the interstate highway system and I'm betting few now object to that.",

The Federal government would be able override states and direct where the lines would go and who would pay for them. In unveiling the proposal, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said an increased federal role in locating power lines was needed to encourage greater availability of electricity produced from wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable energy sources. While states and the federal government would jointly develop \"green\" transmission plans for such areas, the proposal gives final say to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take land under eminent domain and issue Senator Reid may be looking for a new career move after this term. He probably doesn't really care, after his questionable land deal in Nevada, he will probably set for life when the rail system goes through from L.A. to Vegas. Does that mean that wind turbines will finally be put off the coast of Massachusetts regardless of what teddy says? Aaahh! Probably not, Senator Kennedy and the Kennedy Clan have eminent domain in Mass.",

The grid needs to be upgraded but there always needs to be a back-up system in place. Why not upgrade the system we have while doing this grand scheme slowly? We're already going to charge power companies for producing clean fuel, that cost will be passed on. The total cost in the final analysis will be passed on to the consumer.
