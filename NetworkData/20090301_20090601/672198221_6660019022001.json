That means that we probably won't see any Rafales flying off those new Indian carriers being built or refurbished like the Admiral Gorshkov by the Russians for Indian use. quote: ++http://www.indianexpress.com/news/french-rafael-knocked-off-10-billion-race-for-iaf-fighter/447745/ In a shocker, the French Rafael fighter has been knocked off a $ 10 billion contract to provide 126 combat aircraft for the Indian Air Force. The French fighter, which was one of the six contenders for the race, was officially rejected by the Defence Ministry for failing to meet qualitative requirements for the contract. The news comes as a bit of a shock as the Indian Air Force has been maintaining that all six contenders \u2013 the American F 18 and F 16, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian MiG 35, Swedish Gripen NG and the French fighter \u2013 had met the technical requirements. However, a senior defence ministry official made is clear on Thursday that Rafael has been rejected at the technical evaluation stage for failing to meet minimum performance requirements that had been detailed in the tender document. The flight trials for the remaining five fighters are now expected to commence within three months, a senior MoD official said. (...) While the French fighter was always considered an underdog in the competition, which has been described as the largest international defence contract in the world, it was been aggressively pushed by the French government. Former President Jacques Chirac and his successor Nichols Sarkozy have been talking about the fighter in all their interactions with India. Interestingly, a separate contract, valued at close to $ 2 billion, for the upgrade of IAF\u2019s Mirage fighter fleet has also been stuck for several months with India and France stuck in commercial negotiations. While the IAF requires an urgent upgrade, the excessive price being quoted by France for the upgrade of over 50 fighters has been a dampener. The early elimination of the Rafael too is being attributed by insiders to high costs and failing to respond to technical queries. While the commercial bids were to be opened at a later stage, the cost of the fighter has always been considerably more than most of its competitors. Insiders also say that the ministry was not very happy with the replies it received on technical queries that had been sent after the French company submitted its technical bid. Sources say that the `half hearted\u2019 replies and failure to provide enough information were factors that were considered in the fighter\u2019s elimination from the second round of evaluations.

The original Mirage III wouldn't have been anywhere near as successful as it was sales-wise had Israel not bought them early on. As to the Mirage 2000's, the French were charging for them what we charged for F-15's, and the Rafale price was rumored to be even higher than that of the Typhoon.",

The Super Hornet has the benefit of a track record and higher numbers produced (which reduces the cost of each airframe).",

The F-18 will be easier to operate and maintain and its a hands down better performer than the Rafale and Grippen and the US will give them a price they cant refuse as well. As for India, I think that since they were able to actually test fly the MiG35 a couple months ago and already being familiar with the platform in addition to the much improved reliability and maintenance this version offers, not to mention it is substantially cheaper than the competition, India will choose the MiG for their replacement. The airframe life is now comparable to the F-18 at 6000+ hours and the modularization of the platform allows serviceability and maintenance that is nearly 3 times better than previous MiG29 versions. Being that HAL will also get to do a greater share of production work than the US or Sweden would allow also tends to favor the MiG. France did themselves in with their attitude the past couple years. I waited 2 weeks to get a lousy nose gear position/lock sensor for a Falcon 50 and the service center in Jersey said the excellent customer service people had come to expect from the French made Dassaults had fallen off some. Who knows whats up with them.",
