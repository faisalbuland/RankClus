Mr. Bush's Justice Dept. determined on 25 Sep 2001 that law enforcement did not need search warrants to conduct intelligence operations inside the U.S. because foreign intelligence constitutes \"national self defense.\" This was based on the rather interesting legal proposition that since U.S. courts had ruled that the use of \"deadly force\" in self defense is justifiable under the Fourth Amendment in that, \"if the government's heightened interest in self-defense justifies the use of deadly force, then it also must certainly justify warrantless searches.\" Not only is this convoluted legal application bereft of logic, it specifically contravened the FISA that forbid these exact same warrantless searches. If your personal desire is complete security and safety at all legal and civil costs, then simply endorse a complete autocratic government that will thoroughly \"protect\" you in \"assisting\" your comings and goings, sorting through your personal mail and your financial transactions, bank accounts, screening your personal contacts, business associates, and friends and family, etc. to ensure that no \"bad guys\" are using you to plan another attack, and perhaps even regular, unannounced official visits to your home and family to ensure that you haven't been \"brainwashed\" or have become an unknowing or unwilling dupe of the enemy in its attempts to undermine our safety again.

Mr. Bush's Justice Dept. determined on 25 Sep 2001 that law enforcement did not need search warrants to conduct intelligence operations inside the U.S. because foreign intelligence constitutes \"national self defense.\" This was based on the rather interesting legal proposition that since U.S. courts had ruled that the use of \"deadly force\" in self defense is justifiable under the Fourth Amendment in that, \"if the government's heightened interest in self-defense justifies the use of deadly force, then it also must certainly justify warrantless searches.\" Not only is this convoluted legal application bereft of logic, it specifically contravened the FISA that forbid these exact same warrantless searches. If your personal desire is complete security and safety at all legal and civil costs, then simply endorse a complete autocratic government that will thoroughly \"protect\" you in \"assisting\" your comings and goings, sorting through your personal mail and your financial transactions, bank accounts, screening your personal contacts, business associates, and friends and family, etc. to ensure that no \"bad guys\" are using you to plan another attack, and perhaps even regular, unannounced official visits to your home and family to ensure that you haven't been \"brainwashed\" or have become an unknowing or unwilling dupe of the enemy in its attempts to undermine our safety again. Yes, the total level of protection that you desire is certainly possible. Well, your post acts like I want to be protected from the little ole lady down the street. Using the context of the purpose for the previous administrations thought process I still agree with his decisions and trusted his integrity. We were not threatened by the little old lady. We were not threatened by a tangible enemy ie a government. We were not threatened by an enemy who stands up and says \"here we are\". So I ask again...faced with UNKNOWN THREATS who had successfully attacked a US warship, military compounds, embassies of various countries, and the world trade centers twice...what should the President have done? In an unknown environment with the worst form of attack possible he did the proper thing. Using the comfort of no follow up attacks is an unfair judgment. Do not be mistaken that I take our constitution for granted. But I would expect if we are attacked again as in 9/11 the Standing President has a duty to do whatever it takes to stop those attacks. After the threat is minimized then the policy is abandoned. You are making it out that Pres Bush came up with all this on his own when factually he had Government lawyers and members of Congress involved.",

Mr. Bush's Justice Dept. determined on 25 Sep 2001 that law enforcement did not need search warrants to conduct intelligence operations inside the U.S. because foreign intelligence constitutes \"national self defense.\" This was based on the rather interesting legal proposition that since U.S. courts had ruled that the use of \"deadly force\" in self defense is justifiable under the Fourth Amendment in that, \"if the government's heightened interest in self-defense justifies the use of deadly force, then it also must certainly justify warrantless searches.\" Not only is this convoluted legal application bereft of logic, it specifically contravened the FISA that forbid these exact same warrantless searches. If your personal desire is complete security and safety at all legal and civil costs, then simply endorse a complete autocratic government that will thoroughly \"protect\" you in \"assisting\" your comings and goings, sorting through your personal mail and your financial transactions, bank accounts, screening your personal contacts, business associates, and friends and family, etc. to ensure that no \"bad guys\" are using you to plan another attack, and perhaps even regular, unannounced official visits to your home and family to ensure that you haven't been \"brainwashed\" or have become an unknowing or unwilling dupe of the enemy in its attempts to undermine our safety again.

Using the context of the purpose for the previous administrations thought process I still agree with his decisions and trusted his integrity. We were not threatened by the little old lady. We were not threatened by a tangible enemy ie a government. We were not threatened by an enemy who stands up and says \"here we are\". So I ask again...faced with UNKNOWN THREATS who had successfully attacked a US warship, military compounds, embassies of various countries, and the world trade centers twice...what should the President have done? In an unknown environment with the worst form of attack possible he did the proper thing. Using the comfort of no follow up attacks is an unfair judgment. Do not be mistaken that I take our constitution for granted. But I would expect if we are attacked again as in 9/11 the Standing President has a duty to do whatever it takes to stop those attacks.
