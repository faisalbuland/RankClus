I was tired old the rain, the cold and the mud \u2013 that was in peace time in Germany. I jumped at the MOS change. I spent two tours in Vietnam. The first six months of my first tour, 11/67-11/68, was as and SFC E7, MOS 74D40 (at that time it was Data Processing Operations NCO). On Tet 68 I spent seven hours in the Qui Nhon airport exchanging fire with a group of NVA and/or VC during which time one of the GIs in the airport was KIA and two others were WIA. I fired about 60 rounds from my M14. I don\u2019t know idea if I hit anyone or not. Six months in to my first tour I was appointed a WO1 MOS 741A, at that time it was Data Processing Technician). Two soldiers who work directly for me were KIA, three others were WIA. My first assignment, in RVN after my WO1 appointment, I replaced a LT who was KIA just five days earlier. During the next six months another LT that I worked with KIA and two GIs in my section were medivaced WIA. On my second tour, 12/71-10/72, same MOS this time it was as a CW2. One GIs in my section was KIA. Two Korean civilians who worked for were killed. My two brothers both served in Korea and in Vietnam, one has a Bronze Star, Silver Star, two Purple hearts and a CIB (MOS 111) retired SFC. This brother told me when he went to Korea he wanted to be a hero, after the first night he just wanted to live long enough to go home in one piece. He is 50% disabled service connect combat related. The other brother has two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart (MOS 121) retired CSM 100% disabled all combat related. Male or female combat is not a place to find out if you\u2019re up it. It is a place where men women and all too often child have arms and legs ripped off and many die. My last assignment in the army was still in data processing in Hawaii, ((25ht Infantry Division) 1976-77 as a CW3. My Operations Sergeant was John F.

This morning my oldest daughter (USCG) and two of my granddaughters (her two daughters) )USCG and USAF) put on uniforms and did the job the military told them to do.
