Foster Barton Foster Barton, 19, of Grove City, received a Purple Heart for his military service in Iraq. He almost lost his leg last month after a Humvee he was riding in ran over a landmine. Barton said he was injured again Friday night in a crowded parking lot as he was leaving the Toby Keith concert at Germain Amphitheatre. The solider was injured so badly that he can't go back to Iraq as scheduled. \"I don't remember getting hit at all, really,\" said Barton, a member of the 1st Calvary Division. \"He hit me in the back of the head. I fell and hit the ground. I was knocked unconscious and he continued to punch and kick me on the ground.\" Barton and his family said he was beat up because he was wearing an Iraqi freedom T-shirt. \"It's not our fault,\" Barton said. \"I'm just doing a job.\" According to a Columbus police report, six witnesses who didn't know Barton said the person who beat him up was screaming profanities and making crude remarks about U.S. soldiers. \"http://www.newsnet5.com/news/3747416/detail.html\" First 1 or 2 isolated indents in a population of 300Mil does NOt make a pattern. Second Anti-Vet and Anti-war people being at a Toby Keith concert is unlikely. I think it is a LOT more likely he was picked just because he was seen as a easy target by some drunk AH looking to cause trouble and if the easy target had been wearing a code pink T shirt the attacker would have been screaming profanities and making crude remarks about anti-war protesters. ALWAYS go wth the SIMPLEST explaination that fits the facts. So 1 or 2 instances out of 350,000,000 doesn't make a pattern, but 247 out of 350,000,000 does? 247 is the number of physical violence \"hate crimes\" committed against people because of their sexual orientation in 2007. This number is from the FBI's website and 2007 is the most current year available. \"http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/table_04.htm\"",

Not so, some people kill or do it because they like it, it gives them a thrill, not just because they hate someone. And some people assault and/or kill others, believing that they really didn't commit a crime because the person they assaulted or killed was a homosexual or Hispanic or Black or a woman - which means the assault or murder was justified. For those whose panties are in a bunch because veterans weren't included - if you're a gay veteran or a veteran who someone believes is gay, you're a heck of a lot more likely to be attacked or killed than just because you're a veteran.",

The two young men on trial were acquitted because the prosecution couldn\u2019t prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the charges against the accused, third-degree murder and ethnic intimidation against the one and aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation against the other.
