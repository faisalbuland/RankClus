It's gonna split open and the sea is going to rusn in again creating another inland sea just like way back when.. But don't be alarmed - just don't live in any of these areas... oh, and lets not forget Yellowstone - it's gonna pop too NOW BE ALARMED. Thanks for allaying my fears! We have a little fault line here in Jersey, Ramapo faultline. Not very exciting, they(Lahmont-Doherty Observatory) doesn't expect any \"real\" activity. Just the way I like it!!",
