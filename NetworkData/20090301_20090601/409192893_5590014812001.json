Obama and his entire entourage has redefined the definition of hypocrisy and kicked it up 100 freaking notches\u2026 How arrogantly pathetic of these idiots to change the labeling \u2013 and just think \u2013 what if Chaney had said \u2013 ah yea \u2013 these are WOMAN-CAUSED \u2013 DISASTERS \u2013 gee that would-have gone over well\u2026 Osama Bin Laden and clan must rolling on their cave floors laughing at these idiots\u2026 Heck, his next freaking video will probably be taped from DC\u2026 At the rate Obama is going \u2013 people will calling for his impeachment by end of his second year\u2026 How in the world can he even stand it \u2013 people are committing suicide \u2013 entire families \u2013 and the sign a freaking PORK-BILL that would PAID\u2014OFF the \u201cso-called\u201d toxic assets but instead of helping the American People \u2013 they think it\u2019s best if they spend 95-BILLION DOLLARS on remodeling government buildings\u2026 Gee, I hope they make them \u201cMAN-CAUSED DISASTER\u201d proof\u2026? Wow\u2026 and to think we haven\u2019t even begun to feel the consequences from their addictive behavior\u2026 So, I guess everything was okay until 1-20-09... NOPE \u2013 nor did I say it was\u2026 If Obama wants to save any integrity whatsoever \u2013 he needs to drop the hammer on the idiots controlling his puppet strings in Congress. Nancy Pelosi \u2013 Reid \u2013 Schumer \u2013 and throw in as many republican names along with it \u2013 but HE BETTER do something because THEY are going to destroy this freaking country and it won\u2019t matter WHO IS sitting in the captain\u2019s seat! The despicable blatant lies coming out of DC about these bonuses\u2026 what disgrace\u2026 Think about it \u2013 Obama was raising taxes to the heights of the Jimmy Carter days \u2013 that was based upon the economy of LAST YEAR\u2026 He and the boneheads in congress just raised the fed deficit by SEVEN TIMES in the next say - 3-5 yrs. That\u2019s what is being forecast\u2026 WHERE WILL HE GET THAT MONEY\u2026? Can you pay seven times the amount of taxes you paid this year? And don\u2019t forget \u2013 while unemployment continually goes up \u2013 the fed loses income exponentially because they are not only paying out unemployment benefits but they are NOT receiving any income from these people\u2026 Think of it this way \u2013 if Bill Gates gave \u201cALL\u201d of his wealth \u2013 it would be smoked within a Per GAO Table Page 28 2005 - $ 318,000,000,000 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 per person = $ 1,046.06 2007 - $ 162,000,000,000 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 per person = $ 533.20 2008 - $ 455,000,000,000 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. per person = $ 1,497.57 2009 - $ 11,042,553,971,450.47 \u2026\u2026\u2026. per person = $ 36,345.16 Census Report 2008 - 303,824,640 People in the US Divide the each deficit amount by the amount of people in the US and tell me if you think that\u2019s okay \u2013 we\u2019ll get through it? What\u2019s the average wage/salary in the US today\u2026? How many people even earn 36k per year\u2026? That is a LOT OF MONEY! And the worse part about it is \u2013 there will be less people working to even contribute to paying it down\u2026. Look at the bright side - NOW we KNOW why the Socialist countries couldh't make it work - so maybe - just maybe Obama and clan will give up their Socialist Agenda... or maybe not?",

Isnt it just possible that some were just rounded up along with the bad guys during the invasion? wow - you really don't get it... this isn't about Bush - it's not even about Obama... Why have the democrats even kept corporate taxes down while the economy is belching and puking... because they know that's the only thing saving their ass right now... but that won't last because they are spending more money than we MAKE...! Those are NOT fake or even exaggerated numbers - THEY ARE REAL... Can you afford to pay 36-thousand dollars for person in your house? That isn't hype - read what real economists are saying... Unemployment will double - then triple because businesses are already looking to BAIL... They are not staying to be raped by the democrats while they can go to Europe or south and survive...? There are estimates that the Fed will be forced to DOUBLE their income taxes within the next 3-4 yrs just to keep up with the payments... If they pump money into the system - inflation will go through the roof. Forget about Bush - Chaney - if you look at those numbers you'll see they were moving in the right direction - EXCEPT - someone has been sitting on these toxic loans - and guess who sits on the OVER-SIGHT COMMITTEE - Barney Franks... They were warned over 20 separate times from CLINTON - BUSH - GREENSPAN - and quite a few other economists ALL THROUGH THE BUSH YEARS and the last half of Clintons. 9-TRILLION DOLLARS - Google that puppy up one time... The interest payment on that freaking thing is beyond what we can produce. If the Fed was forced to use the same accounting regulatoins as normal businesses and banks - that 9-TRILLION DOLLARS would be REPORTED as a horrendous 56-TRILLION DOLLARS - because THAT is what it TRULY IS...

I keep hearing about this pork and nonsensecal programs hes funding and Im not one bit surprised. Unless youve lived in a box all your life you would understand thats how the real world works. You buy support so you can be in a position to make change, The changes that benefit the people. Try doing it any other way and you would never be in any position to do anything. Results are all that matter. Post again in a year when you understand what has happened and how little he had to work with. As far as the enemy combatants do you actually believe all of them were guilty? Isnt it just possible that some were just rounded up along with the bad guys during the invasion?", 
        "reply": " wow - you really don't get it... this isn't about Bush - it's not even about Obama... Why have the democrats even kept corporate taxes down while the economy is belching and puking... because they know that's the only thing saving their ass right now... but that won't last because they are spending more money than we MAKE...! Those are NOT fake or even exaggerated numbers - THEY ARE REAL... Can you afford to pay 36-thousand dollars for person in your house? That isn't hype - read what real economists are saying... Unemployment will double - then triple because businesses are already looking to BAIL... They are not staying to be raped by the democrats while they can go to Europe or south and survive...? There are estimates that the Fed will be forced to DOUBLE their income taxes within the next 3-4 yrs just to keep up with the payments... If they pump money into the system - inflation will go through the roof. Forget about Bush - Chaney - if you look at those numbers you'll see they were moving in the right direction - EXCEPT - someone has been sitting on these toxic loans - and guess who sits on the OVER-SIGHT COMMITTEE - Barney Franks... They were warned over 20 separate times from CLINTON - BUSH - GREENSPAN - and quite a few other economists ALL THROUGH THE BUSH YEARS and the last half of Clintons. 9-TRILLION DOLLARS - Google that puppy up one time... The interest payment on that freaking thing is beyond what we can produce. If the Fed was forced to use the same accounting regulatoins as normal businesses and banks - that 9-TRILLION DOLLARS would be REPORTED as a horrendous 56-TRILLION DOLLARS - because THAT is what it TRULY IS...
