HOWEVER, one must be very careful about the company and it's track record. There are good companies out there like: Mary Kay, Amway, Avon and others. But there are many scams out there and they continue to rise up today especially in today's economic situation. Give a company due process...be careful and remember that over 6000 of those companies have come and gone in the last 5 years.",

        "content": "I think Network Marketing can work, but the problem is that alot of companies stress recruiting new sales reps, rather than actually selling the product(s) the company offers. If a company pays you $3 to sell a product and $15 to recruit a new sales rep, what do you think people are going to do? They spend all of their time recruiting, and the company becomes a pyramid scheme, even if thats not how it was intended to be run. I think that the whole \"The entire world must be in my downline\" attitude is a major flaw in alot of the mentality in the industry, but thats just me. That said I've met some really good people in Network marketing, and I've also met people that would sell their kids to make a buck if they could.",
