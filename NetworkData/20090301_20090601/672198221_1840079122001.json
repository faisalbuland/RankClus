The US is also in need of modernization, but lacks the funding to do everything it wants. The fact is that even great weapon systems get old and worn out. The US navy has signed on to purchase the F-35 even though it doesn't have supercruise capability like the F-22. Seems like supercruise is over rated.",

Wouldnt surprise me if they had. The J10 wasnt successful until after they got an F16 from Chavez and the J11 is a clone of the Su27 series that still needs Russian engines as the chinese made ones still eat themselves. Unless they have stolen something from the US then I cant see them with any supercruise aircraft any time in the next 15 years. As the J-11 and J-10 prove, even then thats no guarantee of quick success.",
