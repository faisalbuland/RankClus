New presidents are allotted $100,000 to overhaul the White House residence and the Oval Office, and the Obamas hired Hollywood decorator Michael S. Smith (known, per his site, for mixing \u201cOld World classicism with very contemporary settings\u201d). But the First Couple isn\u2019t spending that money. They \u201care not using public funds or accepting donations of goods for redecorating their private quarters,\u201d says Camille Johnston, director of communications for the First Lady. Nor is the couple, who reported $4.2 million in household income in 2007 tax returns, using money from the White House Historical Association, a privately funded foundation that paid for a $74,000 set of china shortly before Laura Bush left town. But does this mean they\u2019re going to spend more than $100,000 or less? Though Michelle Obama has talked up Pottery Barn, Smith\u2019s client list includes cost-is-no-object types like Rupert Murdoch, Steven Spielberg, and former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain\u2014for whom he procured that $87,783 rug. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that he\u2019ll get it done in the way that it\u2019s supposed to be done,\u201d says Smith client and Democratic donor Katherine Chez. \u201cBut how, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The White House declined to disclose the budget, saying that all expenses would remain private as a result of the Obamas\u2019 decision to absorb the cost.",
