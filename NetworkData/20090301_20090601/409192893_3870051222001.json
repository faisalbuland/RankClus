Well, you're not the first nor will you be the last to think that I'm wrong, and you're right. LOL. My original post (repeated here for you) was to poke some factious sarcasm at JTP. Nothing more, nothing less. Whaetever else in your mind that you wish to read into it, is up to you. I will say this, and it's only MHO. But if the pubs want to run on the same old ticket that included the same old cast of charcacters in camp McCain, they will lose big time in 2012! And by all means add Limbaugh/Coulter to this tragic comedy. I have no problem with that. As to continue harping on last year's campaign, that's not my tea party. But I'm fully aware that beating an old subject is popular past time here. And BTW, if you're concerned about the technicality of \"JTP attacks\" against the President, these actually started when J was campaigning with Mc/Pal. That was after the face off with then Senator Obama. But not to worry, J is still around as witnessed by the recent TP events. He has become qute a celebrity in his own right, and a very vocal advocate against the POTUS. I know that excites alot of people on the Right. So be it. My response is simply Bring it On!

JMHO, but if President Obama is approximately 50% sucessful in coming through with his election promises, and the economy starts making a recovery in late 2010; and with troops finally coming home from Iraq, I expect him to be reelected in 2012. No one in their right mind, expects the POTUS to be 100% on track with campaign promises made last year, except maybe some extreme lefties, of which I am not. Arlen Specter defected in the Senate. Al Franken will eventually win his Senate seat despite the Coleman law suits. People like Jack Murtha, Nancy Pelosi, and John Kerry who the Right loves to hate, always end up being reelected. Despite being hated by most rural and red state areas of the country, these folks are very popular in their own states of origin. I don't see that changing at all. A matter of fact, I see the Congress not only staying Democrat in 2010, but also gaining more House and Senate seats. You and I will always be on a different page. When I listened to the President's press conference yesterday from the East Wing, I heard him answer questions from reporters and did so in his hallmark intelligent and eloquent way. He just gets better and better! I like Robert Gibbs, and even though it is \"sometimes\" the duty of the Press Secretary to give a spin, for the most part he answers 'very tough qustions' in a positive, articulate, and informative way. That must be the toughest job of all to be WH-PRSEC. During Bush, Tony Snow often got caught up in that same spin cycle. That said, I'll take Gibbs anyday over Snow! And, if supporting a national health care system, while supporting Social Security in govt. rather than private sector, makes me a Socialist, then I have no problem with that. For those who take it one step further and call me a Soviet Marxist Leninist; that's when I have a problem with labels! No one can accurately predict what the future holds for our political system. 2010 is upon us, and 2012 is still a good ways down the road. So we're all making predictions and assmuptions based on what we already know. Many things unpredictable can and will happen in the meantime. You can bank on it!

Well, you're not the first nor will you be the last to think that I'm wrong, and you're right. LOL. My original post (repeated here for you) was to poke some factious sarcasm at JTP. Nothing more, nothing less. Whaetever else in your mind that you wish to read into it, is up to you. I will say this, and it's only MHO. But if the pubs want to run on the same old ticket that included the same old cast of charcacters in camp McCain, they will lose big time in 2012! And by all means add Limbaugh/Coulter to this tragic comedy. I have no problem with that. As to continue harping on last year's campaign, that's not my tea party. But I'm fully aware that beating an old subject is popular past time here. And BTW, if you're concerned about the technicality of \"JTP attacks\" against the President, these actually started when J was campaigning with Mc/Pal. That was after the face off with then Senator Obama. But not to worry, J is still around as witnessed by the recent TP events. He has become qute a celebrity in his own right, and a very vocal advocate against the POTUS. I know that excites alot of people on the Right. So be it. My response is simply Bring it On!

JMHO, but if President Obama is approximately 50% sucessful in coming through with his election promises, and the economy starts making a recovery in late 2010; and with troops finally coming home from Iraq, I expect him to be reelected in 2012. No one in their right mind, expects the POTUS to be 100% on track with campaign promises made last year, except maybe some extreme lefties, of which I am not. Arlen Specter defected in the Senate. Al Franken will eventually win his Senate seat despite the Coleman law suits. People like Jack Murtha, Nancy Pelosi, and John Kerry who the Right loves to hate, always end up being reelected. Despite being hated by most rural and red state areas of the country, these folks are very popular in their own states of origin. I don't see that changing at all. A matter of fact, I see the Congress not only staying Democrat in 2010, but also gaining more House and Senate seats. You and I will always be on a different page. When I listened to the President's press conference yesterday from the East Wing, I heard him answer questions from reporters and did so in his hallmark intelligent and eloquent way. He just gets better and better! I like Robert Gibbs, and even though it is \"sometimes\" the duty of the Press Secretary to give a spin, for the most part he answers 'very tough qustions' in a positive, articulate, and informative way. That must be the toughest job of all to be WH-PRSEC. During Bush, Tony Snow often got caught up in that same spin cycle. That said, I'll take Gibbs anyday over Snow! And, if supporting a national health care system, while supporting Social Security in govt. rather than private sector, makes me a Socialist, then I have no problem with that. For those who take it one step further and call me a Soviet Marxist Leninist; that's when I have a problem with labels! No one can accurately predict what the future holds for our political system. 2010 is upon us, and 2012 is still a good ways down the road. So we're all making predictions and assmuptions based on what we already know. Many things unpredictable can and will happen in the meantime. You can bank on it!

Now the fight today is trying to stop the juggernaut of the masses who historically are tardREs as the masses conglomerate. Interesting. Well, you're not the first nor will you be the last to think that I'm wrong, and you're right. LOL. My original post (repeated here for you) was to poke some factious sarcasm at JTP. Nothing more, nothing less. Whaetever else in your mind that you wish to read into it, is up to you. I will say this, and it's only MHO. But if the pubs want to run on the same old ticket that included the same old cast of charcacters in camp McCain, they will lose big time in 2012! And by all means add Limbaugh/Coulter to this tragic comedy. I have no problem with that. As to continue harping on last year's campaign, that's not my tea party. But I'm fully aware that beating an old subject is popular past time here. And BTW, if you're concerned about the technicality of \"JTP attacks\" against the President, these actually started when J was campaigning with Mc/Pal. That was after the face off with then Senator Obama. But not to worry, J is still around as witnessed by the recent TP events. He has become qute a celebrity in his own right, and a very vocal advocate against the POTUS. I know that excites alot of people on the Right. So be it. My response is simply Bring it On!

        "reply": " Interesting. Well, you're not the first nor will you be the last to think that I'm wrong, and you're right. LOL. My original post (repeated here for you) was to poke some factious sarcasm at JTP. Nothing more, nothing less. Whaetever else in your mind that you wish to read into it, is up to you. I will say this, and it's only MHO. But if the pubs want to run on the same old ticket that included the same old cast of charcacters in camp McCain, they will lose big time in 2012! And by all means add Limbaugh/Coulter to this tragic comedy. I have no problem with that. As to continue harping on last year's campaign, that's not my tea party. But I'm fully aware that beating an old subject is popular past time here. And BTW, if you're concerned about the technicality of \"JTP attacks\" against the President, these actually started when J was campaigning with Mc/Pal. That was after the face off with then Senator Obama. But not to worry, J is still around as witnessed by the recent TP events. He has become qute a celebrity in his own right, and a very vocal advocate against the POTUS. I know that excites alot of people on the Right. So be it. My response is simply Bring it On!

JMHO, but if President Obama is approximately 50% sucessful in coming through with his election promises, and the economy starts making a recovery in late 2010; and with troops finally coming home from Iraq, I expect him to be reelected in 2012. No one in their right mind, expects the POTUS to be 100% on track with campaign promises made last year, except maybe some extreme lefties, of which I am not. Arlen Specter defected in the Senate. Al Franken will eventually win his Senate seat despite the Coleman law suits. People like Jack Murtha, Nancy Pelosi, and John Kerry who the Right loves to hate, always end up being reelected. Despite being hated by most rural and red state areas of the country, these folks are very popular in their own states of origin. I don't see that changing at all. A matter of fact, I see the Congress not only staying Democrat in 2010, but also gaining more House and Senate seats. You and I will always be on a different page. When I listened to the President's press conference yesterday from the East Wing, I heard him answer questions from reporters and did so in his hallmark intelligent and eloquent way. He just gets better and better! I like Robert Gibbs, and even though it is \"sometimes\" the duty of the Press Secretary to give a spin, for the most part he answers 'very tough qustions' in a positive, articulate, and informative way. That must be the toughest job of all to be WH-PRSEC. During Bush, Tony Snow often got caught up in that same spin cycle. That said, I'll take Gibbs anyday over Snow! And, if supporting a national health care system, while supporting Social Security in govt. rather than private sector, makes me a Socialist, then I have no problem with that. For those who take it one step further and call me a Soviet Marxist Leninist; that's when I have a problem with labels! No one can accurately predict what the future holds for our political system. 2010 is upon us, and 2012 is still a good ways down the road. So we're all making predictions and assmuptions based on what we already know. Many things unpredictable can and will happen in the meantime. You can bank on it! Perhaps even a \"3rd\" US political party might evolve to challenge the other two? And if it does, God knows what page we'll be on? You and I might still be able to find \"some\" common ground...... No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.
