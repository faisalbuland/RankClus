Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal said: \"The rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, already hobbled by years of delays and infighting, is facing fresh problems as private developer Larry Silverstein asks the government for crucial financial assistance.\" The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government entity that owns the site, is eager to prevent the project from stalling, and is considering helping to finance at least one of Silverstein's planned three office towers, WSJ added quoting sources. Silverstein is requesting financing help on at least two of the three towers. The project, meant to be a symbol of the recovery after the September 11 terrorist attacks, has been through years of costly delays and acrimony. The plan for the 16-acre site includes five skyscrapers, a memorial, a transit hub, a shopping mall and a performing-arts center. Much of that was recently expected to open between 2011 and 2013.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal said: \"The rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, already hobbled by years of delays and infighting, is facing fresh problems as private developer Larry Silverstein asks the government for crucial financial assistance.\" The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government entity that owns the site, is eager to prevent the project from stalling, and is considering helping to finance at least one of Silverstein's planned three office towers, WSJ added quoting sources. Silverstein is requesting financing help on at least two of the three towers. The project, meant to be a symbol of the recovery after the September 11 terrorist attacks, has been through years of costly delays and acrimony. The plan for the 16-acre site includes five skyscrapers, a memorial, a transit hub, a shopping mall and a performing-arts center. Much of that was recently expected to open between 2011 and 2013.
