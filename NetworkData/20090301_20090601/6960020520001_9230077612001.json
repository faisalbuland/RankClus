How about cutting out pork attachments- how many billions are their on the new budget/ cut politican's pay & benefits- they get life long pensions after serving 1 term- pay little SS and get free med care fro life-please. Let's stop paying the UN till they get their act together- seen how much they have wasted lately. For this idiot's propsal- just check the number of military & civilian deaths from WWI & WWII - it's millions, because this nation & others thought dictators & tryants were someone else's problem till it was too late.",

Note that GW Bush (during his presidential compaign) spent a lot of time howling about how imperialist the Clinton Administration was, and how \"national building\" was an awful waste of resources. Then after being elected put us into an unwarrented conflict with Iraq, dreaming about spreading democracy throughout the middle east. Ironic, isn't it? We already have victory in Iraq (if you listen to the neocons) but the new president is being pragmatic about how we go about removing ourselves from where we never should've committed ourselves to begin with. Afganistan needs to be helped, but the Bush Administration made a serious mistake by not committing the forces/resources necessary to nail Bin Laden. That country isn't even qualified as a 3rd world country - it is barely out of the stone age - so the US needs to determine what resolution is acceptable, determine a plan for executing on that goal, and then getting out. W/r/t our weapons sytems and other stuff: The M-16 is 40 years old - but it has also been improved considerably over the years and remains an effective weapon. [For the guys that are using this weapon today: do you consider this weapon still viable? Do you believe that it really needs replacement? - I haven't shot one for a long time] The C-130 we have today remains a versatile airframe that has been updated continuously ever since its invention. If it is so effective, why replace it? The removal of pork attachments would garner some relatively minor benefits, which was made into a huge campaign issue despite the tiny amount of money that would be saved (the republicans tend to make huge amounts of noise about small things). Note that the republicans made the \"line-item veto\" law that was to take effect after the Clinton Administration was voted out of office. It hadn't occured to them that Clinton would beat Bob Dole, and then Clinton had a law to use against the republicans (until the supreme court deemed it unconstitutional). I would prefer that the republicans learn to take a longer term view of their actions - because what they've been doing over the past few decades isn't working... But I digress. Health care is a major problem in our nation, and I believe that you are correct in this respect with one change: Members of our houses of representatives should lose their health care and benefits just like anyone else that changes jobs at the end of their terms or retirement, until our health system is completely fixed because the costs are killing us. That includes care for our elderly, veterans, and citizens. There is no good reason to not consolidate these resources and nationalize the system, because health care for profit has proven disastrous. The UN certainly has its problems - but there are things the UN can do that even the Bush Administration reluctantly determined the US could not. And the amount of money we give them each year is pitifully small in the grand scheme of things.",
