All it took was one old gentleman standing in solemn respect and it spread from there. ++http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/world/europe/19wootton.html?_r=2&ref=europe quote: WOOTTON BASSETT, England \u2014 It started two years ago, the first time a military hearse carrying the body of a slain British soldier drove through town. An elderly man stood silent and alone by the side of the road, saluting as the coffin went by. \u201cIt was a shocking, heart-wrenching experience,\u201d said Sarah Dunn, who is 36 and works at a real estate office here. \u201cSeeing the sight of the coffin actually go past, and seeing the gentleman out there.\u201d No one ever really discussed it. But the next time a soldier\u2019s hearse drove by on its way from Lyneham Royal Air Force Base to a hospital morgue in Oxford, Miss Dunn, her co-workers and most of the shopkeepers along the street quietly went outside and showed their respect by lining up to watch it pass, too. They have done it dozens of times since then, part of a growing crowd that now includes local residents, military veterans and others from across the country. Britain withdrew from Iraq at the end of April, but it still has 8,300 troops in Afghanistan, waging a war few people understand and fewer still support. The impromptu commemorations in this Wiltshire market town have provided a poignant reminder that, however unpopular and quixotic their mission, soldiers are still fighting, and still dying, for Britain... Earlier casualties of war were flown to a different air base. Lyneham became the primary site for casualties in 2007, when the hearses began coming through Wootton Bassett. \u201cI think a lot of other parts of the country aren\u2019t really aware of the war,\u201d said Carol Lacey, who works at a stationery store on the main street. (...) Wootton Bassett has become famous for its response to the hearses in a country that seems at times to wish the whole thing would just go away. At one point, someone proposed renaming the main street \u201cHighway of Heroes\u201d to make it official. The townspeople balked, saying that they were just doing what any decent people would do and that they didn\u2019t want to draw attention to themselves. Miss Dunn, the real estate agent, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous idea, because it takes the emphasis off of the soldiers. They\u2019re the ones who are remarkable, not us.\u201d Pat Mackie, who is 60 and owns a gift shop in town, said \u201cpeople are doing it unconditionally, not for any other reason.\u201d One repatriation took place during a bell-ringing practice at the church, and the sound seemed so fitting that now the bells are rung whenever a new hearse reaches the edge of town. (...) The hearses carried the coffins of Cpl. Kumar Pun, 31; Sgt. Ben Ross, 34; Rifleman Adrian Sheldon, 25; and Cpl. Sean Binnie, 22. (...) George Brooks, 61, who had served in the Royal Air Force and had traveled down from Bristol, as he always does for repatriations, said that when battalions came home from war they were welcomed and given parades. \u201cBut these lads have nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is their parade.\u201d",

Actually WWII is a pretty safe bet, the majority of men who were over 18 and under 40 in 1943 will have served in one or other of the forces and a significant proportion of the rest will have been something almost equally arduous like Bevin Boys or firemen.",

Then it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' \"Tommy, 'ow's yer soul?\" But it's \"Thin red line of 'eroes\" when the drums begin to roll, The drums begin to roll, my boys, the drums begin to roll, O it's \"Thin red line of 'eroes\" when the drums begin to roll. The poem sort of sums-up the British respect for it soldiers, its \"Tommy Atkins\". Always like Kipling, he was a soldier's poet. Who can forget........... So I'll meet'im later on at a place where'e is gone- Where it's always double drill and no canteen; E'll be squattin on the coals, an' I'll get a swig in hell from Gunga Din. Yes, Din! Din! Din! You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din Though I've belted you and flayed you, by the livin Gawd that made you You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!",

Of course the Reps will call this picture dishonorable and a disgrace. The major reason why I have a problem with taking pictures of the flag draped coffins and publishing them is because it opens the door for anyone, regardless of what side of the political spectrum you are, to use them to further their own political agenda and/or opinions. YOU just made it a disgrace by using it to further your own political agenda, even if it is only an opinion. Why couldn't you just honor those men and just keep the politics out of it? I don't call the picture dishonorable or a disgrace. Just the person who uses it politically. So expressing a salute and an oppinon of honor and respect is being disrespectful or stating why people find such dishonorable and disrespectful is being dishonorable or disrespectful? I think not. Now if I came out and said hey look at all these dead military personnel we need to get out now or something to that effect, then I think that has crossed the line. You remind me of my teenage daughter. She is purposely obtuse about things too. I find you throwing your political babble right after your salute to be the problem. It is like apologizing for something and then adding \"but..........\". Just do the \"hand salute\" and keep the political rambling out of it.",
