Problem is he was carrying a sheaf of dossiers and an exposed printed sheet. That sheet bore the outline of a proposed security action against a terrorist cell in Manchester. Once it was out there, police had no choice than to move up their operation,which they did, or scrub it. The officer has been asked to step down. This message has been edited.
