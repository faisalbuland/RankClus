A similar number believed that it was all right for a man to slap his wife or girlfriend if she is \u201cnagging or constantly moaning at him\u201d. The findings of the poll, conducted for the Home Office, also disclosed about a quarter of people believe that wearing sexy or revealing clothing should lead to a woman being held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted. Although a majority of 1,065 people over 18 questioned last month believe that it is never acceptable to hit or slap a woman, the poll found that those aged 25-39 were more likely to consider that there were circumstances in which it was acceptable to hit or slap a woman. Men and women over 65 and those in the lower social class groups D and E are more likely to believe that woman should be held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted, Ipsos Mori telephone poll found. Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d Ms Smith said that more needed to be done to challenge attitudes that condoned violence against women and girls. She was speaking as she launched a police lead review of whether new laws are needed to tackle serial domestic violence abuses and whether there is a link between the early sexualisation of young girls and violent abuse. One idea being considered is to allow women to ask police if a new partner has a record of domestic violence. A pilot scheme that allows women to request information on whether a new partner has a history of child sex abuse is currently underway in four police force areas of England and Wales. But Ms Smith was confronted at a working breakfast at which she launched the campaign by a veteran domestic violence campaigner. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, accused Ms Smith over breakfast at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster of using \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cspin\u201d. She said that government action so far had been \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and condemned plans for a database of serial domestic abusers. Ms Horley said: \u201cWe have had enough talking \u2013 we need action. As for the perpetrators\u2019 register, it is a gimmick and doesn\u2019t address the root problem. \u201cThe majority of violent men don\u2019t come to the attention of police and it won\u2019t keep women safe. \u201cPolice can\u2019t be expected to monitor relationships and love lives of offenders.\u201d She went on: \u201dThe Government is hoping to get away with useless initiatives like this register and it is hypocritical to sound tough and do little.\u201d She said that the cases of Sabina Akhtar and Katie Summers showed that not enough was being done. Ms Smith tried to interrupt the tirade but was shouted down before Vera Baird, the solicitor general, stepped in to argue the Government\u2019s case. \"It is the weak who are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong\" -- Leo Roskin",

Having been a law enforcement person, I've seen BOTH sides of the coin. Neither is pleasant, but the female offenders were/are often worse than many of the males. Setting their victims on fire, throwing scalding water on them and disfiguring them, cutting or cutting off extremities(guess what), throwing hot iron skillets at them, destroying costly property, etc. The media does not feel fit to display that side of the equation. However, it is a stark reality. In any event, any acts of abuse perpetrated by ANYONE are unacceptable. The best thing to avoid any such hassles is to stay single and avoid complicated entanglements with members of the opposite sex. One never knows about the mental \"baggage\" another person carries. One person's peace of mind is truly priceless, and easily compromised or lost by another person's intrusions and attempts to deprive them of that peace of mind. Sadly, the frailties of being human manifest themselves in many negative ways. Governments cannot ever legislate away stupidity or imprudence. Being accountable for one's actions is a solution. The \"blame\" falls on both sides, but it is never clearly black-and-white, easily differentiated or simple. That someone should be oppressed, harrassed or deprived of their liberties or happiness because others take offense or CHOOSE to be 'offended', as in the female Southwest passenger, is a sign that there are serious inhibitions and mental issues to be dealt with. Who CARES how someone else decides to dress? So WHAT! Get over it! If ya don't like it, DON'T LOOK AT IT! No one is holding a gun to anyone's head and FORCING those others to look! How clearly immature and peevishly intolerant are we being? I think we all need to leave others alone and get on with our own lives. When we try to impose our will and our limitations and inhibitions on others, this is called exercising unrighteous dominion over others. We are no better than closed-minded terrorists if we cannot leave others well enough alone. GET OVER IT and get on with your life! Deal with your own personal inhibitions...don't make them someone else's unwanted limitations because of an internal conflict/inferiority complex or a desire to make someone else as unhappy as you are. If some person dresses/acts in a way you don't like, ask yourself if you would like someone else to decide/judge how YOU dress and think, and force THEIR way upon you...put the shoe on the other foot. Leave him/her alone. Get over your quirky insecurities and your impulsive desire to force your views and your will on someone else who may not choose to see the world the way you do. That's not liberty. That's not right. Live and let live. Go your own way in peace. Deal with your personal inner conflicts and limitations yourself. Don't make them into someone else's misery because of your own insecurity, intolerance or your inability to accept others as they are.",

A similar number believed that it was all right for a man to slap his wife or girlfriend if she is \u201cnagging or constantly moaning at him\u201d. The findings of the poll, conducted for the Home Office, also disclosed about a quarter of people believe that wearing sexy or revealing clothing should lead to a woman being held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted. Although a majority of 1,065 people over 18 questioned last month believe that it is never acceptable to hit or slap a woman, the poll found that those aged 25-39 were more likely to consider that there were circumstances in which it was acceptable to hit or slap a woman. Men and women over 65 and those in the lower social class groups D and E are more likely to believe that woman should be held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted, Ipsos Mori telephone poll found. Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d Ms Smith said that more needed to be done to challenge attitudes that condoned violence against women and girls. She was speaking as she launched a police lead review of whether new laws are needed to tackle serial domestic violence abuses and whether there is a link between the early sexualisation of young girls and violent abuse. One idea being considered is to allow women to ask police if a new partner has a record of domestic violence. A pilot scheme that allows women to request information on whether a new partner has a history of child sex abuse is currently underway in four police force areas of England and Wales. But Ms Smith was confronted at a working breakfast at which she launched the campaign by a veteran domestic violence campaigner. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, accused Ms Smith over breakfast at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster of using \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cspin\u201d. She said that government action so far had been \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and condemned plans for a database of serial domestic abusers. Ms Horley said: \u201cWe have had enough talking \u2013 we need action. As for the perpetrators\u2019 register, it is a gimmick and doesn\u2019t address the root problem. \u201cThe majority of violent men don\u2019t come to the attention of police and it won\u2019t keep women safe. \u201cPolice can\u2019t be expected to monitor relationships and love lives of offenders.\u201d She went on: \u201dThe Government is hoping to get away with useless initiatives like this register and it is hypocritical to sound tough and do little.\u201d She said that the cases of Sabina Akhtar and Katie Summers showed that not enough was being done. Ms Smith tried to interrupt the tirade but was shouted down before Vera Baird, the solicitor general, stepped in to argue the Government\u2019s case. \"It is the weak who are cruel.

That someone should be oppressed, harrassed or deprived of their liberties or happiness because others take offense or CHOOSE to be 'offended', as in the female Southwest passenger, is a sign that there are serious inhibitions and mental issues to be dealt with.

A similar number believed that it was all right for a man to slap his wife or girlfriend if she is \u201cnagging or constantly moaning at him\u201d. The findings of the poll, conducted for the Home Office, also disclosed about a quarter of people believe that wearing sexy or revealing clothing should lead to a woman being held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted. Although a majority of 1,065 people over 18 questioned last month believe that it is never acceptable to hit or slap a woman, the poll found that those aged 25-39 were more likely to consider that there were circumstances in which it was acceptable to hit or slap a woman. Men and women over 65 and those in the lower social class groups D and E are more likely to believe that woman should be held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted, Ipsos Mori telephone poll found. Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d Ms Smith said that more needed to be done to challenge attitudes that condoned violence against women and girls. She was speaking as she launched a police lead review of whether new laws are needed to tackle serial domestic violence abuses and whether there is a link between the early sexualisation of young girls and violent abuse. One idea being considered is to allow women to ask police if a new partner has a record of domestic violence. A pilot scheme that allows women to request information on whether a new partner has a history of child sex abuse is currently underway in four police force areas of England and Wales. But Ms Smith was confronted at a working breakfast at which she launched the campaign by a veteran domestic violence campaigner. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, accused Ms Smith over breakfast at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster of using \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cspin\u201d. She said that government action so far had been \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and condemned plans for a database of serial domestic abusers. Ms Horley said: \u201cWe have had enough talking \u2013 we need action. As for the perpetrators\u2019 register, it is a gimmick and doesn\u2019t address the root problem. \u201cThe majority of violent men don\u2019t come to the attention of police and it won\u2019t keep women safe. \u201cPolice can\u2019t be expected to monitor relationships and love lives of offenders.\u201d She went on: \u201dThe Government is hoping to get away with useless initiatives like this register and it is hypocritical to sound tough and do little.\u201d She said that the cases of Sabina Akhtar and Katie Summers showed that not enough was being done. Ms Smith tried to interrupt the tirade but was shouted down before Vera Baird, the solicitor general, stepped in to argue the Government\u2019s case. \"It is the weak who are cruel.

A similar number believed that it was all right for a man to slap his wife or girlfriend if she is \u201cnagging or constantly moaning at him\u201d. The findings of the poll, conducted for the Home Office, also disclosed about a quarter of people believe that wearing sexy or revealing clothing should lead to a woman being held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted. Although a majority of 1,065 people over 18 questioned last month believe that it is never acceptable to hit or slap a woman, the poll found that those aged 25-39 were more likely to consider that there were circumstances in which it was acceptable to hit or slap a woman. Men and women over 65 and those in the lower social class groups D and E are more likely to believe that woman should be held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted, Ipsos Mori telephone poll found. Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d Ms Smith said that more needed to be done to challenge attitudes that condoned violence against women and girls. She was speaking as she launched a police lead review of whether new laws are needed to tackle serial domestic violence abuses and whether there is a link between the early sexualisation of young girls and violent abuse. One idea being considered is to allow women to ask police if a new partner has a record of domestic violence. A pilot scheme that allows women to request information on whether a new partner has a history of child sex abuse is currently underway in four police force areas of England and Wales. But Ms Smith was confronted at a working breakfast at which she launched the campaign by a veteran domestic violence campaigner. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, accused Ms Smith over breakfast at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster of using \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cspin\u201d. She said that government action so far had been \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and condemned plans for a database of serial domestic abusers. Ms Horley said: \u201cWe have had enough talking \u2013 we need action. As for the perpetrators\u2019 register, it is a gimmick and doesn\u2019t address the root problem. \u201cThe majority of violent men don\u2019t come to the attention of police and it won\u2019t keep women safe. \u201cPolice can\u2019t be expected to monitor relationships and love lives of offenders.\u201d She went on: \u201dThe Government is hoping to get away with useless initiatives like this register and it is hypocritical to sound tough and do little.\u201d She said that the cases of Sabina Akhtar and Katie Summers showed that not enough was being done. Ms Smith tried to interrupt the tirade but was shouted down before Vera Baird, the solicitor general, stepped in to argue the Government\u2019s case. \"It is the weak who are cruel.

Having been a law enforcement person, I've seen BOTH sides of the coin. Neither is pleasant, but the female offenders were/are often worse than many of the males. Setting their victims on fire, throwing scalding water on them and disfiguring them, cutting or cutting off extremities(guess what), throwing hot iron skillets at them, destroying costly property, etc. The media does not feel fit to display that side of the equation. However, it is a stark reality. In any event, any acts of abuse perpetrated by ANYONE are unacceptable. The best thing to avoid any such hassles is to stay single and avoid complicated entanglements with members of the opposite sex. One never knows about the mental \"baggage\" another person carries. One person's peace of mind is truly priceless, and easily compromised or lost by another person's intrusions and attempts to deprive them of that peace of mind. Sadly, the frailties of being human manifest themselves in many negative ways. Governments cannot ever legislate away stupidity or imprudence. Being accountable for one's actions is a solution. The \"blame\" falls on both sides, but it is never clearly black-and-white, easily differentiated or simple. That someone should be oppressed, harrassed or deprived of their liberties or happiness because others take offense or CHOOSE to be 'offended', as in the female Southwest passenger, is a sign that there are serious inhibitions and mental issues to be dealt with. Who CARES how someone else decides to dress? So WHAT! Get over it! If ya don't like it, DON'T LOOK AT IT! No one is holding a gun to anyone's head and FORCING those others to look! How clearly immature and peevishly intolerant are we being? I think we all need to leave others alone and get on with our own lives. When we try to impose our will and our limitations and inhibitions on others, this is called exercising unrighteous dominion over others. We are no better than closed-minded terrorists if we cannot leave others well enough alone. GET OVER IT and get on with your life! Deal with your own personal inhibitions...don't make them someone else's unwanted limitations because of an internal conflict/inferiority complex or a desire to make someone else as unhappy as you are. If some person dresses/acts in a way you don't like, ask yourself if you would like someone else to decide/judge how YOU dress and think, and force THEIR way upon you...put the shoe on the other foot. Leave him/her alone. Get over your quirky insecurities and your impulsive desire to force your views and your will on someone else who may not choose to see the world the way you do. That's not liberty. That's not right. Live and let live. Go your own way in peace. Deal with your personal inner conflicts and limitations yourself. Don't make them into someone else's misery because of your own insecurity, intolerance or your inability to accept others as they are.",

A similar number believed that it was all right for a man to slap his wife or girlfriend if she is \u201cnagging or constantly moaning at him\u201d. The findings of the poll, conducted for the Home Office, also disclosed about a quarter of people believe that wearing sexy or revealing clothing should lead to a woman being held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted. Although a majority of 1,065 people over 18 questioned last month believe that it is never acceptable to hit or slap a woman, the poll found that those aged 25-39 were more likely to consider that there were circumstances in which it was acceptable to hit or slap a woman. Men and women over 65 and those in the lower social class groups D and E are more likely to believe that woman should be held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted, Ipsos Mori telephone poll found. Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d Ms Smith said that more needed to be done to challenge attitudes that condoned violence against women and girls. She was speaking as she launched a police lead review of whether new laws are needed to tackle serial domestic violence abuses and whether there is a link between the early sexualisation of young girls and violent abuse. One idea being considered is to allow women to ask police if a new partner has a record of domestic violence. A pilot scheme that allows women to request information on whether a new partner has a history of child sex abuse is currently underway in four police force areas of England and Wales. But Ms Smith was confronted at a working breakfast at which she launched the campaign by a veteran domestic violence campaigner. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, accused Ms Smith over breakfast at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster of using \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cspin\u201d. She said that government action so far had been \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and condemned plans for a database of serial domestic abusers. Ms Horley said: \u201cWe have had enough talking \u2013 we need action. As for the perpetrators\u2019 register, it is a gimmick and doesn\u2019t address the root problem. \u201cThe majority of violent men don\u2019t come to the attention of police and it won\u2019t keep women safe. \u201cPolice can\u2019t be expected to monitor relationships and love lives of offenders.\u201d She went on: \u201dThe Government is hoping to get away with useless initiatives like this register and it is hypocritical to sound tough and do little.\u201d She said that the cases of Sabina Akhtar and Katie Summers showed that not enough was being done. Ms Smith tried to interrupt the tirade but was shouted down before Vera Baird, the solicitor general, stepped in to argue the Government\u2019s case. \"It is the weak who are cruel.

A similar number believed that it was all right for a man to slap his wife or girlfriend if she is \u201cnagging or constantly moaning at him\u201d. The findings of the poll, conducted for the Home Office, also disclosed about a quarter of people believe that wearing sexy or revealing clothing should lead to a woman being held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted. Although a majority of 1,065 people over 18 questioned last month believe that it is never acceptable to hit or slap a woman, the poll found that those aged 25-39 were more likely to consider that there were circumstances in which it was acceptable to hit or slap a woman. Men and women over 65 and those in the lower social class groups D and E are more likely to believe that woman should be held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted, Ipsos Mori telephone poll found. Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said: \u201cViolence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d Ms Smith said that more needed to be done to challenge attitudes that condoned violence against women and girls. She was speaking as she launched a police lead review of whether new laws are needed to tackle serial domestic violence abuses and whether there is a link between the early sexualisation of young girls and violent abuse. One idea being considered is to allow women to ask police if a new partner has a record of domestic violence. A pilot scheme that allows women to request information on whether a new partner has a history of child sex abuse is currently underway in four police force areas of England and Wales. But Ms Smith was confronted at a working breakfast at which she launched the campaign by a veteran domestic violence campaigner. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, accused Ms Smith over breakfast at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster of using \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cspin\u201d. She said that government action so far had been \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and condemned plans for a database of serial domestic abusers. Ms Horley said: \u201cWe have had enough talking \u2013 we need action. As for the perpetrators\u2019 register, it is a gimmick and doesn\u2019t address the root problem. \u201cThe majority of violent men don\u2019t come to the attention of police and it won\u2019t keep women safe. \u201cPolice can\u2019t be expected to monitor relationships and love lives of offenders.\u201d She went on: \u201dThe Government is hoping to get away with useless initiatives like this register and it is hypocritical to sound tough and do little.\u201d She said that the cases of Sabina Akhtar and Katie Summers showed that not enough was being done. Ms Smith tried to interrupt the tirade but was shouted down before Vera Baird, the solicitor general, stepped in to argue the Government\u2019s case. \"It is the weak who are cruel.

Self protection is the same way: protect yourself, while you extricate yourself from the situation, but, leave her azz! It takes a truely amoral whimp, to beat on some one smaller, weeker, less dignified- REGARDLESS of race/creed/color/sex. And, NO, I do mean to imply that anyone other than myself, is always weeker, smaller, or less diginified. It's just that some of those charachteristics are always present, when a man goes to the physical domination/stop-thinking mode! (No, I'm no saint....)",

The \"blame\" falls on both sides, but it is never clearly black-and-white, easily differentiated or simple. That someone should be oppressed, harrassed or deprived of their liberties or happiness because others take offense or CHOOSE to be 'offended', as in the female Southwest passenger, is a sign that there are serious inhibitions and mental issues to be dealt with.

Leave him/her alone. Get over your quirky insecurities and your impulsive desire to force your views and your will on someone else who may not choose to see the world the way you do. That's not liberty. That's not right. Live and let live. Go your own way in peace. Deal with your personal inner conflicts and limitations yourself. Don't make them into someone else's misery because of your own insecurity, intolerance or your inability to accept others as they are.",
