This nation was designed to serve the will of the people. Thats why we have elections and send individuals to washington carry the message, But they just dont and once elected ignore their constituents knowing theres not a dammed thing they can do about it till next election and by then the damage is done and people have short memories. Well maybe there is something that can be done? In our age of technology theres no Apparent reason why each vote couldnt be recorded on a non tamperable referendum sheet showing the will of the people and the promises made by the candidates. And once elected they must abide by thoes promises made with no authority to deviate unless they go back to the people for authorization. Or just program the issues into an automated Robot that they can take along with them for voting puposes. Aint no greed or deals built into a machine. Sounds far out but how else can you eliminate the human factor with greed, deception, and corruption? Perhaps Bill Gates should be working on an infallible Lie detector and if you fail you go to jail?",
