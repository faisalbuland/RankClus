Altman, that just launched on this latest mission had an interesting experience with Hollywood some years back. The story told of how he had just returned from a seven month deployment...he was an F-14 Tomcat pilot, when he was told by his command to help fly some scenes for a movie in the making. The movie.....\"Top Gun\" and he flew the scenes as Tom Cruise's \"Maverick\", including the \"Mig Assault\" when the F-14 went inverted to flip the bird to the Mig pilot. In the interview, he laughed off the Hollyweird crap saying that any real military pilot who pulled that or the buzzing of the tower would certainly loose his/her wings. The story said that he wasn't able to see the opening of \"Top Gun\" as he was already back out on another seven month deployment....flying those F-14's. Don From his NASA Biography: jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/altman.html EXPERIENCE: Commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy in August 1981, received his Navy wings of gold in February 1983. Attached to Fighter Squadron 51 at NAS Miramar, Altman completed two deployments to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean flying the F-14A Tomcat. In August 1987, he was selected for the Naval Postgraduate School-Test Pilot School Coop program and graduated with Test Pilot School Class 97 in June 1990 as a Distinguished Graduate, spending the next two years as a test pilot on various F-14 projects. Deploying withVF-31 and the new F-14D, he was awarded the Navy Air Medal for his role as a strike leader flying over Southern Iraq in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. Shortly following his return from this six-month deployment, he was selected for the astronaut program. He has logged over 5000 flight hours in more than 40 types of aircraft.",

I still remember that so vividly. The word was going around town that Hollywood was coming to Miramar, where I was stationed, and they were going to do a movie, and we were all kind of excited. My squadron had just gotten back from a seven-and-a-half month cruise about a week-and-a-half before, so our airplanes were at home, we were available, we weren't too highly tasked. And it turned out they picked my squadron to supply the F-14s. Then the skipper got together and tried to pick four guys that he thought, were mature enough, I guess, to handle, you know, the capability that they were being given in working with the movie, and all the things that were required. And the director wanted to have a small cadre of people that he could work with so you develop an understanding of what the movie folks want versus what we can do and how to try and balance those two requirements. The flying was incredible. You know, most Navy pilots don't get to buzz the tower like in the movie - if you did you could just peel your wings off and, throw 'em at the door because you probably wouldn't be flying anymore - but, since it was Hollywood, you know, they wanted the scene. I had to buzz the tower. And, of course, they wanted nine different takes - so we did it nine times!\" en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Altman",
