The Sikh Coalition is taking on the cause of two commissioned officers who are now in their last year of medical and dental school and slated to enter the Army's Officers' Leadership Basic Course in July. Capt. Kamaljeet S. Kalsi and 2nd Lt. Tejdeep S. Rattan, the organization says, were told by recruiters they would be able to serve with their articles of faith -- the turban and uncut hair requirements of male Sikhs. Since the men accepted their commissions, the group says, they have continued to maintain their articles of faith throughout their schooling. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher C. Garver told Military.com today that he could not comment on claims by the officers that recruiters told them they could serve wearing turbans and beards. He said that is something that would come up among the officers and their chain of command once they move from Reserve status to active duty.

I knew pilots that had beards and mustaches and they had to keep the beards and \"staches\" trimmed so as to permit an \"air tight\" fit on their oxygen masks... The same with DC party members, couldn't interfere with the fit of an OBA... What's the problem?... Much ado about nothing, it would seem... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

I was told that, in World War 2, Indian troops wore a steel skull cap under their turbans. I can't recall hearing that one but there's lot's of (possibly apocryphal) stories about turbans stopping bullets from both wars and there's verifiable accounts of them stopping shrapnel including an RAF pilot who landed his Hurricane to discover a large chunk of Me 109 shell casing sticking out of the side of his head. I really think that I should point out that the turban itself is not an absolute requirement for orthodox Sikhs but uncut hair is and is Kesh one of the \"Five Ks\" that all adult males are expected to retain. The others being Kanga the comb required to care for Kesh, Kara an iron bracelet, Kahera basically cotton shorts comfy for fighting in (and possibly the origin of the English slang kecks meaning underpants) and Kirpan a shortsword or dagger (often vestigial in polite company). The above are as much a part of being Sikh as halal food is for Muslims or eating Kosher and chopping the end off one's wotsit is for Jews or having the right to proselytise tediously and irritatingly is to certain types of Christian sects (why can't they take, \"No I don't want a copy of bloody Watchtower and if you don't sod off now my black pudding will be burnt,\" for an answer?). Obviously there is a get out clause and like halal, kosher and working on Saturday (never stopped the IDF has it?) a Sikh may shave in the very, very direst emergencies - they did early on in the trenches before gas masks were adapted - but only when there's no other reasonable option (the last human Guru of the Sikhs was pretty clear on this). As there is a reasonable option, at least for training purposes and probably for most deployments (if they can pass the CS test who cares?) I cannot see why the US can't adopt to Sikh dress requirements as readily as it does to Jewish and Muslim dietary requirements or the foibles of vegetarians. In fact compared with some religious requirements they're fairly low maintenance and the turban looks at least as smart as those ridiculous berets you've adopted. (It's been conveyed to me by a Sikh mate that the turban itself may be swapped for some other means of covering the hair tidily if necessary (such as when fitting it under a helmet) but the turban is such a practical garment most don't bother. Examples are head scarves or bandanna type things as worn by the Monty Pannesar a Sikh who plays cricket for England.) Edit: By the way it has been alleged (in another place) that the practice of kesh marks Sikhs as unhygienic along with Muslims and Hindus. In actual fact regular washing is an important part of all three of those religions and always has been. Amusingly of the major religions historically the one that has had the biggest problem with cleanliness has been Christianity, with the churches occasionally preaching against too much of an interest in bathing on the grounds that it encouraged carnality. The Templars even went so far as to have rules forbidding not just bathing but also changing one's undergarments (and they wore sheepskin pants). The buggers must have stunk.",

First off, American Indians didnt wear Face Paint on a daily basis, But if you get your info from watching westerns on TV thats what you'll think. Secondly, I have seen Jewish Soldiers in Uniform wearing Yamulkes and most of the time you wouldnt even know it as it fits under their Headgear. There is even an ACU pattern one for Rabbi's with an NSN and everything. There is a Orthodox Rabbi who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, GITMO & the First Gulf war, Grenada & in Bosnia who wears a snow white beard.

I was told that, in World War 2, Indian troops wore a steel skull cap under their turbans. I can't recall hearing that one but there's lot's of (possibly apocryphal) stories about turbans stopping bullets from both wars and there's verifiable accounts of them stopping shrapnel including an RAF pilot who landed his Hurricane to discover a large chunk of Me 109 shell casing sticking out of the side of his head. I really think that I should point out that the turban itself is not an absolute requirement for orthodox Sikhs but uncut hair is and is Kesh one of the \"Five Ks\" that all adult males are expected to retain. The others being Kanga the comb required to care for Kesh, Kara an iron bracelet, Kahera basically cotton shorts comfy for fighting in (and possibly the origin of the English slang kecks meaning underpants) and Kirpan a shortsword or dagger (often vestigial in polite company). The above are as much a part of being Sikh as halal food is for Muslims or eating Kosher and chopping the end off one's wotsit is for Jews or having the right to proselytise tediously and irritatingly is to certain types of Christian sects (why can't they take, \"No I don't want a copy of bloody Watchtower and if you don't sod off now my black pudding will be burnt,\" for an answer?). Obviously there is a get out clause and like halal, kosher and working on Saturday (never stopped the IDF has it?) a Sikh may shave in the very, very direst emergencies - they did early on in the trenches before gas masks were adapted - but only when there's no other reasonable option (the last human Guru of the Sikhs was pretty clear on this). As there is a reasonable option, at least for training purposes and probably for most deployments (if they can pass the CS test who cares?) I cannot see why the US can't adopt to Sikh dress requirements as readily as it does to Jewish and Muslim dietary requirements or the foibles of vegetarians. In fact compared with some religious requirements they're fairly low maintenance and the turban looks at least as smart as those ridiculous berets you've adopted. (It's been conveyed to me by a Sikh mate that the turban itself may be swapped for some other means of covering the hair tidily if necessary (such as when fitting it under a helmet) but the turban is such a practical garment most don't bother. Examples are head scarves or bandanna type things as worn by the Monty Pannesar a Sikh who plays cricket for England.) Edit: By the way it has been alleged (in another place) that the practice of kesh marks Sikhs as unhygienic along with Muslims and Hindus. In actual fact regular washing is an important part of all three of those religions and always has been. Amusingly of the major religions historically the one that has had the biggest problem with cleanliness has been Christianity, with the churches occasionally preaching against too much of an interest in bathing on the grounds that it encouraged carnality. The Templars even went so far as to have rules forbidding not just bathing but also changing one's undergarments (and they wore sheepskin pants). The buggers must have stunk.",
