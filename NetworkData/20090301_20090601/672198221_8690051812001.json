She is a child of divorce and it's been very weird seeing the way each side has reacted. Our biggest regret is that her Grand father had passed prior to the decision to join. He was a highly decorated veteran (a flying tiger) and regrettably wouldn't talk about it with us when he was still living. I have found it that a lot of families don't speak of their time in the service. I am curious if Geoff has heard stories that family members haven't. For example he has waited this long to speak to his own father.",

In fact, a video interview posted on the internet is how I found a living WWII soldier back in January. I have since established a dialog with his grand-nephew to let him know I honor his bravery. A year ago, I knew nothing really of the sacrifices of a soldier. Then, in April, I found a trunk full of letters in my great aunt's garage (over 400). These were written to and from her husband who was a 1st Lt. in the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion and who died in the Battle of the Bulge in 1945. I try to imagine myself sleep starved and hungry, jumping out of airplanes with explosives and marching head-on into machine guns in the frozen forest. My great uncle did all of this and somehow remained a hopeless romantic, describing in great detail the home they would one day share overlooking the bay. How lucky I am to have a home and share it with my husband! Reading the letters led to watching films on the subject, then reading books... searching the internet... and finding people who were actually there. I love how today's technology can help us learn stories untold, share pictures unseen. An aspiring writer, I am compelled to pen some of their story for future generations. I feel it is our responsibility to preserve the many facets of a given history. Nobody wants to glorify war, but I hope we all continue to glorify our freedoms and the remarkable courage of a soldier. Thanks Geoff. My husband and I will have to get the new album. We grew up on your songs. They are a shining part of our history. Jennifer Minshall",

The general manager comes up with some random dollar figure, I forget what it was..and adds a time limit..if the listeners dont pony up the money by a certain time...no deal. Well about five minutes before the deadline the DJ is about $1000 short of whatever the figure is..so she calls Tate. Tate is clearly a little confused as to what is going on..after a few times of explaining the situation all Tate can understand is that this DJ he does not know wants a 1000 bucks for some charity to play his album.

Furthermore, military service is in no way, shape or form any more \"honorable\" than any other occupation.

Find something else to do for a living that is fun, satisfying and creative, and which doesn't require you to potentially lose life or limb while taking part in what is essentially a series of large-scale bar fights.

In closing, if my words offend anyone in the U.S. military, please remember that I am saying them because I care about you, and don't want you to waste your life serving those who couldn't care less about you or your families.

This is one worth mentioning. \"Our military men and women make sacrifices, and I for one never stopped to realize just how enormous these sacrifices are. I took it all for granted.\" This whole country takes for granted the service of others. Too many think those \"who have served\" are either stupid or couldn't get a job. As many of us Vets have stated before the problem with our do nothing or anti military Reps in congress is because they do not have military experience. That experience would allow them to better understand the military or understand our position in the world structure. This is not to say that \"non-servers\" are dumb but without that experience they must ask others what the military is all about. Consider this for a moment. If the son of a WWII vet did not serve in any service from about 1960 thru 1980 was it because they tried not to or did not care enough about the US of A to serve? The same follows with the offspring of Vets of Korea, Nam etc. Did they think they were \"too good\" to serve or did not care? I don't know the reason but if more citizens of this great country \"signed on the dotted line and took the pledge\" maybe we would not have the hatred toward those who keep us free that is in congress and many state houses. My family served and sacrificed many. There were forty-eight (48) in WWII. The New Mexico National Guard, which included many members of our family, was activated (as was many other state's units) and sent to the Philippines. As a result we lost members there and on the Bataan Death March, Camp O'Donnell and other Japanese POW camps. We lost two on hell ships sunk by allied forces and have six MIA's in the Pacific and one in the ETO. My own Father was in the ETO and survived. In addition I have too many (9) cousins on the Nam wall. As our family\u2019s genealogist I have researched our military involvement since our arrival in this great land in 1598 with the Conquistadors. The family has and will continue to do our part. I am glad this rock and roller has seen the light but if he had served he could have spoken to his father as one Vet to another. I know my brother and I did with our father. My son has passed but I look forward to having the same conversation with my grandchildren, God willing.",

In closing, if my words offend anyone in the U.S. military, please remember that I am saying them because I care about you, and don't want you to waste your life serving those who couldn't care less about you or your families. And finally, remember that when you joined the military, you took an oath to defend the Constitution, whose first amendment guarantees freedom of speech for EVERYONE -- not just those with whom you agree.

I have never been told that nor have I even thought it. I was under the impression that we went into Iraq to secure our right to live. When people state that we (the Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine) fight for our freedoms, they include much more than the freedom of speech. Now, I don't want to get the left wing loonies started with their \"Bush lied\" BS (which is exactly what it is - total BS), but we went into Iraq to secure us against the threat of future attacks. You can argue whether that was right or wrong, and I suspect people will be arguing that for generations to come. The point is, at the time we invaded Iraq, there was substantial intelligence to suggest they were a credible, serious, and imminent threat against us. Much of that intelligence has not panned out but it was credible enough at the time to garner overwhelming support. Again, the Iraq war will be used extensively in the debate on whether or not we should conduct pre-emptive attacks, but at the time most thought it necessary. In addition, Iraq was constantly violating a treaty from a previous war, the Gulf War, which, IMO, was justification in itself to remove the regime. Amazingly enough, the Gulf War was also not about free speech. The Gulf War was about freeing a country that was hostilely taken over by Iraq. No one ever suggested that war had anything to do with our freedoms. It had to do with protecting the little guy (of course, we also had significant oil interests in the region). Come to think about it, did anyone ever claim that WWI or WWII were about free speech? Maybe indirectly because if we were taken over by a ruthless dictator, we would certainly lose our free speech, but I think we would have lost many more freedoms than that. You will hear many on this board state that the sacrifices of the military is one of the main reasons why we all have the freedom of speech to say some of the hateful things that people say, but we provide much more than that. We fight to protect all our freedoms the most basic of which are the right to LIFE, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. SCOUTS OUT!",

My wife is a newly commissioned Ensign and through out the last year have come to realize a lot of the same things Geoff mentioned in his column. We have turned into a patriotic family. You become perceived in a certain way when you are. I am very proud of her and it's been interesting and eye opening as to what others feel about the military. She is a child of divorce and it's been very weird seeing the way each side has reacted. Our biggest regret is that her Grand father had passed prior to the decision to join. He was a highly decorated veteran (a flying tiger) and regrettably wouldn't talk about it with us when he was still living. I have found it that a lot of families don't speak of their time in the service. I am curious if Geoff has heard stories that family members haven't. For example he has waited this long to speak to his own father.",

I am a longtime fan of queensryche and can relate to this subject very much of recent time. My wife is a newly commissioned Ensign and through out the last year have come to realize a lot of the same things Geoff mentioned in his column. We have turned into a patriotic family. You become perceived in a certain way when you are. I am very proud of her and it's been interesting and eye opening as to what others feel about the military. She is a child of divorce and it's been very weird seeing the way each side has reacted. Our biggest regret is that her Grand father had passed prior to the decision to join. He was a highly decorated veteran (a flying tiger) and regrettably wouldn't talk about it with us when he was still living. I have found it that a lot of families don't speak of their time in the service. I am curious if Geoff has heard stories that family members haven't. For example he has waited this long to speak to his own father.",

In fact, a video interview posted on the internet is how I found a living WWII soldier back in January. I have since established a dialog with his grand-nephew to let him know I honor his bravery. A year ago, I knew nothing really of the sacrifices of a soldier. Then, in April, I found a trunk full of letters in my great aunt's garage (over 400). These were written to and from her husband who was a 1st Lt. in the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion and who died in the Battle of the Bulge in 1945. I try to imagine myself sleep starved and hungry, jumping out of airplanes with explosives and marching head-on into machine guns in the frozen forest. My great uncle did all of this and somehow remained a hopeless romantic, describing in great detail the home they would one day share overlooking the bay. How lucky I am to have a home and share it with my husband! Reading the letters led to watching films on the subject, then reading books... searching the internet... and finding people who were actually there. I love how today's technology can help us learn stories untold, share pictures unseen. An aspiring writer, I am compelled to pen some of their story for future generations. I feel it is our responsibility to preserve the many facets of a given history. Nobody wants to glorify war, but I hope we all continue to glorify our freedoms and the remarkable courage of a soldier. Thanks Geoff. My husband and I will have to get the new album. We grew up on your songs. They are a shining part of our history. Jennifer Minshall",

Tate is clearly a little confused as to what is going on..after a few times of explaining the situation all Tate can understand is that this DJ he does not know wants a 1000 bucks for some charity to play his album.

I took it all for granted.\" This whole country takes for granted the service of others. Too many think those \"who have served\" are either stupid or couldn't get a job. As many of us Vets have stated before the problem with our do nothing or anti military Reps in congress is because they do not have military experience. That experience would allow them to better understand the military or understand our position in the world structure. This is not to say that \"non-servers\" are dumb but without that experience they must ask others what the military is all about. Consider this for a moment. If the son of a WWII vet did not serve in any service from about 1960 thru 1980 was it because they tried not to or did not care enough about the US of A to serve? The same follows with the offspring of Vets of Korea, Nam etc. Did they think they were \"too good\" to serve or did not care? I don't know the reason but if more citizens of this great country \"signed on the dotted line and took the pledge\" maybe we would not have the hatred toward those who keep us free that is in congress and many state houses. My family served and sacrificed many. There were forty-eight (48) in WWII. The New Mexico National Guard, which included many members of our family, was activated (as was many other state's units) and sent to the Philippines. As a result we lost members there and on the Bataan Death March, Camp O'Donnell and other Japanese POW camps. We lost two on hell ships sunk by allied forces and have six MIA's in the Pacific and one in the ETO. My own Father was in the ETO and survived. In addition I have too many (9) cousins on the Nam wall. As our family\u2019s genealogist I have researched our military involvement since our arrival in this great land in 1598 with the Conquistadors. The family has and will continue to do our part. I am glad this rock and roller has seen the light but if he had served he could have spoken to his father as one Vet to another. I know my brother and I did with our father. My son has passed but I look forward to having the same conversation with my grandchildren, God willing.",

I have never been told that nor have I even thought it. I was under the impression that we went into Iraq to secure our right to live. When people state that we (the Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine) fight for our freedoms, they include much more than the freedom of speech. Now, I don't want to get the left wing loonies started with their \"Bush lied\" BS (which is exactly what it is - total BS), but we went into Iraq to secure us against the threat of future attacks. You can argue whether that was right or wrong, and I suspect people will be arguing that for generations to come. The point is, at the time we invaded Iraq, there was substantial intelligence to suggest they were a credible, serious, and imminent threat against us. Much of that intelligence has not panned out but it was credible enough at the time to garner overwhelming support. Again, the Iraq war will be used extensively in the debate on whether or not we should conduct pre-emptive attacks, but at the time most thought it necessary. In addition, Iraq was constantly violating a treaty from a previous war, the Gulf War, which, IMO, was justification in itself to remove the regime. Amazingly enough, the Gulf War was also not about free speech. The Gulf War was about freeing a country that was hostilely taken over by Iraq. No one ever suggested that war had anything to do with our freedoms. It had to do with protecting the little guy (of course, we also had significant oil interests in the region). Come to think about it, did anyone ever claim that WWI or WWII were about free speech? Maybe indirectly because if we were taken over by a ruthless dictator, we would certainly lose our free speech, but I think we would have lost many more freedoms than that. You will hear many on this board state that the sacrifices of the military is one of the main reasons why we all have the freedom of speech to say some of the hateful things that people say, but we provide much more than that. We fight to protect all our freedoms the most basic of which are the right to LIFE, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. SCOUTS OUT!",
