Simple answer - yes, because it is technically not an explosive round or a kinetic round, but a round filled with chemicals whose primary purpose is to create white smoke, as a screen or marker. If used for those two purposed, it has a legitimate purpose. If someone calls for a \"fire for effect\" with an HE and WP mix to blow up and burn out the enemy, some feel that should be a no-no. Same with dropping napalm, which is basically jelled gasoline. We carried 4 or 5 rounds of WP on our tanks for \"marking\" purposes, and were told not to use it against \"troops in open.\" I guess that's the way it goes in \"nice\" wars, if there is such a thing. I noticed the Israelis were using WP \"for screening purposes\" in their last fight recently - - Gaza WP Air Bursts - Kosher??? You got me - - Wandering and Wondering",
