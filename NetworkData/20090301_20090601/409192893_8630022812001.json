Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., as part of his 17-city, cross-country tour called United Families, which he says is intended to put a human face on the immigration debate. Uh Hmm,Illegal Alien Debate \"We think that families are the cornerstone of our society and our nation, and an immigration system should preserve those families, not destroy them,\" Gutierrez told FOX News Capitol Hill Producer Chad Pergram on Tuesday. The congressman is collecting petitions that ask President Obama to \"stop the immigration raids and deportations that are tearing our marriages, families and children apart.\" He is expected to present those petitions when Hispanic members of Congress meet with the President Wednesday. Leave with the deportee On Saturday night, Pelosi joined Gutierrez before a cheering crowd at St. Anthony's chanting, \"Si se puede,\" or \"Yes we can.\" Referring to work site enforcement actions by ICE agents, Pelosi said, \"We have to have a change in policy and practice and again ... I can't say enough, the raids must end. The raids must end. \"You are special people. You're here on a Saturday night to take responsibility for our country's future. That makes you very, very patriotic.\" Special people, wtf lady, how bout the ones that try to come here legally! \"I was embarrassed by what she said,\" said Rick Oltman, with Californians for Population Stabilization, an anti-illegal immigrant group. \"Exhorting illegal aliens for taking responsibility for our country's future.... In fact, sitting there in the audience.... I really resented that comment.\" \"I think it was pandering to the crowd but also insulting to American citizens who consider themselves to be patriotic, who obey the rule of law,\" said Oltman, who shot a video of the rally.",
