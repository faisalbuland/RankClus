About 100 people were evacuated, and 49 were taken to area hospitals, but officials said their injuries did not appear to be life-threatening. The 24-year-old operator of the moving trolley, who was the most seriously injured, admitted to police that he was sending text messages from his cell phone when the accident occurred, State Transportation Secretary James Aloisi Jr., chairman of the MBTA Board of Directors, said accidents like Friday's have become too common, citing a train accident last year in California in which 25 people were killed. A conductor involved in that crash was found to have sent and received 43 text messages cell phone use should be totally banned when behind the wheel. I have even been forced off the highway by a tractor trailer driver on to the meadian due to him talking on a cell phone. I have seen drivers going headon at traffic in the wrong laane using their cell phone, I say Ban them completely while driving, Use the phone at home or pull over and stop when making or recieving calls.",

There is room to talk on the phone while doing things IF it is hands free, but texting deflects all attention to the phone to enter a message or reply. La. has a law that one must either pull over or use a hands free phone while driving. I just wish they were more strict about it. I do think they may be very strict if someone is caught texting while driving.",
