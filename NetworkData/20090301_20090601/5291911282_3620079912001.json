I just saw in the local paper(one of those weekly newspapers), that Fox television is going to shoot a new series, 'Lights Out'(don't know what it is about), in the town next to me(Alpine). The location is next to an old clock tower. This tower was built by sugar mogul Manuel Rionda for his wife. She wanted to be able to look across the Hudson at New York. Legend has it that she was up in the tower, only to look out & see her husband with another woman. Distraught, she threw herself off the tower, commiting suicide. Her ghost is reputed to haunt the tower. It is said that if someone drives backwards around the tower three times her ghost will appear. Also, if you were to walk backwards around the tower 6 times the devil will appear. Thus, it is known as The Devil's Tower. So what weird, spooky legends do you guys have around your neck of the woods? PS, no de-bunkers please, I prefer that legends be kept as legends & not explained away.",

        "content": "In the little town where I tried to grow up ( ), there was a two-story home near the middle of town that was of mansion proportions. In fact, if you wish to picture it in your mind, think of the Addams Family house, or the house on the hill behind the Bates Motel in the original Psycho... The house sat in the middle of a couple of acres, surrounded by a six foot high wrought iron fence with tall brick corner and gate posts. The yard inside was a clutter of unmowed lawns huge over-grown bushes, and very tall, mostly dead trees - probably elms and black walnuts. The whole place had that abandoned, run-down look. Of course, to all us little kids, it was \"The Haunted House.\" All you had to do was say that phrase, and EVERYBODY knew exactly which house you meant, though there were other abandoned homes throughout the town... Now the thing that made this structure particularly frightening was the rumor that kids had seen a ghost, in the shape of an old lady, around the place towards evening as the sun went down. When I got old enough to go to 6th grade in the ole Junior High in the center of town, I had to walk past the cemetery and that place to get to school and go home. Well, one evening after school in September, as I was walking home, I got up the courage to look at the ole Haunted House as I walked by, and there in a upstairs window was someone watching me, an old lady!! - barely visible through the dirty pane!! Man! I lit out of there like a scalded dog! YIPE!! For several weeks, I took a longer out-of-the-way route that took me down around by Mystical's farm so I could stay away from the ole Haunted House, but as it got closer to Halloween, and became darker sooner in the evening (No Daylight Savings Time), I finally decided to start going home the straighter route, past the Haunted House - I just wouldn't look!!! Besides, it was probably just a figment of my imagination. I tried to hook up with kids headed that way, and stay with them as far as possible, but usually they would thin out by the time we reached the cemetery. Actually, that didn't bother me too much, because we played football in there on the weekends in the north end that didn't have many headstones yet (OUCH!) - - Well, right before Halloween, I found myself walking home alone again one evening, but I had finally convinced myself that the image was nothing more than my over-creative imagination - no sweat!! So I began walking past this run-down, over-grown, eerie place with as much bravado as I could muster, forcing myself to keep a casual slow pace. As I reached the midpoint near the massive gates, I decided I would stop and look again, which I did. As I surveyed the old house, I looked at each dirt-covered window. I could see the hints of old curtains behind some of them, but there were no images other than that. I kind of smiled to myself as having conquered my fears, then as my gaze went to an area among the trunks of the massive dead and dying trees, there was an old shriveled lady all dressed in grey walking towards the house!! She paused, looked in my direction, then continued on!!! Again, like a scared jackrabbit, I bolted on the dead run the whole mile to home!! I never told anyone what I had seen, but I avoided that place like the plague. Even as I went on into High School and became old enough to drive, I didn't like driving past there. Then my senior year, as I was looking through the town's paper for articles about the football game I'd played in the week before, there was a picture of The Haunted House! And next to it was a picture of the woman I had seen in the window and the garden.... She had died at nearly the age of 100. She had lived alone all those years, buying a little food and necessities from the little IGA store around the corner, and - I guess - just waiting to die. I felt so rotten. All us kids thought the place was abandoned. We didn't know someone really was in there. Why the good people of this town didn't help her care for her yard and befriend her, I'll never know - because the town was full of very good people...but it shouldn't have been that way... Thus is the Legend of the Haunted House of . . Pleasant Grove... Wandering and Wondering",

The roads around the area at the time (Beaver Dam, Fletcherstown) were rather isolated and eerie and had a halloween atmosphere about them. The USDA center has/had a lot of old buildings on its property and I swear some of them came right out of a 1950s creature feature. I half expected to see some giant spider crawling around. Most of the roads in the area have been widened and have developments along them. Oh well, progress..... We also have Cry Baby Bridge close by in Bowie.

Newton Alabama: On December 3, 1864, the Reverend Bill Sketoe, was unjustly hanged near the banks of the Choctawhatchee River in Newton, Alabama. Sketoe was the pastor of the local Methodist church. When the Civil War began, he decided to join the Confederate Army. After a few years of fighting for the Confederacy, his wife became gravely ill. Upon hearing this news, he hired a substitute to take his place on the battlefield and headed back to Newton to be with his wife. After spending some time back at home, a local group of men, who put themselves in charge of punishing deserters, became suspicious that he was a traitor. One day, the men decided to punish Sketoe. The men ambushed him and tied a noose around his neck. With his hands and feet bound, the men beat him. Sketoe was placed into a buggy and positioned below a tree. The rope was thrown over a branch and secured. One of the men whipped the horse attached to the buggy, leaving Sketoe dangling from the branch. The hanging, however, did not go quite as planned. The branch of the oak tree bent from Sketoe\u2019s weight and his toes touched the ground. Upon realizing he could breathe, one of the men, who was a cripple, used his crutch to dig out a hole beneath Sketoe\u2019s feet. This allowed the noose to tighten, ending the life of Bill Sketoe. It is believed that he haunted the 6 men who all had violent deaths. For a number of years, the townspeople realized that the hole would not stay filled. Even if they put enough dirt and brush so that there was a small mound, the hole would be dug back out by the next morning. It is believed that the ghost of Bill Sketoe keeps the hole cleaned out. At one point, two workers who were working on a bridge over the Choctawhatchee River decided to camp beneath the tree that Sketoe was hanged from. Knowing the story of the hole, they filled it up prior to setting up their tent.

The location is next to an old clock tower. This tower was built by sugar mogul Manuel Rionda for his wife. She wanted to be able to look across the Hudson at New York. Legend has it that she was up in the tower, only to look out & see her husband with another woman. Distraught, she threw herself off the tower, commiting suicide. Her ghost is reputed to haunt the tower. It is said that if someone drives backwards around the tower three times her ghost will appear. Also, if you were to walk backwards around the tower 6 times the devil will appear. Thus, it is known as The Devil's Tower. So what weird, spooky legends do you guys have around your neck of the woods? PS, no de-bunkers please, I prefer that legends be kept as legends & not explained away.",

In fact, if you wish to picture it in your mind, think of the Addams Family house, or the house on the hill behind the Bates Motel in the original Psycho... The house sat in the middle of a couple of acres, surrounded by a six foot high wrought iron fence with tall brick corner and gate posts. The yard inside was a clutter of unmowed lawns huge over-grown bushes, and very tall, mostly dead trees - probably elms and black walnuts. The whole place had that abandoned, run-down look. Of course, to all us little kids, it was \"The Haunted House.\" All you had to do was say that phrase, and EVERYBODY knew exactly which house you meant, though there were other abandoned homes throughout the town... Now the thing that made this structure particularly frightening was the rumor that kids had seen a ghost, in the shape of an old lady, around the place towards evening as the sun went down. When I got old enough to go to 6th grade in the ole Junior High in the center of town, I had to walk past the cemetery and that place to get to school and go home. Well, one evening after school in September, as I was walking home, I got up the courage to look at the ole Haunted House as I walked by, and there in a upstairs window was someone watching me, an old lady!! - barely visible through the dirty pane!! Man! I lit out of there like a scalded dog! YIPE!! For several weeks, I took a longer out-of-the-way route that took me down around by Mystical's farm so I could stay away from the ole Haunted House, but as it got closer to Halloween, and became darker sooner in the evening (No Daylight Savings Time), I finally decided to start going home the straighter route, past the Haunted House - I just wouldn't look!!! Besides, it was probably just a figment of my imagination. I tried to hook up with kids headed that way, and stay with them as far as possible, but usually they would thin out by the time we reached the cemetery. Actually, that didn't bother me too much, because we played football in there on the weekends in the north end that didn't have many headstones yet (OUCH!) - - Well, right before Halloween, I found myself walking home alone again one evening, but I had finally convinced myself that the image was nothing more than my over-creative imagination - no sweat!! So I began walking past this run-down, over-grown, eerie place with as much bravado as I could muster, forcing myself to keep a casual slow pace. As I reached the midpoint near the massive gates, I decided I would stop and look again, which I did. As I surveyed the old house, I looked at each dirt-covered window. I could see the hints of old curtains behind some of them, but there were no images other than that. I kind of smiled to myself as having conquered my fears, then as my gaze went to an area among the trunks of the massive dead and dying trees, there was an old shriveled lady all dressed in grey walking towards the house!! She paused, looked in my direction, then continued on!!! Again, like a scared jackrabbit, I bolted on the dead run the whole mile to home!! I never told anyone what I had seen, but I avoided that place like the plague. Even as I went on into High School and became old enough to drive, I didn't like driving past there. Then my senior year, as I was looking through the town's paper for articles about the football game I'd played in the week before, there was a picture of The Haunted House! And next to it was a picture of the woman I had seen in the window and the garden.... She had died at nearly the age of 100. She had lived alone all those years, buying a little food and necessities from the little IGA store around the corner, and - I guess - just waiting to die. I felt so rotten. All us kids thought the place was abandoned. We didn't know someone really was in there. Why the good people of this town didn't help her care for her yard and befriend her, I'll never know - because the town was full of very good people...but it shouldn't have been that way...

Legend grew because of the USDA research center in Beltsville and a mysterious hospital in Glen Dale. Legend has it he was an escape mental patient that was used for experiments at both locations. The roads around the area at the time (Beaver Dam, Fletcherstown) were rather isolated and eerie and had a halloween atmosphere about them. The USDA center has/had a lot of old buildings on its property and I swear some of them came right out of a 1950s creature feature. I half expected to see some giant spider crawling around. Most of the roads in the area have been widened and have developments along them. Oh well, progress..... We also have Cry Baby Bridge close by in Bowie. That legend had a mother throwing her baby off the bridge and into the creek below and that if you wait long enough, you can hear the baby cry.",

Grandpa was said to have saved a drunken fisherman from drowning. The man had too many beers, he fell out of his boat, because he was so drunk, he could not swim. Grandpa, got hold of the mans shirt collar and hauled him to the shore of the lake. People standing on the shore wittnessed Grandpa's heroic deed, pulled the man the rest of the way out of the water and performed CPR, it is said that the man who Grandpa saved donated One Million Dollars to the preservation of Crane Lake and a lifetime supply of Salmon eggs for Grandpa to dine on. Grandpa saved a baby moose from drowning, the baby moose had wandered into the lake. He got out too far and soon he was in deep water and was drowning. Grandpa nudged the baby moose to shallow water where the babies mother pulled him out of the water. Fishermen no longer desire to catch Grandpa, but prefer to let him live out his life in comfort. It is estimated that Grandpa has sired over 500 Muskies in his lifetime! Keep smiling, everyone will wonder what you've been up to!",

Newton Alabama: On December 3, 1864, the Reverend Bill Sketoe, was unjustly hanged near the banks of the Choctawhatchee River in Newton, Alabama. Sketoe was the pastor of the local Methodist church. When the Civil War began, he decided to join the Confederate Army. After a few years of fighting for the Confederacy, his wife became gravely ill. Upon hearing this news, he hired a substitute to take his place on the battlefield and headed back to Newton to be with his wife. After spending some time back at home, a local group of men, who put themselves in charge of punishing deserters, became suspicious that he was a traitor. One day, the men decided to punish Sketoe. The men ambushed him and tied a noose around his neck. With his hands and feet bound, the men beat him. Sketoe was placed into a buggy and positioned below a tree. The rope was thrown over a branch and secured. One of the men whipped the horse attached to the buggy, leaving Sketoe dangling from the branch. The hanging, however, did not go quite as planned. The branch of the oak tree bent from Sketoe\u2019s weight and his toes touched the ground. Upon realizing he could breathe, one of the men, who was a cripple, used his crutch to dig out a hole beneath Sketoe\u2019s feet. This allowed the noose to tighten, ending the life of Bill Sketoe. It is believed that he haunted the 6 men who all had violent deaths. For a number of years, the townspeople realized that the hole would not stay filled. Even if they put enough dirt and brush so that there was a small mound, the hole would be dug back out by the next morning. It is believed that the ghost of Bill Sketoe keeps the hole cleaned out. At one point, two workers who were working on a bridge over the Choctawhatchee River decided to camp beneath the tree that Sketoe was hanged from. Knowing the story of the hole, they filled it up prior to setting up their tent. When the two men took down the tent the following morning, the hole had been dug up beneath them while they slept. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake.

Newton Alabama: On December 3, 1864, the Reverend Bill Sketoe, was unjustly hanged near the banks of the Choctawhatchee River in Newton, Alabama. Sketoe was the pastor of the local Methodist church. When the Civil War began, he decided to join the Confederate Army. After a few years of fighting for the Confederacy, his wife became gravely ill. Upon hearing this news, he hired a substitute to take his place on the battlefield and headed back to Newton to be with his wife. After spending some time back at home, a local group of men, who put themselves in charge of punishing deserters, became suspicious that he was a traitor. One day, the men decided to punish Sketoe. The men ambushed him and tied a noose around his neck. With his hands and feet bound, the men beat him. Sketoe was placed into a buggy and positioned below a tree. The rope was thrown over a branch and secured. One of the men whipped the horse attached to the buggy, leaving Sketoe dangling from the branch. The hanging, however, did not go quite as planned. The branch of the oak tree bent from Sketoe\u2019s weight and his toes touched the ground. Upon realizing he could breathe, one of the men, who was a cripple, used his crutch to dig out a hole beneath Sketoe\u2019s feet. This allowed the noose to tighten, ending the life of Bill Sketoe. It is believed that he haunted the 6 men who all had violent deaths. For a number of years, the townspeople realized that the hole would not stay filled. Even if they put enough dirt and brush so that there was a small mound, the hole would be dug back out by the next morning. It is believed that the ghost of Bill Sketoe keeps the hole cleaned out. At one point, two workers who were working on a bridge over the Choctawhatchee River decided to camp beneath the tree that Sketoe was hanged from. Knowing the story of the hole, they filled it up prior to setting up their tent. When the two men took down the tent the following morning, the hole had been dug up beneath them while they slept.",
