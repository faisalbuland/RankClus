        "content": "\"Civilian casualties\" are loosely defined in Astan as anybody who dies as a result of a battle and can't be proven in a California courtroom to have been an active participant in 10 minutes or less. \"Airstrike\" is an indication that something explosive fell from the sky. Since planes and helicopters both fly through the air, everything which might be attributed to them (ie explosive items which fall from the sky) is an \"airstrike\", usually associated with a \"raid\". \"Raid\" is any action resulting in dead bad guys. As a rule, there are no actual battles, only \"raids\" with \"airstrikes\" resulting in \"civilian casualties\". \"Suspected militant\" is an indication once more of the California courtroom rule. Everybody is innocent until proven guilty, you have 10 minutes, time's up. \"Insurgent\" is a blanket term which in the media means \"blatantly obvious enemy combatant of any origin or group and variable motivation.\" These are my favorites, but feel free to add to the list or comment as you wish. Have fun.",
