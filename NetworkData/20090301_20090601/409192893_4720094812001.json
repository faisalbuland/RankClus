(AP) -- A busload of activists -- outnumbered 2-to-1 by reporters and photographers -- are paying visits to the homes of American International Group Inc. executives in Connecticut to protest tens of millions in bonuses awarded by the company. About 40 protesters parked at a cul-de-sac Saturday afternoon and walked to the Fairfield home of Douglas Polling. They were met on the curb by two security guards, and one activist read a letter detailing the financial struggles that many Connecticut residents have faced. The group then left the note in Polling's mailbox. Polling already agreed to forfeit his bonus, but the protesters want AIG executives to do more to help working families.

(AP) -- A busload of activists -- outnumbered 2-to-1 by reporters and photographers -- are paying visits to the homes of American International Group Inc. executives in Connecticut to protest tens of millions in bonuses awarded by the company. About 40 protesters parked at a cul-de-sac Saturday afternoon and walked to the Fairfield home of Douglas Polling. They were met on the curb by two security guards, and one activist read a letter detailing the financial struggles that many Connecticut residents have faced. The group then left the note in Polling's mailbox. Polling already agreed to forfeit his bonus, but the protesters want AIG executives to do more to help working families.

Well, I'll be horns waggled, I haven't seen such a pi*******contest in a long time.

Personally I have the same thoughts towards the professional athletes with the MFL and MLB In any case what might need to be accomplished to bring these fat cats to their knees, would be to create \"mass exodus days\", where no one purchases what ever products we are boycotting. Say, for example the population must come to an agreement in order to make it happen correctly, by avoiding certain products for a month of maybe even longer. Let's take the auto industry for example. A group decision is made to General Motors products for three months. Across the nation, what's happening? No one is buying and GM products, and for five or six months, this would be or almost be out on the streets. If the citizens as a whole can come together to give a business the cold shoulder effect I most sincerely suggest we will succeed with \"coercing\" with them to see things as we feel should be. That being no one receives more then 20 percent then the lowest man in the factory makes sweeping up the slag's. That bonuses are a thing of the past.

You know this is the best means we could control the sale of everything in this world. If the world took the stance that no one would buy a Chevy S-10 for example for a year. Do you realize what that would do to the markets? It would cause crippling effects that would be darn near permanent. How about an entire line of general motors products?......Ringo",
