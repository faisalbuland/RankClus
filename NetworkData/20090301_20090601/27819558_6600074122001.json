Nothing better than a bunch of women parading themselves across stage in slinky gowns and cover-nothing bikinis and pretending that it's a scholarship competition. 2. Miss California is certainly entitled to her opinion. The audience is equally entitled to react to it. 3. Miss California wouldn't have won the competition anyway. From the reports I heard, she didn't win either the evening gown nor the swimsuit competition. Her stumbling, bumbling answer to the Q&A part of the competition had nothing to do with her win or loss. 4. Perez Hilton doesn't speak for anyone but himself. There are stupid straight people, and there are stupid gay people. Hell, look at Paris Hilton, and there's a fine example of a stupid straight person who says stupid things. 5. Even if Miss California had a shot at the crown, it was NOT the answer to her question, but HOW she answered it that would have lost. She fumbled, plain and simple. She didn't even make an attempt to formulate a social commentary about law, or the reasons for her opinions, or the facts behind the issue. Instead, from the transcript of her answer, she pretty much said, \"I believe this because my mommy and daddy told me to.\" (ie. \"I was raised to believe...\") That's pretty weak. 6. It was a stupid question to ask in a pageant anyway. Beauty queens aren't necessarily deep thinkers. Look at Sarah Palin.",

Beauty pageants have no IQ, so they are not stupid despite your opinion. They often lead contestants to very lucrative careers. 2. The reaction of the audience ought to be irrelevant to an objective judge. Otherwise, there is no need for a judge. 3. Contestants have won in the past despite not being number one in any of the individual competitions. 4. Greater care must be exercised to insure that people like Hilton are not given the authority of a judge. 5. You're among a minority of people who think that Miss California had no chance. Most people become who they are in large measure by how they were raised and there is nothing weak about it. 6. The question was quite obviously designed to bring an issue to the fore that ought not have been. The end result was that a young lady was publicly trashed for no good reason. She may or may not have been a 'deep thinker' and most of us aren't, either.
