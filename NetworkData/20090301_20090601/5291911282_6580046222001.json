My question is: Does the DOD have any programs designed to assist separating military spouses? I am an educated woman (2 bachelor degrees), however now that the country in in a recession, it is almost next to impossible to get a job so that I can provide support for my 6 year old son.

They provide marriage counseling and the like, but once you make the decision to divorce, you are on your own. They will move you on their dime, but that's about it. You need to get all the proper paperwork in order to start child support, assuming you will have full custody. You have 2 bach degrees, I'm certain you could find 'something' even if it's a small paycut. \"It is the weak who are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong\" -- Leo Roskin",

No, I am not looking for someone to support me and I feel that it is absolutely shameful that some people think that a well educated person cant (or is not allowed to) fall on hard times. Shame on you. Also, if you know anything about the economy in Southern CA, then you would know that the cost of living is extremely high, so no, a job at Wal-Mart is not IMMEDIATELY sufficient enough to support a family. All I am looking for is help to get me to a location that is not as costly as place that I currently reside (because of a husband that I HAVE SUPPORTED) and to a place (my home) where a job at Wal-Mart could very well pay rent.",

My question is: Does the DOD have any programs designed to assist separating military spouses? I am an educated woman (2 bachelor degrees), however now that the country in in a recession, it is almost next to impossible to get a job so that I can provide support for my 6 year old son. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Signed, Get me out of here. Rhondajae, You have no friends? Were you working before and then laid off? Have you tried civil service? Have you thought about enlisting? What will happen to the six-year-old? Divorces are so hard on the children. Is there no way you will reconsider? Perhaps a separation while going to marriage counseling could be the answer... \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",

I dont really have any family that I can depend on, and my husband has made sure that I dont have any friends (any that I can go to for that type of support. My fiends are his co-workers).
