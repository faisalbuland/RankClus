According to the Department, nominations for this award will be limited to those extraordinary cases where individuals have demonstrated exceptionally outstanding service of substantial and long term benefit to the Navy, Marine Corps, or as Department of the Navy as a whole.

Everything I've read on the man says he spent his tour in a battalion TOC as a staff officer. He was awarded two purple hearts. Their validity has been called into question by close personal associates of his. He volunteered while a Marine Reservist for a tour in Vietnam from 1966 to 1967. He was as I said a Battalion Staff officer. By 1969 he was serving in the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 1980 he was involved (on the bad side) in ABSCAM. (Look it up Gen-Y and forward). For his efforts in making this war even more unpopular, and as a concession for losing the race for House Majority Leader, in which he had Pelosi's endorsement, he was rewarded with the position of CHAIRMAN of the House Defense Appropriations Committee. APPROPRIATIONS Now come on. ANYBODY can see here the Navy wants something and they are greasing the wheels. Which is what you have to do when you are dependant upon slime balls who malign their fellow service men for political advantage, endeavour to sell out America's interests to FBI agents posing as Arab Shieks, and fudge up paperwork for enough Purple Hearts to get you sent home a hero with a promising political career after spending your \"war\" in a TOC with all the beer and hooch girls you could want.

While I think Murtha's comments on Haditha were inappropriate, he lost my respect long before that. Candidly, I don't see how anyone can watch the ABSCAM tapes and believe the man should still be in office ... but that's just me. I feel the same way about Dodd and his nationally televised lie on AIG (and retard that I was, I believed him).",

Which is what you have to do when you are dependant upon slime balls who malign their fellow service men for political advantage, endeavour to sell out America's interests to FBI agents posing as Arab Shieks, and fudge up paperwork for enough Purple Hearts to get you sent home a hero with a promising political career after spending your \"war\" in a TOC with all the beer and hooch girls you could want.

Winter. From the press release: It is the highest form of public service recognition bestowed by the Department of the Navy for a non-employee. According to the Department, nominations for this award will be limited to those extraordinary cases where individuals have demonstrated exceptionally outstanding service of substantial and long term benefit to the Navy, Marine Corps, or as Department of the Navy as a whole. The Citation reads (Attention to Orders) : Congressman Murtha\u2019s selfless devotion to the Nation\u2019s Sailors and Marines ensured they were provided the resources necessary to effectively conduct the Global War on Terrorism.

While I think Murtha's comments on Haditha were inappropriate, he lost my respect long before that. Candidly, I don't see how anyone can watch the ABSCAM tapes and believe the man should still be in office ... but that's just me.
