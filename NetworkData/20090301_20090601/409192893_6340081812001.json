Everyone seems to get p rickley about the \"mandatory\" thing: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on legislation to expand volunteer service. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S.227, the Serve America Act. This legislation significantly expands national community service programs, strengthens key components of the AmeriCorps program, and aims to engage 250,000 volunteers in targeted service to areas of national need. The House of Representatives is considering similar legislation, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education (GIVE) Act. Neither the Serve America Act nor the GIVE Act require mandatory national service. Community service is more important than ever during tough economic times, and this bill will allow more Americans to help their neighbors who are struggling to obtain health care, afford energy costs, or feed their families. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this issue, and I will certainly keep your views in mind as the Senate considers additional legislation on community service. Thank you again for writing.",
