A kid who did not pass his work might very well be passed on to the next grade just to keep him with his peers. For instance, there were 15 of us in my senior class, but only 14 graduated because one didn't have enough credits to even be a sophomore. And, there was a reverse case in a class before me. One kid had the credits to graduate, but failed the 12th grade 3 times. Why? Because Oklahoma rules said that a high school kid could play basketball up to the age of 21, so they just kept failing this kid to keep him on the team as long as possible. It was OK with him. It was never as cut and dried as everyone thinks and it was even true in college. I graduated in 1974 with several classmates who couldn't write a coherent sentence, yet they passed and got the same sheepskin as me.",

Well...the answer to whether or not we had to reach a certain level before being promoted is yes and no. Theoretically, that was true, but they also practiced social advancement back then too. A kid who did not pass his work might very well be passed on to the next grade just to keep him with his peers. For instance, there were 15 of us in my senior class, but only 14 graduated because one didn't have enough credits to even be a sophomore. And, there was a reverse case in a class before me. One kid had the credits to graduate, but failed the 12th grade 3 times. Why? Because Oklahoma rules said that a high school kid could play basketball up to the age of 21, so they just kept failing this kid to keep him on the team as long as possible. It was OK with him. It was never as cut and dried as everyone thinks and it was even true in college.

Not too very long ago I saw in the news where quite a few Alcorn nursing students failed the exit exams. Not a good thing to think about when one depends on a nurse, is it? Well...the answer to whether or not we had to reach a certain level before being promoted is yes and no. Theoretically, that was true, but they also practiced social advancement back then too. A kid who did not pass his work might very well be passed on to the next grade just to keep him with his peers. For instance, there were 15 of us in my senior class, but only 14 graduated because one didn't have enough credits to even be a sophomore. And, there was a reverse case in a class before me. One kid had the credits to graduate, but failed the 12th grade 3 times. Why? Because Oklahoma rules said that a high school kid could play basketball up to the age of 21, so they just kept failing this kid to keep him on the team as long as possible. It was OK with him. It was never as cut and dried as everyone thinks and it was even true in college. I graduated in 1974 with several classmates who couldn't write a coherent sentence, yet they passed and got the same sheepskin as me.",

I think that to qualify for public funds the course of study must be something that isn't being met through normal means. Aka lets not waste tax payer dollars on liberal arts. Math, science, engineering! Can't make it that hard but those seeking those fields should absolutely be given all the assisatance they need so long as they can keep up with the work.. Now that I can go along with! I also agree with Thud on this issue. If someone has the grades and can pass the entrance exam without having to dumb it down, by all means help them go to collage. But, like you, I would not want it waisted in general studies or some liberal arts. This country is lacking in the basics and that should be the focus.",
