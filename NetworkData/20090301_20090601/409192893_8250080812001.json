        "content": "Deval Patrick, King of Mass, made a campign promise to not give state jobs to his political supporters.. Well..while on vacation Patrick's admin announced the hiring of state hack, Marian Walsh to a 175K a year job... That had been unfilled for....12...years. Suddenly in the middle of this economic crisis, while firefighters serving in the reserves in Iraq are being laid off..yup the job needed to be filled. What a country! From+++wtkk.com: Now it's Jim and Carol and Marian and Deval. Thanks to Patrick's weakness for the political equivalent of hack porn, we now have a large enough cast to film our own X-rated version of Deval's treatment of the Massachusetts taxpayers. First there was Jim Aloisi, noted dirtbag leftover of the Big Dig. Then Friday we found out about Marian \"the naughty librarian\" Walsh and her $175k money shot. And now, meet Carol Aloisi, gettin' down and dirty with your tax dollars: Her title was chief of staff, but she had no staff and reported to no one. That did not prevent Carol Aloisi from collecting a $60,000 State House salary for six months, until a state representative found her - literally - sitting in his new office and put her to work. Aloisi, the sister of state Transportation Secretary James Aloisi Jr., was assigned in August by House leaders to the onetime office of former state representative Rachel Kaprielian months after Kaprielian had vacated her post to head up the state Registry of Motor Vehicles. The 49-year-old Aloisi was assigned by DiMasi's office to work for Springfield Representative Cheryl Coakley-Rivera in 2005...But her work was marked by absences and health problems, beginning with a back injury that kept her out several months, Coakley-Rivera said. The injury came weeks after Coakley-Rivera raised questions about the accuracy of Aloisi's time records with House personnel officials, a state official said...Also last summer, Aloisi was among the State House aides who got a 3 percent pay raise, according to state payroll records. Oh, and did I mention she's a Democratic State Committeewoman? That's her in the photo above celebrating Gov. Patrick's victory. How hot is THAT? A pay raise on a no-show job for a super-hack's sister who just happens to be an official in Deval's own party. So sleazy! So dirty. So...Deval.",
