Barack Obama is the first African-American president, so the prime minister gave him an ornamental desk-pen holder hewn from the timbers of one of the Royal Navy's anti-slaving ships of the 19th century, HMS Gannet. Even more appropriate, in 1909 the Gannet was renamed HMS President. The president's guest also presented him with the framed commission for HMS Resolute, the lost British ship retrieved from the Arctic and returned by America to London, and whose timbers were used for a thank-you gift Queen Victoria sent to Rutherford Hayes: the handsome desk that now sits in the Oval Office.And, just to round things out, as a little stocking stuffer, Gordon Brown gave President Obama a first edition of Sir Martin Gilbert's seven-volume biography of Winston Churchill. In return, America's head of state gave the prime minister 25 DVDs of 'classic American movies.' Evidently, the White House gift shop was all out of 'MY GOVERNMENT DELEGATION WENT TO WASHINGTON AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT' T-shirts. Still, the 'classic American movies' set is a pretty good substitute, and it can set you back as much as $38.99 at Wal-Mart.\" --columnist Mark Steyn",

Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, presented him with a red plastic button emblazoned with the English word \u201creset\u201d and the Russian word \u201cperegruzka.\u201d The gift was a play on Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s call in Munich last month for the two countries to \u201cpress the reset button\u201d on their relationship. \u201cWe worked hard to get the right Russian word,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, handing the button to Mr. Lavrov. \u201cDo you think we got it?\u201d \u201cYou got it wrong,\u201d he replied, explaining that the Americans had come up with the Russian word for overcharged. \"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/world/europe/07diplo.html?em\"", 
        "reply": "Whatever \"no-class\" bug POTUS 44 has, the SECSTATE apparently also caught ...  Doesn't say much for the translators at the State Department ... worked so hard and still screwed it up. Yep ... \"ready on Day 1\" ... amateurs.",

Even more appropriate, in 1909 the Gannet was renamed HMS President. The president's guest also presented him with the framed commission for HMS Resolute, the lost British ship retrieved from the Arctic and returned by America to London, and whose timbers were used for a thank-you gift Queen Victoria sent to Rutherford Hayes: the handsome desk that now sits in the Oval Office.And, just to round things out, as a little stocking stuffer, Gordon Brown gave President Obama a first edition of Sir Martin Gilbert's seven-volume biography of Winston Churchill. In return, America's head of state gave the prime minister 25 DVDs of 'classic American movies.' Evidently, the White House gift shop was all out of 'MY GOVERNMENT DELEGATION WENT TO WASHINGTON AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT' T-shirts.
