Two years ago I had a Sri Lankan West Point cadet for a few weeks in a summer program where he shadowed me as a Platoon Leader. In OCS we had Jamaican candidates, and in the OBC we had 4 Egyptian officers. Other classes had students from Pakistan, Germany, UK, Congo, and many others. In OCS at FT Benning one of the instructors was an Australian SGM. In Iraq I worked for Multinational Security Transistion Command, which includes the Nato Training Mission - Iraq. I worked closely with Czechs, Latvians, Estonians, Danish, Australians, British, and others. Getting some experience in a multinational environment will be valuable for that LT.",
