My BC DI's were fresh VN combat experienced, they were NOT GENTLE, they were Xtremely Rough, to say the least. I am very grateful for the harsh training those Marines (DIs) gave me. (I believe some of us are born warriors, our bloodline has a historic legacy. By the time I entered BC, I had already been in several real fights and had seen plenty of violance and a couple of deaths....) I wish I could see how BC is conducted today, how has the training improved. While in the MC I was obessed with death and fighting. I was also in the Best condition of my life. Bruce Lee was at his best, I would have loved to sparr with him.. There was a group of us Marines that trained together and we usually fought full contact, No pads, on sunday afernoons...There were plain mean street fighters, tae kuando, karate, kung fu, many different styles, it was awesome. I kicked alot of butt and got my butt kicked as well. In 1973 when I was a Lance Corporal, I developed my idea of \"One Move, One Kill,\" in less that 2 seconds. I also deformed my hands, seeking the Iron Palm and arm joints punching air while doing Katas. What ignorance. I have trained and studied MAs over 38+ years, I have also abandoned all of my karate connections. I do not believe in tournments or the I touched you first system. That gives false hope and confidence to the student. While I respect and honor classical and traditional MAs, I prefer my own Martial Science. (Forgive me for getting side tracked.) I hope that the h2h Marine program gets better every cycle. Keep it real and simple.",

Then in the fleet it was mainly an everyday occurance that we had all out company rumbles. What else are you gonna do when they leave you standing there for an hr or so waiting in formation. You start talking crap then you rumble. Always got the new boots to try an run through the other platoons formation. That would always set it off. Was great and a good experience and a way to get that killer instinct. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
