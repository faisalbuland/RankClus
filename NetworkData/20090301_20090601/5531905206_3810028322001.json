So my question to FinCEN is, how and why did you allow this economic fiasco to occur? Why do we even have this agency and waste $$Billions of dollars on a bunch of government losers, that failed to see the corruption and the greed, by politicians and CEOs, which in turn caused our economic collapse.",

FinCen has to operate under the law, and though they could see hinky activity, they could prove no crime. i liken it to watching a train wreck. it is horrible to see, but you JUST HAVE TO WATCH.",
