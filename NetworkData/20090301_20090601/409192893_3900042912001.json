        "content": "I have noticed several threads that have attacked Obama's \"speech.\" Remember these?? People say, how can I help on this war against terror? How can I fight evil? You can do so by mentoring a child; by going into a shut-in's house and say I love you. There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee - that says, fool me once, shame on - shame on you. Fool me - you can't get fooled again. I'm thrilled to be here in the bread basket of America because it gives me a chance to remind our fellow citizens that we have an advantage here in America - we can feed ourselves. I'd rather have them sacrificing on behalf of our nation than, you know, endless hours of testimony on congressional hill. And so, in my State of the - my State of the Union - or state - my speech to the nation, whatever you want to call it, speech to the nation - I asked Americans to give 4,000 years - 4,000 hours over the next - the rest of your life - of service to America. That's what I asked - 4,000 hours. It would be a mistake for the United States Senate to allow any kind of human cloning to come out of that chamber. Russia is no longer our enemy and therefore we shouldn't be locked into a Cold War mentality that says we keep the peace by blowing each other up. In my attitude, that's old, that's tired, that's stale. Columbia carried in its payroll classroom experiments from some of our students in America. The war on terror involves Saddam Hussein because of the nature of Saddam Hussein, the history of Saddam Hussein, and his willingness to terrorize himself. One year ago today, the time for excuse-making has come to an end. I think the American people - I hope the American - I don't think, let me - I hope the American people trust me. There's only one person who hugs the mothers and the widows, the wives and the kids upon the death of their loved one. Others hug but having committed the troops, I've got an additional responsibility to hug and that's me and I know what it's like. The law I sign today directs new funds and new focus to the task of collecting vital intelligence on terrorist threats and on weapons of mass production. I was proud the other day when both Republicans and Democrats stood with me in the Rose Garden to announce their support for a clear statement of purpose: you disarm, or we will. First, we would not accept a treaty that would not have been ratified, nor a treaty that I thought made sense for the country. This administration is doing everything we can to end the stalemate in an efficient way. We're making the right decisions to bring the solution to an end. Ann and I will carry out this equivocal message to the world: Markets must be open. We're concerned about AIDS inside our White House - make no mistake about it. I am mindful not only of preserving executive powers for myself, but for predecessors as well. I'm hopeful. I know there is a lot of ambition in Washington, obviously. But I hope the ambitious realize that they are more likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure. You can fool some of the people all the time, and those are the ones you want to concentrate on. We're concerned about AIDS inside our White House -- make no mistake about it. This notion that the United States is getting ready to attack Iran is simply ridiculous. And having said that, all options are on the table. Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we. I frankly felt like the reception we received on the way in from the airport was very warm and hospitable. And I want to thank the Canadian people who came out to wave -- with all five fingers -- for their hospitality. When I take action, I'm not going to fire a $2 million missile at a $10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt. It's going to be decisive. This administration is doing everything we can to end the stalemate in an efficient way. We're making the right decisions to bring the solution to an end. There's no bigger task than protecting the homeland of our country. I firmly believe the death tax is good for people from all walks of life all throughout our society. Ahhh, Bush. That guy was good for something. \"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.\" Thomas Jefferson",
