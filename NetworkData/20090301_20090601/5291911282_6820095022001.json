I think this is great, the Senator gives the family a dog that could potentially save one of the first kids from a watery death. According to the news Teddy has three of these dogs and felt that Barry needed one. The only thing I wanna know is how long has he been raising these dogs and why didn't he have one with him at Chappaquiddick? Maybe he forsees Barry in deep water, but I do think this is a weird irony. WOW, I just hope that this dog is well taken care of and these kids learn some responsibility with raising another living thing. A dog is a huge responsibility and I hope it doesn't fall onto the already overworked staff. Maybe more pictures of the kids playing with the dog would portray a comfortable and happy first family. Anybody have one of these Portuguese Water Dogs? Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
