Now this is SO damn disappointing, a whole three hours before the photo op meme was thrown out as the reason the CinC went to Arlington Cemetery. quote: Pool Report #2, March 25, 2009 Unannounced visit to Arlington Cemetery After meeting privately with Senate Democrats at the Capitol (where he said little to the throng of reporters waiting outside the meeting room), POTUS made an unannounced trip to Arlington Cemetery to participate in the wreath-laying ceremony for National Medal of Honor Day. There was no heads-up for the pool, which found itself, to its surprise, suddenly crossing the Memorial Bridge instead of returning to the White House from the Capitol. POTUS left the Capitol at 1:54 p.m. and arrived at the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater at 2:05 pm. He spent roughly 15 minutes at the cemetery. Pool was ushered around the amphitheater to an area behind a rope line adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknowns, facing the amphitheater building. About 30 Medal of Honor recipients, wearing medals around their necks, stood in two separate rows facing the Tomb with their backs to the amphitheater building. Many of these medal recipients appeared to be World War Two veterans, others from Korea and Vietnam. Several hundred sightseers and tourists, who happened to be visiting the cemetery this day, stood behind rope lines behind the veterans, also facing the tomb. One group of school kids wore matching, white \u201cSt. Isidore\u201d sweatshirts. At 2:11 pm, POTUS began walking down the steps of the amphitheater building toward the tomb, with two veterans at his side, one of them behind helped down the steps by a soldier in uniform. Two other Medal of Honor recipients, using canes and looking quite frail, followed down the steps. The president and the four medal recipients walked together toward a large flowered wreath, bearing the words, \u201cMedal of Honor Day,\u201d that was carried on a stand and placed between them and the Tomb. When he the reached the wreath, POTUS said something inaudible, and put his hands on the wreath, as did the others, with the president now flanked by two veterans on each side. The five then placed their right hands on their hearts as a drum roll began, and Taps was played. Then all the medal recipients formed a receiving line and the President stopped to shake hands and talked briefly with each one. His demeanor was mostly solemn but he grinned and hugged a few. We were told a few of the men were acquaintances of POTUS, but we haven\u2019t been able yet to determine which ones. The four men listed as participating with POTUS in the actual wreath-laying \u2013 the four who accompanied him to the wreath -- were Lt. John W. Finn (USN retired, WW2 vet) 99, of Los Angeles; Capt. Thomas J. Hudner (USN retired, Korean War vet) 84, of Fall River, Mass.; Col. Joe M. Jackson (USAF retired, Vietnam vet) 85, of Newman Ga.; and Col. Robert L. Howard (US Army retired, Vietnam vet), 69, Opelika, Ala. One of the veterans \u2013 we were told it was Finn -- sat in a wheelchair in the receiving line after the ceremony. According to a fact sheet from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, more than 30 of the 98 living Medal of Honor recipients participated in the ceremony. >>>http://www.politicalbase.com/profile/Mark%20Nickolas/blog/&blogId=6710 It\u2019s rather sad that some people so dislike (hate is such a strong word) the President that they see nothing wrong with using his participation in a tribute to the memory of our most respected military as an opportunity to throw muck on the man and in so doing dirty the occasion as well.

Now this is SO damn disappointing, a whole three hours before the photo op meme was thrown out as the reason the CinC went to Arlington Cemetery. quote: Pool Report #2, March 25, 2009 Unannounced visit to Arlington Cemetery After meeting privately with Senate Democrats at the Capitol (where he said little to the throng of reporters waiting outside the meeting room), POTUS made an unannounced trip to Arlington Cemetery to participate in the wreath-laying ceremony for National Medal of Honor Day. There was no heads-up for the pool, which found itself, to its surprise, suddenly crossing the Memorial Bridge instead of returning to the White House from the Capitol. POTUS left the Capitol at 1:54 p.m. and arrived at the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater at 2:05 pm. He spent roughly 15 minutes at the cemetery. Pool was ushered around the amphitheater to an area behind a rope line adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknowns, facing the amphitheater building. About 30 Medal of Honor recipients, wearing medals around their necks, stood in two separate rows facing the Tomb with their backs to the amphitheater building. Many of these medal recipients appeared to be World War Two veterans, others from Korea and Vietnam. Several hundred sightseers and tourists, who happened to be visiting the cemetery this day, stood behind rope lines behind the veterans, also facing the tomb. One group of school kids wore matching, white \u201cSt. Isidore\u201d sweatshirts. At 2:11 pm, POTUS began walking down the steps of the amphitheater building toward the tomb, with two veterans at his side, one of them behind helped down the steps by a soldier in uniform. Two other Medal of Honor recipients, using canes and looking quite frail, followed down the steps. The president and the four medal recipients walked together toward a large flowered wreath, bearing the words, \u201cMedal of Honor Day,\u201d that was carried on a stand and placed between them and the Tomb. When he the reached the wreath, POTUS said something inaudible, and put his hands on the wreath, as did the others, with the president now flanked by two veterans on each side. The five then placed their right hands on their hearts as a drum roll began, and Taps was played.

        "reply": " Now this is SO damn disappointing, a whole three hours before the photo op meme was thrown out as the reason the CinC went to Arlington Cemetery. quote: Pool Report #2, March 25, 2009 Unannounced visit to Arlington Cemetery After meeting privately with Senate Democrats at the Capitol (where he said little to the throng of reporters waiting outside the meeting room), POTUS made an unannounced trip to Arlington Cemetery to participate in the wreath-laying ceremony for National Medal of Honor Day. There was no heads-up for the pool, which found itself, to its surprise, suddenly crossing the Memorial Bridge instead of returning to the White House from the Capitol. POTUS left the Capitol at 1:54 p.m. and arrived at the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater at 2:05 pm. He spent roughly 15 minutes at the cemetery. Pool was ushered around the amphitheater to an area behind a rope line adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknowns, facing the amphitheater building. About 30 Medal of Honor recipients, wearing medals around their necks, stood in two separate rows facing the Tomb with their backs to the amphitheater building. Many of these medal recipients appeared to be World War Two veterans, others from Korea and Vietnam. Several hundred sightseers and tourists, who happened to be visiting the cemetery this day, stood behind rope lines behind the veterans, also facing the tomb. One group of school kids wore matching, white \u201cSt. Isidore\u201d sweatshirts. At 2:11 pm, POTUS began walking down the steps of the amphitheater building toward the tomb, with two veterans at his side, one of them behind helped down the steps by a soldier in uniform. Two other Medal of Honor recipients, using canes and looking quite frail, followed down the steps. The president and the four medal recipients walked together toward a large flowered wreath, bearing the words, \u201cMedal of Honor Day,\u201d that was carried on a stand and placed between them and the Tomb. When he the reached the wreath, POTUS said something inaudible, and put his hands on the wreath, as did the others, with the president now flanked by two veterans on each side. The five then placed their right hands on their hearts as a drum roll began, and Taps was played. Then all the medal recipients formed a receiving line and the President stopped to shake hands and talked briefly with each one. His demeanor was mostly solemn but he grinned and hugged a few. We were told a few of the men were acquaintances of POTUS, but we haven\u2019t been able yet to determine which ones.

Now this is SO damn disappointing, a whole three hours before the photo op meme was thrown out as the reason the CinC went to Arlington Cemetery. quote: Pool Report #2, March 25, 2009 Unannounced visit to Arlington Cemetery After meeting privately with Senate Democrats at the Capitol (where he said little to the throng of reporters waiting outside the meeting room), POTUS made an unannounced trip to Arlington Cemetery to participate in the wreath-laying ceremony for National Medal of Honor Day. There was no heads-up for the pool, which found itself, to its surprise, suddenly crossing the Memorial Bridge instead of returning to the White House from the Capitol. POTUS left the Capitol at 1:54 p.m. and arrived at the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater at 2:05 pm. He spent roughly 15 minutes at the cemetery. Pool was ushered around the amphitheater to an area behind a rope line adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknowns, facing the amphitheater building. About 30 Medal of Honor recipients, wearing medals around their necks, stood in two separate rows facing the Tomb with their backs to the amphitheater building. Many of these medal recipients appeared to be World War Two veterans, others from Korea and Vietnam. Several hundred sightseers and tourists, who happened to be visiting the cemetery this day, stood behind rope lines behind the veterans, also facing the tomb. One group of school kids wore matching, white \u201cSt. Isidore\u201d sweatshirts. At 2:11 pm, POTUS began walking down the steps of the amphitheater building toward the tomb, with two veterans at his side, one of them behind helped down the steps by a soldier in uniform. Two other Medal of Honor recipients, using canes and looking quite frail, followed down the steps. The president and the four medal recipients walked together toward a large flowered wreath, bearing the words, \u201cMedal of Honor Day,\u201d that was carried on a stand and placed between them and the Tomb. When he the reached the wreath, POTUS said something inaudible, and put his hands on the wreath, as did the others, with the president now flanked by two veterans on each side. The five then placed their right hands on their hearts as a drum roll began, and Taps was played. Then all the medal recipients formed a receiving line and the President stopped to shake hands and talked briefly with each one. His demeanor was mostly solemn but he grinned and hugged a few. We were told a few of the men were acquaintances of POTUS, but we haven\u2019t been able yet to determine which ones. The four men listed as participating with POTUS in the actual wreath-laying \u2013 the four who accompanied him to the wreath -- were Lt. John W. Finn (USN retired, WW2 vet) 99, of Los Angeles; Capt. Thomas J. Hudner (USN retired, Korean War vet) 84, of Fall River, Mass.; Col. Joe M. Jackson (USAF retired, Vietnam vet) 85, of Newman Ga.; and Col. Robert L. Howard (US Army retired, Vietnam vet), 69, Opelika, Ala. One of the veterans \u2013 we were told it was Finn -- sat in a wheelchair in the receiving line after the ceremony. According to a fact sheet from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, more than 30 of the 98 living Medal of Honor recipients participated in the ceremony. >>>http://www.politicalbase.com/profile/Mark%20Nickolas/blog/&blogId=6710 It\u2019s rather sad that some people so dislike (hate is such a strong word) the President that they see nothing wrong with using his participation in a tribute to the memory of our most respected military as an opportunity to throw muck on the man and in so doing dirty the occasion as well. JMHO of course!!",

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 a photo op for the teleprompter kid, after trying to get our wounded war heros to pay for their own medical care! Now this is SO damn disappointing, a whole three hours before the photo op meme was thrown out as the reason the CinC went to Arlington Cemetery. quote: Pool Report #2, March 25, 2009 Unannounced visit to Arlington Cemetery After meeting privately with Senate Democrats at the Capitol (where he said little to the throng of reporters waiting outside the meeting room), POTUS made an unannounced trip to Arlington Cemetery to participate in the wreath-laying ceremony for National Medal of Honor Day. There was no heads-up for the pool, which found itself, to its surprise, suddenly crossing the Memorial Bridge instead of returning to the White House from the Capitol. POTUS left the Capitol at 1:54 p.m. and arrived at the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater at 2:05 pm. He spent roughly 15 minutes at the cemetery. Pool was ushered around the amphitheater to an area behind a rope line adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknowns, facing the amphitheater building. About 30 Medal of Honor recipients, wearing medals around their necks, stood in two separate rows facing the Tomb with their backs to the amphitheater building. Many of these medal recipients appeared to be World War Two veterans, others from Korea and Vietnam. Several hundred sightseers and tourists, who happened to be visiting the cemetery this day, stood behind rope lines behind the veterans, also facing the tomb. One group of school kids wore matching, white \u201cSt. Isidore\u201d sweatshirts. At 2:11 pm, POTUS began walking down the steps of the amphitheater building toward the tomb, with two veterans at his side, one of them behind helped down the steps by a soldier in uniform. Two other Medal of Honor recipients, using canes and looking quite frail, followed down the steps. The president and the four medal recipients walked together toward a large flowered wreath, bearing the words, \u201cMedal of Honor Day,\u201d that was carried on a stand and placed between them and the Tomb. When he the reached the wreath, POTUS said something inaudible, and put his hands on the wreath, as did the others, with the president now flanked by two veterans on each side. The five then placed their right hands on their hearts as a drum roll began, and Taps was played. Then all the medal recipients formed a receiving line and the President stopped to shake hands and talked briefly with each one. His demeanor was mostly solemn but he grinned and hugged a few. We were told a few of the men were acquaintances of POTUS, but we haven\u2019t been able yet to determine which ones. The four men listed as participating with POTUS in the actual wreath-laying \u2013 the four who accompanied him to the wreath -- were Lt. John W. Finn (USN retired, WW2 vet) 99, of Los Angeles; Capt. Thomas J. Hudner (USN retired, Korean War vet) 84, of Fall River, Mass.; Col. Joe M. Jackson (USAF retired, Vietnam vet) 85, of Newman Ga.; and Col. Robert L. Howard (US Army retired, Vietnam vet), 69, Opelika, Ala. One of the veterans \u2013 we were told it was Finn -- sat in a wheelchair in the receiving line after the ceremony. According to a fact sheet from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, more than 30 of the 98 living Medal of Honor recipients participated in the ceremony. >>>http://www.politicalbase.com/profile/Mark%20Nickolas/blog/&blogId=6710 It\u2019s rather sad that some people so dislike (hate is such a strong word) the President that they see nothing wrong with using his participation in a tribute to the memory of our most respected military as an opportunity to throw muck on the man and in so doing dirty the occasion as well. JMHO of course!!",
