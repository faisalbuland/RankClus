Now there's a new flag designed by a proud father to recognize those who have paid the ultimate price. Millions of service men and women have laid down their lives for our freedom. And one man is on a mission to see that their sacrifice is never forgotten. \"Everywhere I would see the P.O.W. flag and I thought, 'Wow, what an awesome tribute to that group of individuals,'\" said George Lutz, founder of Honor and Remember. \"They were given a flag to remember that they were missing, that they were captured, and I thought what an honor and then I thought the fallen need a flag.\"",

The Gold star flag should be allowed as an official cerimony to each individual family member kept personal as a personal loss, our national loss is written with the red stripes and those that defended it. Just MHO though. I could go any way on this, but the sole decision should be left up to immediate family members who lost someone. They should take a vote, not congress.",
