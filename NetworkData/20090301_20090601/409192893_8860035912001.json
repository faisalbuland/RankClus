Just look at the scams they are trying to pass to get more OPM. They want to implement cap and trade, which will be a source for more and more OPM. But wait, their addiction to OPM goes even further. On top of that, they want to implement carbon taxes. If you think that would curb their OPM habit, it doesn't come close. They even want to implement GWPRA to get even more OPM. Al Gore loves OPM. He is such a strong supporter of the aforementioned scams, which will get him and his friends more of OPM. OPM even has a big impact on programs and research funded through OPM. They have to abide, or see less and less of OPM. They have been using OPM to influence failing businesses. By giving more and more OPM to these irresponsible businesses, they will continue to operate irresponsibly and, will eventually use more and more of OPM. But, they would never do this with their own stash, they would think it to be outlandish and irresponsible to give their stash to an irresponsible neighbor, or business. They feel that they should not be given their stash, and instead break the habit with laws that are already on the books. They would not want those irresponsible folks draining their stash, so they use everyone else's instead. Due to a \"crisis\" they think that OPM is the answer, and they think they can use all the OPM they want. So, with using all of this OPM, you think everyone else's stash would get a boost. I mean, the government using all of that OPM should net a return. However, their addiction being so bad, the OPM they have taken, and the ones whom have profited from OPM, will offer no return on OPM to everyone. Instead, they will demand more and more of OPM. So, when the Fed, State and local governments abuse OPM, they do not care for reform, in dealing with the OPM they abuse, they want more and more OPM. The only way for the government to break the addiction of OPM, is for those who have earned almost all of the stash, and, which supports all walks of government, is for those people to send a clear message, and break the governments addiction to OPM. If OPM is to be used, it better damn be used responsibly and not be abused. OPM = Other Peoples Money.",
