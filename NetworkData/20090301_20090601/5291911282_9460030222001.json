Currently there are rumors that spin waves have real physical consequences, and that useful technology can be based on such things. If \"torsion fields\" can be used for communication, they could explain such things as telepathy and PK. Most of the recent work has been done in Russia, but now and then interesting things appear in the US as well. So the practical application for this would be for space communications to and from Spacecraft that are on extended missions. If a craft were traveling to Mars for instance, communications would be instantaneous. High speed communications for probes and equipment designed for operating on a far off planet and controlled by a Technician on the Earth. I think that some of the Scientists are worried that the space between the two communication nodes could be hazardous space. Kinda like a microwave? or something like that.
