I mean no aspersions on you Ray, when I say this - I am talking about the article. 1. The article makes believe that there is no difference between embryo stem cells and these derived from amniotic fluid... quote: But Dr. Anthony Atala, head of Wake Forest\u2019s regenerative medicine institute and the senior researcher on the project, said the scientists still don\u2019t know exactly how many different cell types can be made from the stem cells found in amniotic fluid. The scientists said preliminary tests in patients are years away. \"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16514457/.htm 2. No loss of life is involved in this Bill. Only those embryos scheduled for flushing down the toilet (presumably the proper and dignified way of honoring human life) will be used. quote: Representatives Introduce Multiple Stem Cell-Related Bills Reps. Diane DeGette (R-Colo.) and Mike Castle (D-Del.) Feb. 4 introduced the \"Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 873), which would lift the Bush Administration's restriction on federal funding for research using embryonic stem cells created after Aug. 9, 2001. The bill would allow in vitro fertilization clinics to donate embryos for research that otherwise would be discarded. This legislation is similar to legislation previously vetoed by President Bush [see Washington Highlights, June 22, 2007]. A second bill, the \"Stem Cell Research Improvement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 872), also would allow discarded embryos to be used for research, regardless of the date of creation. However, the bill also includes a more explicit ethical framework in the statute as well as a various reporting requirements [see Washington Highlights, Oct. 3, 2008]. \"http://www.aamc.org/advocacy/library/washhigh/2009/022009/start.htm 3. Stem Cell research has yet to pay off in dramatic disease treatment. Par for the course in all new areas of research. But this is not to say they it ain't happening - It's happening right now. quote: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever human trial of a medical treatment derived from embryonic stem cells. \"This marks the beginning of what is potentially a new chapter in medical therapeutics -- one that reaches beyond pills to a new level of healing: the restoration of organ and tissue function achieved by the injection of healthy replacement cells,\" Thomas Okarma, Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) president and chief executive officer, said in a release announcing the FDA decision. Geron, a California bio-technical company, was approved to begin a study of its stem-cell treatment for spinal cord injuries in up to 10 patients, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. \"If safe and effective, the therapy would provide a viable treatment option for thousands of patients who suffer severe spinal cord injuries each year,\" said Richard Fessler, professor of neurological surgery professor at Northwestern University. Limits on stem-cell research imposed by the Bush administration have impeded academic and corporate research. President Barack Obama said during the campaign that overturning research limits was a top priority for his administration. Peter Wilderotter, president and CEO of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called the human trial the \"dawn of basic research being translated into human clinical trials for people living with spinal cord injury.\" (more) \"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/01/23/FDA_OKs_embryonic_stem-cell_human_trial/UPI-56161232728584/ And yes, President Bush did not \"ban\" stem cell research, but as you well know, without Federal support, it's been almost a moot issue. Labs that do research cannot do stem cell research if they accept any Federal money, and those much abllyhooed \"existing\" stem cell lines turned out to be mostly useless. Finally, the wording of the Stem Cell Bills deliberately limit it to embryo's that would be normally discarded - i.e. flushed down the john. I personally suspect that 20 years from now therapies derived from this research will present us with dramatic cures for ailments we never thought possible of dealing with. Those who oppose this research (which harms NO LIFE) should immediately swear an oath to never take advantage of them. Dave",

        "quote": "Originally posted by entmjzi: Ethical embryo storage facilities DO NOT \"flush\" any down the drain. In reality, unless there's been a DOCUMENTED power failure of the back-up generator or a legal document giving permission for destruction after X-ammount of time, all embryos are kept ad infinitum in order to avoid lawsuits. When the decision is made to close the facility, calls are made, registered letters are sent and finally, private detectives - at the clinics expense - are hired trying to find the doners. Then, and only then, will embryos be destroyed. This is not a game nor is it taken lightly. A woman's right to choose is taken very, very seriously in the \"ethical\" realm of this section of medicine. Remember, the reasons for IVF are many. Those embryos can be just her eggs, to be fertalized later (perhaps he had cancer). Or her husband's sperm (maybe he did). Maybe she's stored a donor's eggs for future pregnancies by the same woman (or sperm). Maybe she just can't carry a pregnancy to term and stores her eggs for a surrogate. Or stores her eggs (or his sperm) because she's/he's being deployed and they want a child, no matter what happens. Infertility ain't fun and sure as he77 ain't fair.

Diane DeGette (R-Colo.) and Mike Castle (D-Del.) Feb. 4 introduced the \"Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 873), which would lift the Bush Administration's restriction on federal funding for research using embryonic stem cells created after Aug. 9, 2001. The bill would allow in vitro fertilization clinics to donate embryos for research that otherwise would be discarded. This legislation is similar to legislation previously vetoed by President Bush [see Washington Highlights, June 22, 2007]. A second bill, the \"Stem Cell Research Improvement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 872), also would allow discarded embryos to be used for research, regardless of the date of creation.

Limits on stem-cell research imposed by the Bush administration have impeded academic and corporate research. President Barack Obama said during the campaign that overturning research limits was a top priority for his administration.

Finally, the wording of the Stem Cell Bills deliberately limit it to embryo's that would be normally discarded - i.e. flushed down the john.

I mean no aspersions on you Ray, when I say this - I am talking about the article. 1. The article makes believe that there is no difference between embryo stem cells and these derived from amniotic fluid... quote: But Dr. Anthony Atala, head of Wake Forest\u2019s regenerative medicine institute and the senior researcher on the project, said the scientists still don\u2019t know exactly how many different cell types can be made from the stem cells found in amniotic fluid. The scientists said preliminary tests in patients are years away. \"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16514457/.htm 2. No loss of life is involved in this Bill. Only those embryos scheduled for flushing down the toilet (presumably the proper and dignified way of honoring human life) will be used. quote: Representatives Introduce Multiple Stem Cell-Related Bills Reps. Diane DeGette (R-Colo.) and Mike Castle (D-Del.) Feb. 4 introduced the \"Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 873), which would lift the Bush Administration's restriction on federal funding for research using embryonic stem cells created after Aug. 9, 2001. The bill would allow in vitro fertilization clinics to donate embryos for research that otherwise would be discarded. This legislation is similar to legislation previously vetoed by President Bush [see Washington Highlights, June 22, 2007]. A second bill, the \"Stem Cell Research Improvement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 872), also would allow discarded embryos to be used for research, regardless of the date of creation. However, the bill also includes a more explicit ethical framework in the statute as well as a various reporting requirements [see Washington Highlights, Oct. 3, 2008]. \"http://www.aamc.org/advocacy/library/washhigh/2009/022009/start.htm 3. Stem Cell research has yet to pay off in dramatic disease treatment. Par for the course in all new areas of research. But this is not to say they it ain't happening - It's happening right now. quote: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever human trial of a medical treatment derived from embryonic stem cells. \"This marks the beginning of what is potentially a new chapter in medical therapeutics -- one that reaches beyond pills to a new level of healing: the restoration of organ and tissue function achieved by the injection of healthy replacement cells,\" Thomas Okarma, Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) president and chief executive officer, said in a release announcing the FDA decision. Geron, a California bio-technical company, was approved to begin a study of its stem-cell treatment for spinal cord injuries in up to 10 patients, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. \"If safe and effective, the therapy would provide a viable treatment option for thousands of patients who suffer severe spinal cord injuries each year,\" said Richard Fessler, professor of neurological surgery professor at Northwestern University. Limits on stem-cell research imposed by the Bush administration have impeded academic and corporate research. President Barack Obama said during the campaign that overturning research limits was a top priority for his administration. Peter Wilderotter, president and CEO of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called the human trial the \"dawn of basic research being translated into human clinical trials for people living with spinal cord injury.\" (more) \"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/01/23/FDA_OKs_embryonic_stem-cell_human_trial/UPI-56161232728584/ And yes, President Bush did not \"ban\" stem cell research, but as you well know, without Federal support, it's been almost a moot issue. Labs that do research cannot do stem cell research if they accept any Federal money, and those much abllyhooed \"existing\" stem cell lines turned out to be mostly useless. Finally, the wording of the Stem Cell Bills deliberately limit it to embryo's that would be normally discarded - i.e. flushed down the john. I personally suspect that 20 years from now therapies derived from this research will present us with dramatic cures for ailments we never thought possible of dealing with. Those who oppose this research (which harms NO LIFE) should immediately swear an oath to never take advantage of them. Dave",

Amniotic cells also share many of the positive, unique attributes of embryonic stem cells\". \"http://graphic.pepperdine.edu/perspectives/2007/2007-1-25-stemcells.htm\" On top of that it seems unnecessary the killing of life or even large sums of money to study the whole issue, but that as it may, Congress should have their say in the matter. Since the President got his trillions to play with we might as well send them home or on another convention somewhere, for the good they do, WE don't need a Congress. Now, please continue your rants and raves that don't prove a damn thing. thank you.",
        "reply": " Reading your link above, I must say this is a very dishonest article. I mean no aspersions on you Ray, when I say this - I am talking about the article. 1. The article makes believe that there is no difference between embryo stem cells and these derived from amniotic fluid... quote: But Dr. Anthony Atala, head of Wake Forest\u2019s regenerative medicine institute and the senior researcher on the project, said the scientists still don\u2019t know exactly how many different cell types can be made from the stem cells found in amniotic fluid. The scientists said preliminary tests in patients are years away. \"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16514457/.htm 2. No loss of life is involved in this Bill. Only those embryos scheduled for flushing down the toilet (presumably the proper and dignified way of honoring human life) will be used. quote: Representatives Introduce Multiple Stem Cell-Related Bills Reps. Diane DeGette (R-Colo.) and Mike Castle (D-Del.) Feb. 4 introduced the \"Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 873), which would lift the Bush Administration's restriction on federal funding for research using embryonic stem cells created after Aug. 9, 2001. The bill would allow in vitro fertilization clinics to donate embryos for research that otherwise would be discarded. This legislation is similar to legislation previously vetoed by President Bush [see Washington Highlights, June 22, 2007]. A second bill, the \"Stem Cell Research Improvement Act of 2009\" (H.R. 872), also would allow discarded embryos to be used for research, regardless of the date of creation. However, the bill also includes a more explicit ethical framework in the statute as well as a various reporting requirements [see Washington Highlights, Oct. 3, 2008]. \"http://www.aamc.org/advocacy/library/washhigh/2009/022009/start.htm 3. Stem Cell research has yet to pay off in dramatic disease treatment. Par for the course in all new areas of research. But this is not to say they it ain't happening - It's happening right now. quote: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever human trial of a medical treatment derived from embryonic stem cells. \"This marks the beginning of what is potentially a new chapter in medical therapeutics -- one that reaches beyond pills to a new level of healing: the restoration of organ and tissue function achieved by the injection of healthy replacement cells,\" Thomas Okarma, Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) president and chief executive officer, said in a release announcing the FDA decision. Geron, a California bio-technical company, was approved to begin a study of its stem-cell treatment for spinal cord injuries in up to 10 patients, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. \"If safe and effective, the therapy would provide a viable treatment option for thousands of patients who suffer severe spinal cord injuries each year,\" said Richard Fessler, professor of neurological surgery professor at Northwestern University. Limits on stem-cell research imposed by the Bush administration have impeded academic and corporate research. President Barack Obama said during the campaign that overturning research limits was a top priority for his administration. Peter Wilderotter, president and CEO of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called the human trial the \"dawn of basic research being translated into human clinical trials for people living with spinal cord injury.\" (more) \"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/01/23/FDA_OKs_embryonic_stem-cell_human_trial/UPI-56161232728584/ And yes, President Bush did not \"ban\" stem cell research, but as you well know, without Federal support, it's been almost a moot issue. Labs that do research cannot do stem cell research if they accept any Federal money, and those much abllyhooed \"existing\" stem cell lines turned out to be mostly useless. Finally, the wording of the Stem Cell Bills deliberately limit it to embryo's that would be normally discarded - i.e. flushed down the john. I personally suspect that 20 years from now therapies derived from this research will present us with dramatic cures for ailments we never thought possible of dealing with. Those who oppose this research (which harms NO LIFE) should immediately swear an oath to never take advantage of them. Dave",
