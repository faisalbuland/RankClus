While most owners of these types of animals don't just turn them loose in the backyard, they can get out of their cages and there are always the dim-witted few that try to release them when they don't want them anymore. Take for instance the Asian Snakehead. The fish was originally imported in (illegally I might add) for an asian fish market, but the fish is notorious for escaping and surviving long periods of time (8hours or more) out of water. Some turkey dropped a few in the Potomac and now they're reproducing so fast there is worry that they will wipe out all other species of fish in the River. There is also worry that the fish will spread to other connecting areas off of the Potomac. This is one nasty fish and because of ONE @$$bag who decided to \"let them go free\", now several species of fish may go extinct. So yeah, I'm all for HR 669. Animals shouldn't be carted all over the world just because we think they're cute.",

Um the wild hogs, the ones causing the most problems are domestic. You might want to think a little more before you post. At least do a little research. Here's a novel concept on the hog problem. Shoot to kill and stop with the PETA catch and release crap. Hunt them, shoot them, kill them and I'm sure some homeless shelters would benefit from all that meat. So armywife, just because you don't think something is a pet is a good reason to take away others rights? I agree that state game wardens should enforce state laws. US Fish & Wildlife will enforce this if it passes. Your idea of \"exotic\" differs from mine. Commonly kept birds, reptiles, herps and mammals are not really considered exotics by many. I should get some cheap parakeets, label them as exotic and sell them on craigslist...I could make a fortune since you consider them exotic. Pretty sad. I served my country to preserve my rights. Your husband serves to preserve my rights. YOU sit back, reap the benefits of your husbands service and arm chair quarterback the supportive taking of my rights. Priceless This is all that I'm going to say about the last portion of your post... you have no idea who I am, what I do or anything about my family. My husband, father, grandfather, brother and countless others in my family NOT ONLY served to protect freedoms but also served to protect this country from people that think they have every right to do anything they want. And DO NOT even BEGIN to imply that I take advantage of my disabled husband. On to the the rest of it... Regarding the hog problem domestic pigs are not the problem, I know because my family lives, works and owns a 100 acre ranch out in East Texas and we have a growing hog problem. The problem is domestic pigs that get loose and go ferral then cross breed with wild hogs making a new, very aggressive strain of wild/ferral hogs. We DO shoot to kill, and even eat what we kill, problem comes in that pigs breed fast, a lot faster than you can kill 'em with just guns... now we COULD poision them... but that'd poision the horses and the cattle too since they run on the same areas. And just to throw it in there, where there are hog problems, there aren't homeless shelters... people actually work for a living in those areas. When it comes to things like this, it is the Federal government's job to lay down a law that applies to entire nation, then, the states can add on to that in regards to their specific areas. You want to keep a bird, go find you a nest that the mother has abandoned and raise the hatchlings for yourself, you want a squirrel, do the same thing. You want an aquarium, go catch you some crawfish, a couple perch and a couple small mouth bass... that's a nice little set up for ya. (species may vary depending on your area). I do not think that it is ANYONE'S RIGHT to \"own\" an animal that does not belong here. I do not think that it is ANYONE'S RIGHT to hold an animal captive that is meant to be in the wild... call me old fashioned, but if it isn't a dog or a cat or an animal used for sustinance or work, I don't think it should be a pet. And I don't want some jack@$$ thinking he can raise a tiger next to our cattle ranch and the dang thing get loose and kill the cattle and then have to be shot. Some animals ARE NOT MEANT to live in the US. Sugargliders, parakeets, cockatiels, etc are all beautiful animals, and I'm sure they make great \"pets\" for a lot of people, but each one of those, if introduced into the wild and established a population, could drastically and possibly horribly damage the ecosystem around it. There should be better regulation of what comes in and what goes out.",

Take for instance the Asian Snakehead. The fish was originally imported in (illegally I might add) for an asian fish market, but the fish is notorious for escaping and surviving long periods of time (8hours or more) out of water. Some turkey dropped a few in the Potomac and now they're reproducing so fast there is worry that they will wipe out all other species of fish in the River. There is also worry that the fish will spread to other connecting areas off of the Potomac. This is one nasty fish and because of ONE @$$bag who decided to \"let them go free\", now several species of fish may go extinct. So yeah, I'm all for HR 669. Animals shouldn't be carted all over the world just because we think they're cute.",

Um the wild hogs, the ones causing the most problems are domestic. You might want to think a little more before you post. At least do a little research. Here's a novel concept on the hog problem. Shoot to kill and stop with the PETA catch and release crap. Hunt them, shoot them, kill them and I'm sure some homeless shelters would benefit from all that meat. So armywife, just because you don't think something is a pet is a good reason to take away others rights? I agree that state game wardens should enforce state laws. US Fish & Wildlife will enforce this if it passes. Your idea of \"exotic\" differs from mine. Commonly kept birds, reptiles, herps and mammals are not really considered exotics by many. I should get some cheap parakeets, label them as exotic and sell them on craigslist...I could make a fortune since you consider them exotic. Pretty sad. I served my country to preserve my rights. Your husband serves to preserve my rights. YOU sit back, reap the benefits of your husbands service and arm chair quarterback the supportive taking of my rights. Priceless This is all that I'm going to say about the last portion of your post... you have no idea who I am, what I do or anything about my family. My husband, father, grandfather, brother and countless others in my family NOT ONLY served to protect freedoms but also served to protect this country from people that think they have every right to do anything they want. And DO NOT even BEGIN to imply that I take advantage of my disabled husband. On to the the rest of it... Regarding the hog problem domestic pigs are not the problem, I know because my family lives, works and owns a 100 acre ranch out in East Texas and we have a growing hog problem. The problem is domestic pigs that get loose and go ferral then cross breed with wild hogs making a new, very aggressive strain of wild/ferral hogs. We DO shoot to kill, and even eat what we kill, problem comes in that pigs breed fast, a lot faster than you can kill 'em with just guns... now we COULD poision them... but that'd poision the horses and the cattle too since they run on the same areas. And just to throw it in there, where there are hog problems, there aren't homeless shelters... people actually work for a living in those areas. When it comes to things like this, it is the Federal government's job to lay down a law that applies to entire nation, then, the states can add on to that in regards to their specific areas. You want to keep a bird, go find you a nest that the mother has abandoned and raise the hatchlings for yourself, you want a squirrel, do the same thing. You want an aquarium, go catch you some crawfish, a couple perch and a couple small mouth bass... that's a nice little set up for ya. (species may vary depending on your area). I do not think that it is ANYONE'S RIGHT to \"own\" an animal that does not belong here. I do not think that it is ANYONE'S RIGHT to hold an animal captive that is meant to be in the wild... call me old fashioned, but if it isn't a dog or a cat or an animal used for sustinance or work, I don't think it should be a pet. And I don't want some jack@$$ thinking he can raise a tiger next to our cattle ranch and the dang thing get loose and kill the cattle and then have to be shot. Some animals ARE NOT MEANT to live in the US. Sugargliders, parakeets, cockatiels, etc are all beautiful animals, and I'm sure they make great \"pets\" for a lot of people, but each one of those, if introduced into the wild and established a population, could drastically and possibly horribly damage the ecosystem around it. There should be better regulation of what comes in and what goes out.",
