        "content": "This was a long time coming. Over the past year, as I have transitioned into civilian life and \u201crepatriated\u201d, as I hadn\u2019t lived in the States for 12 years, I noticed a very unpleasant transformation in American social discourse. There are many factors in that, and I\u2019m not going to bother with them here, as it\u2019s possible that I\u2019d be wasting my time explaining it. Nonetheless, several of those factors have led to a disturbing trend in our society where the ideas of intelligence and objectivity has been both attacked and dismissed, and it\u2019s a basic free-for-all where the loudest and crudest generally rule the day. Not to mention that, instead of looking to elevate one\u2019s consciousness, the idea is to now base the standard on the lowest common denominator. Relating this to military.com, I have noticed that, over the past two years, many of the most well-rounded and informed posters have abandoned the field, if you will, and left it to those who possess neither the experience nor intelligence to engage in rational conversation and debate. Sadly, since the inauguration of the current President, the majority of posters have been so hostile, and presented so much \"information\" that has virtually no basis in fact, that many of the more seasoned posters here do not bother to even show up anymore, as the topics that dominate these message boards have so little fact to anchor them to tangible reality that attempting to discuss or debate them is a fool\u2019s errand. And this leads to the role of the so-called \u201cmoderators\u201d of these message boards. It is generally accepted that the role of a moderator in any discussion is to a) keep all members of a given conversation on topic and b) discourage any behavior that does not promote the focused, civil discussion of a topic. Moderators are also expected to remain objective in their approach to all participants of a discussion/debate. A good number of the moderators fail to do this. Considering that many of the topics now posted here are largely opinion-based (including, sadly, many of the \u201cIn The News\u201d topics), it is virtually impossible to engage in any meaningful discussion. Debating an opinion, in case you didn\u2019t know, is useless, as most of the opinions here have very little basis in fact \u2013 they\u2019re largely emotion-based partisan rants. Secondly, having several moderators look in on a single topic will result in inconsistencies, as there appears to be no uniform approach to doing this job. A moderator cannot both be moderator and participant in a discussion, yet it happens here often. This kind of stuff should have been discouraged long ago, but it continues. With that kind of activity, how can we have confidence in a moderator\u2019s ability to keep things on an even keel (after all, the term moderator in its most basic sense means \u201cone who moderates\u201d or keeps things from going too far one way or the other)? And one of the more comical aspects of this \u201cmoderator\u201d job at military.com is that one cannot publicly criticize one, as though they were beyond reproach. And, how did it come to pass that the so-called \u201cNo CinC bashing\u201d rule was relaxed? For whose benefit was this rule thrown out the window? By allowing all manner of slander against the President of the United States to be posted to this website, you have compromised yourselves and this website in a manner that is no longer acceptable to me. When an entity that claims to be \u201cpro-military\u201d as this one is, and has obviously received permission, and probably even funding, from agencies in the Federal government (namely the DoD and VA), and allows posters to post what they do on this website, it shames the military. Those of us with any real experience in the Armed Forces and understanding of the concept of \u201cgood order and discipline\u201d have found this practice an insult. I don\u2019t give a damn about those who engage in such behavior here, as their conscience is obviously clear enough to be able to do such a thing. Many of those people will whine about their \u201crights\u201d being violated if someone puts the kibosh on such nonsense, but those of us who have respect for proper military traditions and customs are angered that a website that claims to be a service for military members and veterans would allow this. I\u2019ve been very tempted to bring this to the attention of someone who can really put a stop to this, and may still do so. The website Alexa.com monitors traffic on hundreds of websites. It has noted that traffic on the site is dropping (there\u2019s a 10% decrease over the past three months). The message boards were once a popular feature, and one that, to many, is the \u201cface\u201d of military.com. Since the profiles are now almost invisible, it\u2019s a safe bet that many of the uninitiated who visit this website can easily falsely attribute these posts to active members of the military. Do you want that? Do you think the DoD would sanction this if they were truly paying attention? Monster.com could even lose a fairly valuable revenue stream. I do believe that, at one time, they were paid by the DoD to officially manage several career- and transition-oriented resources, and may still receive funding for these services. I personally hold the moderators responsible for allowing the quality of these message boards to degrade to the level where the more thoughtful posters don\u2019t even bother to come out anymore, and the majority of topics posted here are now nothing more than hateful partisan rants offered by a very small number of repeat posters. I could go on and on, but this is no longer worth my time or trouble. Again, I\u2019ve been vacillating over the past several months, but, quite honestly, being put \u201con warning\u201d by a moderator just made it easy. I first thought \"What??\" and then thought about it and asked myself why I'm still here in the first place. I might look in occasionally, but I\u2019m done posting. But I admonish the moderators to get their act together out here, or this website might come to a bad end \u2013 and they\u2019ll have no one but themselves to blame for it, as it\u2019s ultimately you who make these message boards what they are \u2013 not the posters. I'm in no position to communicate any kind of threat to anyone, and don't believe in that, so do not take this as one - just some helpful advice from a person who's been around a few neighborhoods. It would truly be a tragedy to see a website that's been an outstanding information clearinghouse for GIs get dragged down unnecessarily.",

Over the past year, as I have transitioned into civilian life and \u201crepatriated\u201d, as I hadn\u2019t lived in the States for 12 years, I noticed a very unpleasant transformation in American social discourse. There are many factors in that, and I\u2019m not going to bother with them here, as it\u2019s possible that I\u2019d be wasting my time explaining it. Nonetheless, several of those factors have led to a disturbing trend in our society where the ideas of intelligence and objectivity has been both attacked and dismissed, and it\u2019s a basic free-for-all where the loudest and crudest generally rule the day. Not to mention that, instead of looking to elevate one\u2019s consciousness, the idea is to now base the standard on the lowest common denominator. Relating this to military.com, I have noticed that, over the past two years, many of the most well-rounded and informed posters have abandoned the field, if you will, and left it to those who possess neither the experience nor intelligence to engage in rational conversation and debate. Sadly, since the inauguration of the current President, the majority of posters have been so hostile, and presented so much \"information\" that has virtually no basis in fact, that many of the more seasoned posters here do not bother to even show up anymore, as the topics that dominate these message boards have so little fact to anchor them to tangible reality that attempting to discuss or debate them is a fool\u2019s errand. And this leads to the role of the so-called \u201cmoderators\u201d of these message boards. It is generally accepted that the role of a moderator in any discussion is to a) keep all members of a given conversation on topic and b) discourage any behavior that does not promote the focused, civil discussion of a topic. Moderators are also expected to remain objective in their approach to all participants of a discussion/debate. A good number of the moderators fail to do this. Considering that many of the topics now posted here are largely opinion-based (including, sadly, many of the \u201cIn The News\u201d topics), it is virtually impossible to engage in any meaningful discussion. Debating an opinion, in case you didn\u2019t know, is useless, as most of the opinions here have very little basis in fact \u2013 they\u2019re largely emotion-based partisan rants. Secondly, having several moderators look in on a single topic will result in inconsistencies, as there appears to be no uniform approach to doing this job. A moderator cannot both be moderator and participant in a discussion, yet it happens here often. This kind of stuff should have been discouraged long ago, but it continues. With that kind of activity, how can we have confidence in a moderator\u2019s ability to keep things on an even keel (after all, the term moderator in its most basic sense means \u201cone who moderates\u201d or keeps things from going too far one way or the other)? And one of the more comical aspects of this \u201cmoderator\u201d job at military.com is that one cannot publicly criticize one, as though they were beyond reproach. And, how did it come to pass that the so-called \u201cNo CinC bashing\u201d rule was relaxed? For whose benefit was this rule thrown out the window? By allowing all manner of slander against the President of the United States to be posted to this website, you have compromised yourselves and this website in a manner that is no longer acceptable to me. When an entity that claims to be \u201cpro-military\u201d as this one is, and has obviously received permission, and probably even funding, from agencies in the Federal government (namely the DoD and VA), and allows posters to post what they do on this website, it shames the military. Those of us with any real experience in the Armed Forces and understanding of the concept of \u201cgood order and discipline\u201d have found this practice an insult. I don\u2019t give a damn about those who engage in such behavior here, as their conscience is obviously clear enough to be able to do such a thing. Many of those people will whine about their \u201crights\u201d being violated if someone puts the kibosh on such nonsense, but those of us who have respect for proper military traditions and customs are angered that a website that claims to be a service for military members and veterans would allow this. I\u2019ve been very tempted to bring this to the attention of someone who can really put a stop to this, and may still do so. The website Alexa.com monitors traffic on hundreds of websites. It has noted that traffic on the site is dropping (there\u2019s a 10% decrease over the past three months). The message boards were once a popular feature, and one that, to many, is the \u201cface\u201d of military.com. Since the profiles are now almost invisible, it\u2019s a safe bet that many of the uninitiated who visit this website can easily falsely attribute these posts to active members of the military. Do you want that? Do you think the DoD would sanction this if they were truly paying attention? Monster.com could even lose a fairly valuable revenue stream. I do believe that, at one time, they were paid by the DoD to officially manage several career- and transition-oriented resources, and may still receive funding for these services. I personally hold the moderators responsible for allowing the quality of these message boards to degrade to the level where the more thoughtful posters don\u2019t even bother to come out anymore, and the majority of topics posted here are now nothing more than hateful partisan rants offered by a very small number of repeat posters. I could go on and on, but this is no longer worth my time or trouble. Again, I\u2019ve been vacillating over the past several months, but, quite honestly, being put \u201con warning\u201d by a moderator just made it easy. I first thought \"What??\" and then thought about it and asked myself why I'm still here in the first place. I might look in occasionally, but I\u2019m done posting. But I admonish the moderators to get their act together out here, or this website might come to a bad end \u2013 and they\u2019ll have no one but themselves to blame for it, as it\u2019s ultimately you who make these message boards what they are \u2013 not the posters. I'm in no position to communicate any kind of threat to anyone, and don't believe in that, so do not take this as one - just some helpful advice from a person who's been around a few neighborhoods. It would truly be a tragedy to see a website that's been an outstanding information clearinghouse for GIs get dragged down unnecessarily. Why not become a \"Mod\" if you have such a concise clue? I think this site has pretty much abandoned its commitment to military folk, though it retains the name to draw both them and the curious. I got that feeling when the Public Profile Pages got the hack job they went through, then got rendered virtually useless by being relegated to the view of \"Friend Groups\" only - what a !@#%!%@ing waste of time! As for the CinC Bashing Rule, what is bashing? If you start calling anybody filthy names, ya get hammered around here, and should. If you call someone a \"damnable socialist tax and spend idiot!\" because he or she is giving away trillions of my grandkids yet-to-be hard earned money, it that bashing, or just telling the truth?? Taking a hiatus can be good for the Spirit... Adios - - Wandering and Wondering",

You are the only guy that ever got me suspended, a while back when I called you a d-ckh-ad I did not mean it in a mean spirited way, it was meant as two guys just BS'ing around, it got me ten days anyhow. Just wanted to let you know that you will be missed by myself. I understand what you are saying about the mods and I agree with you on that,, imagine that, I agreed with you. Fair winds brother, I wish you all the best This message has been edited. Last edited by: BAGodbehere, Mon 25 May 2009 09:19 AM",

I agree with you that reasoned debate (rather than the endless repetition of mindless talking points) is fading fast. I worry very much that as more and more newspapers are shutdown, fewer and fewer human newswriters will be able to earn a living. Consequently, truth will be in fewer and fewer hands, and emotional talk show hosts and bloggers and columnists will all hold greater sway. All the more so because demonizing the mainstream media has become the norm in conservative circles (that journalists tend to be more liberal than average I do not dispute. Only that they generally stick to objective reporting moreso than your average blogger who is not required to meet any standards of objectivity, who rarely experiences first-hand but merely reflects second-hand, and who often frames things based on the agenda of his own particular blog page.) There is already a tendency in people to hear only what they want to hear, to consider only those viewpoints that fit with \"received wisdom\" of party leaders, to refuse to talk things out, listen to the other side, consider opposing opinions, and THEN if necessary agree to respectfully disagree. Now, the going thing is to demonize the other side as either \"gun-toting racist rednecks\" or \"godless socialist babykillers.\" (DESPITE the fact that both Democrats and Republicans have laid their lives for this country, on battlefields where politics didn't much matter.) And all this emotionalism and reactionism is far too easy in the ever-multiplying channels which permit us anonymity. Too many anonymous authors check their courtesy at the door in favor of cheap thrills and entertainment. I'm not saying everyone does this, by no means, but the ones who do complain the loudest. In short, think for yourself, people. Free your minds from agendas and talking heads of all kinds. This is true freedom, and it is the kind of freedom which even an intelligent inhabitant of your average autocracy or communist country can engage in. (You can imprison the human body, and many a dictator has done that, but it's not always been possible to imprison the human spirit.) ALL THE MORE should the resident of the free Republic for which our fathers shed their blood. ANYTIME you hear a statement consider context, the writer's aims and worldview, who he is addressing, and who he might be speaking for. Trust the first-hand report (whether it be a reporter or a soldier who actually served OVER THERE.) Quit being afraid, we live in GREAT peace and security in this country, and anyone who says different has not patrolled God-forsaken swamp or dodged incoming in a blood-soaked desert, thousands of miles from home. Also we come from hardier stock than should quail at rumors and internet-demagogues. So don't let anyone persuade you by fear, or manipulate your emotions in general. And post like mature thinkers (and I'm not referring here to grammar and spelling), and participate in a way that befits citizens of this great country. Mcgreer, I appreciated your commentary. And thanks all of you for the time you've taken over the past two years to occasionally read my (admittedly long) posts.",
