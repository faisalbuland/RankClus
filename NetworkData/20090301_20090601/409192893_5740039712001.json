More like it could be a quick raise. When it's all said and done, you pay, what, about 14% of your gross income in fed income tax alone? Eliminate that tax, you're giving something like a 15% raise all at once. Great. Wonderful. It eliminates any pressure for Congress to keep trying to catch military pay up the the private sector, eliminates most incentive to do annual 3%+ raises, etc. Or, we can start a movement to repeal the 16th amendment and force the federal government to run using service fees and excise taxes.",
