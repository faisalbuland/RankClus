        "content": "After getting discouraged with the lack of progress on this issue, I resigned myself to pouring money into the money pit I call a car. Upon finding a Shop highly recommended in the community, I spoke with the Tech who started pumping me for info. When he heard the car was not inspected by the Dealer before being put up for sale, and once I bought it it also didn't pass an Inspection (he gave it one free, but I knew it wouldn't pass) he gave me the number of a buddy at the DMV and some paperwork regarding the car's condition and told me to GO to the DMV in person first thing in the A.M. I did, and asked for his buddy, and got more solved in 10 minutes than 5 calls to the DMV Fraud Line had in 2 months!!! This guy got Complaint Forms and a Statement from me, and has a Lieutenant at the Raleigh DMV going to the Dealership in person, to audit their records on my purchase because upon further questioning and digging, the Dealership also botched my Registration!! I was to register my car in my home state, since we're Military, and they instead registered the car FOR ME here in N.C. and sent me a license plate but NO Registration card! The Inspector asked \"Where's your Registration card?!\" and when I told him I never received it, he conveyed a concern that the Dealer registered the car fraudulently. He said to wait for the Lieutenants report on the Dealerships \"cooperation and attitude\" regarding this whole debacle, and if they prove unrepentant, then I should seek Legal recourse in the form of full refund of all monies paid AND pain & suffering using the Soldier in Iraq/Military wife alone aspect. SO, thank you to all who gave great advice! I now feel like I'm being heard and have my drive back. With just over 2 months left til the Hubby comes home, I hope to have this all solved so it doesn't affect his Homecoming. He deserves to NOT have to deal with this junk!",
