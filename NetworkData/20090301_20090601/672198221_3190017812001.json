Never forget that whoever controls the money, controls it all. Note what I've emboldened near the bottom. Associated Press China calls for new global currency By JOE McDONALD , 03.24.09, 12:49 AM EDT China is calling for a new global currency controlled by the International Monetary Fund, stepping up pressure ahead of a London summit of global leaders for changes to a financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar and Western governments. <edit> Zhou Xiaochuan's essay did not mention the dollar by name but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one nation's currency for international payments. In an unusual step, the essay was published in both Chinese and English, making clear it was meant for an international audience. \"The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\" Zhou wrote. A reserve currency is the unit in which a government holds its reserves. But Zhou said the proposed new currency also should be used for trade, investment, pricing commodities and corporate bookkeeping. Beijing has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for the bulk of its trade and to store foreign reserves. Premier Wen Jiabao publicly appealed to Washington this month to avoid any steps in response to the crisis that might erode the value of the dollar and Beijing's estimated $1 trillion holdings in Treasuries and other U.S. government debt. The currency should be based on shares in the IMF held by its 185 member nations, known as special drawing rights, or SDRs, the essay said. The Washington-based IMF advises governments on economic policy and lends money to help with balance-of-payments problems. Independent economists have suggested creating a new reserve currency to reduce reliance on the dollar but acknowledge that would face obstacles. It would need acceptance from governments that have relied on the dollar for decades and hold huge stockpiles of U.S. currency. China has pressed for changes to give developing countries more influence in the IMF, the World Bank and other finance bodies. G20 finance officials issued a statement at their last meeting calling for such changes but gave no details of how that might happen. Russia also has called for such reforms and says it will press its case at the London summit. Zhou said the new currency would let governments manage their economies more efficiently because its value would not be influenced by any one nation's need to regulate its own finance and trade. \"A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity,\" Zhou wrote. \"This will significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\" <edit> 'http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/03/24/ap6203036.html'",

The purpose of the meeting was to update members on local activities and to hear appeals for NP support from four potential political candidates. The NP is being very active in organization building and politics. There are 300 members in Chicago. In order to build an organizational and financial base the NP is sponsoring house parties. Locally it has been successful both fiscally and in building a grassroots base. Nationwide it has resulted in 1000 people committed to monthly contributions. The NP's political strategy is to support progressive candidates in elections only if they have a concrete chance to \"win\". This has resulted in a winning ratio of 77 of 110 elections. Candidates must be approved via a NP political committee. Once approved, candidates must sign a contract with the NP. The contract mandates that they must have a visible and active relationship with the NP. The political entourage included Alderman Michael Chandler, William Delgado, chief of staff for State Rep Miguel del Valle, and spokespersons for State Sen. Alice Palmer, Sonya Sanchez, chief of staff for State Sen. Jesse Garcia, who is running for State Rep in Garcia's District; and Barack Obama, chief of staff for State Sen. Alice Palmer.

Although ACORN and SEIU Local 880 were the harbingers of the NP there was a strong presence of CoC and DSA (15% DSA). Moreover a good 8% were younger Generation X'ers who are critically needed. A more diverse representation of Labor is missing. Secondly, the NP is taking \"action.\" Four political candidates were \"there\" seeking NP support. The NP is strategically organizing via house parties and tactically entering only elections that they can win.

Google that puppy up one time and read what 100s of economists are saying about this stuff... A single global currency would be a huge political blunder - who controls a single world currency when you have close to 200 nations with their own separate survival motions and therefore different ideas on how to spend their money? Such a thing would be the cause of another great war that would likely finish us off. I believe Geithner's main problem is his pedigree. It's impressive, certainly, but he has never spent time in the weeds, and has only seen monetary and financial policy from the upper strategic levels. I don't think he's grasping how policy truly affects people among the middle and lower classes. At first blush, his rescue plan looks too much like the stuff he and Paulson did several months ago, and even worse - when I read about it, I feel like I'm reading about AIG peddling credit default swaps. I'm not as smart as Geithner in this realm, for sure, and there are likely a lot of other things that are going on that I can't understand - but now, for the first time, I'm concerned. And that has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats or Obama Bush or Geithner or Congress or whoever - the seriousness of our problem is really starting to show. Hunker down - I think we're going to have a really hot summer.",

This country will NOT be socialist without a serious fight! Sound crazy - watch what happens as the truth and reality of their plans start hitting the American people. This debt dwarfs social security, medicare, and medicaid, COMBINED. This 9-Trillion Dollar debt is ACTUALLY 56-TRILLION DOLLARS by NORMAL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING guidelines. Some are saying we cannot even pay the \"interest\" payments on a nut that size - in ONLY FIVE YEARS... what happens when China & Russia - then Europe push to get a GLOBAL currency - WE GO BANKRUPT - that means a 15-20k Toyota will sell for 120k \"US-DOLLARS\"... that's called the Peso-Dollar... Google that puppy up one time and read what 100s of economists are saying about this stuff...", 
        "reply": " A single global currency would be a huge political blunder - who controls a single world currency when you have close to 200 nations with their own separate survival motions and therefore different ideas on how to spend their money? Such a thing would be the cause of another great war that would likely finish us off. I believe Geithner's main problem is his pedigree. It's impressive, certainly, but he has never spent time in the weeds, and has only seen monetary and financial policy from the upper strategic levels. I don't think he's grasping how policy truly affects people among the middle and lower classes. At first blush, his rescue plan looks too much like the stuff he and Paulson did several months ago, and even worse - when I read about it, I feel like I'm reading about AIG peddling credit default swaps. I'm not as smart as Geithner in this realm, for sure, and there are likely a lot of other things that are going on that I can't understand - but now, for the first time, I'm concerned. And that has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats or Obama Bush or Geithner or Congress or whoever - the seriousness of our problem is really starting to show.

Associated Press China calls for new global currency By JOE McDONALD , 03.24.09, 12:49 AM EDT China is calling for a new global currency controlled by the International Monetary Fund, stepping up pressure ahead of a London summit of global leaders for changes to a financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar and Western governments. <edit> Zhou Xiaochuan's essay did not mention the dollar by name but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one nation's currency for international payments. In an unusual step, the essay was published in both Chinese and English, making clear it was meant for an international audience. \"The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\" Zhou wrote. A reserve currency is the unit in which a government holds its reserves. But Zhou said the proposed new currency also should be used for trade, investment, pricing commodities and corporate bookkeeping. Beijing has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for the bulk of its trade and to store foreign reserves. Premier Wen Jiabao publicly appealed to Washington this month to avoid any steps in response to the crisis that might erode the value of the dollar and Beijing's estimated $1 trillion holdings in Treasuries and other U.S. government debt. The currency should be based on shares in the IMF held by its 185 member nations, known as special drawing rights, or SDRs, the essay said. The Washington-based IMF advises governments on economic policy and lends money to help with balance-of-payments problems. Independent economists have suggested creating a new reserve currency to reduce reliance on the dollar but acknowledge that would face obstacles. It would need acceptance from governments that have relied on the dollar for decades and hold huge stockpiles of U.S. currency. China has pressed for changes to give developing countries more influence in the IMF, the World Bank and other finance bodies. G20 finance officials issued a statement at their last meeting calling for such changes but gave no details of how that might happen. Russia also has called for such reforms and says it will press its case at the London summit. Zhou said the new currency would let governments manage their economies more efficiently because its value would not be influenced by any one nation's need to regulate its own finance and trade. \"A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity,\" Zhou wrote. \"This will significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\" <edit> 'http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/03/24/ap6203036.html' This leads to one very important question...

The purpose of the meeting was to update members on local activities and to hear appeals for NP support from four potential political candidates. The NP is being very active in organization building and politics. There are 300 members in Chicago. In order to build an organizational and financial base the NP is sponsoring house parties. Locally it has been successful both fiscally and in building a grassroots base. Nationwide it has resulted in 1000 people committed to monthly contributions. The NP's political strategy is to support progressive candidates in elections only if they have a concrete chance to \"win\". This has resulted in a winning ratio of 77 of 110 elections. Candidates must be approved via a NP political committee. Once approved, candidates must sign a contract with the NP. The contract mandates that they must have a visible and active relationship with the NP. The political entourage included Alderman Michael Chandler, William Delgado, chief of staff for State Rep Miguel del Valle, and spokespersons for State Sen. Alice Palmer, Sonya Sanchez, chief of staff for State Sen. Jesse Garcia, who is running for State Rep in Garcia's District; and Barack Obama, chief of staff for State Sen. Alice Palmer. Obama is running for Palmer's vacant seat\u2026.\u201d ..but here\u2019s some encouraging news that our new president was PROMOTING\u2026 \u201c\u2026Indeed it was an exciting evening because the NP has two crucial components. First, the NP is a true \"Rainbow Coalition\" consisting of both young and aged African-Americans, Hispanics and Caucasians. Although ACORN and SEIU Local 880 were the harbingers of the NP there was a strong presence of CoC and DSA (15% DSA). Moreover a good 8% were younger Generation X'ers who are critically needed. A more diverse representation of Labor is missing. Secondly, the NP is taking \"action.\" Four political candidates were \"there\" seeking NP support. The NP is strategically organizing via house parties and tactically entering only elections that they can win. Furthermore they are organizing a campaign on the \"Living Wage Ordinance\" in the Chicago City Council. ---end snip--- \u2026but ya know, maybe he was just trying to keep on eye the competition\u2026?

The Democratic Socialists of America Present \u201cThe First Chicago Town Meeting on Economic Insecurity\u2026\u201d \u2026MICHAEL DAWSON, Professor of Political Science, University of Chicago BARACK OBAMA, Candidate, State Senate, 13th Legislative District TONI PRECKWINKLE, 4th Ward Alderman JOSEPH SCHWARTZ, Professor of Political Science, Temple University SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 25TH 7:00pm Ida Noyes Hall, Cloyster Club 1313 E. 59th Street, Chicago Sponsored by: *University of Chicago Democrats *Chicago Democratic Socialists of America *University of Chicago Democratic Socialists of America For more information call: University of Chicago Democratic Socialists, 312-955-6371 Constitution and By-Laws of the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America ARTICLE I NAME, TERRITORY, OFFICE Section 1 Name[/b] The Name of this organization is the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America, Inc., an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, hereinafter referred to as \"CDSA\" or \"The Corporation.\" Section 2 Territory The Corporation shall conduct activities in the greater Chicago area within the territory defined by the charter granted by the national Democratic Socialists of America to the Chicago Local DSA. Section 3 Office The principal office of The Corporation shall be in Chicago, Illinois. This office shall direct CDSA activities and be the repository for all CDSA records. ARTICLE II PURPOSE The purpose of The Corporation shall be to organize the activities of the members of the Democratic Socialists of America. Its activities shall include education and advocacy. We share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. ---end snip--- Gee \u2013 I wonder if ole Plumber Joe really knew he was right or if he was only kidding\u2026 Oh, please. Do you REALLY think the Neo-Con's are totally blameless in all this and it's all Obama and his fellow travelers? I'd suggest you look at WHEN the depression started for clue. You might also consider that since the election, the slander-machine directed at the current President has not missed a beat and the character assassination goes on un-abated. So does the fear mongering, which a lot people right here on these boards are falling for (see: guns). Why do think that is? Because he's one of them? Would you even consider the idea that maybe...just maybe, they're afraid of him; afraid he'll derail the New World Order? No one is placing blame on one party, well, at least I'm not... The point is, the problem that we face is many faceted and multi generational... I feel that some \"astute\" politicians, if there is such a thing, are taking advantage of the current U.S. and global situation, to put forth, for lack of a better term, an agenda of their making... Just the way that there were those that attempted a coup d'etat during the 1930s, such are those now, attempting another... This is the time for all citizens to be vigilant and to voice their questions, loudly and most vociferously... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

A more diverse representation of Labor is missing. Secondly, the NP is taking \"action.\" Four political candidates were \"there\" seeking NP support. The NP is strategically organizing via house parties and tactically entering only elections that they can win. Furthermore they are organizing a campaign on the \"Living Wage Ordinance\" in the Chicago City Council. ---end snip--- \u2026but ya know, maybe he was just trying to keep on eye the competition\u2026?

Do you REALLY think the Neo-Con's are totally blameless in all this and it's all Obama and his fellow travelers? I'd suggest you look at WHEN the depression started for clue. You might also consider that since the election, the slander-machine directed at the current President has not missed a beat and the character assassination goes on un-abated. So does the fear mongering, which a lot people right here on these boards are falling for (see: guns). Why do think that is? Because he's one of them? Would you even consider the idea that maybe...just maybe, they're afraid of him; afraid he'll derail the New World Order?", 
        "reply": " No one is placing blame on one party, well, at least I'm not... The point is, the problem that we face is many faceted and multi generational... I feel that some \"astute\" politicians, if there is such a thing, are taking advantage of the current U.S. and global situation, to put forth, for lack of a better term, an agenda of their making... Just the way that there were those that attempted a coup d'etat during the 1930s, such are those now, attempting another... This is the time for all citizens to be vigilant and to voice their questions, loudly and most vociferously... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

Associated Press China calls for new global currency By JOE McDONALD , 03.24.09, 12:49 AM EDT China is calling for a new global currency controlled by the International Monetary Fund, stepping up pressure ahead of a London summit of global leaders for changes to a financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar and Western governments. <edit> Zhou Xiaochuan's essay did not mention the dollar by name but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one nation's currency for international payments. In an unusual step, the essay was published in both Chinese and English, making clear it was meant for an international audience. \"The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\" Zhou wrote. A reserve currency is the unit in which a government holds its reserves. But Zhou said the proposed new currency also should be used for trade, investment, pricing commodities and corporate bookkeeping. Beijing has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for the bulk of its trade and to store foreign reserves. Premier Wen Jiabao publicly appealed to Washington this month to avoid any steps in response to the crisis that might erode the value of the dollar and Beijing's estimated $1 trillion holdings in Treasuries and other U.S. government debt. The currency should be based on shares in the IMF held by its 185 member nations, known as special drawing rights, or SDRs, the essay said. The Washington-based IMF advises governments on economic policy and lends money to help with balance-of-payments problems. Independent economists have suggested creating a new reserve currency to reduce reliance on the dollar but acknowledge that would face obstacles. It would need acceptance from governments that have relied on the dollar for decades and hold huge stockpiles of U.S. currency. China has pressed for changes to give developing countries more influence in the IMF, the World Bank and other finance bodies. G20 finance officials issued a statement at their last meeting calling for such changes but gave no details of how that might happen. Russia also has called for such reforms and says it will press its case at the London summit. Zhou said the new currency would let governments manage their economies more efficiently because its value would not be influenced by any one nation's need to regulate its own finance and trade. \"A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity,\" Zhou wrote. \"This will significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\" <edit> 'http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/03/24/ap6203036.html' This leads to one very important question...

Associated Press China calls for new global currency By JOE McDONALD , 03.24.09, 12:49 AM EDT China is calling for a new global currency controlled by the International Monetary Fund, stepping up pressure ahead of a London summit of global leaders for changes to a financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar and Western governments. <edit> Zhou Xiaochuan's essay did not mention the dollar by name but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one nation's currency for international payments. In an unusual step, the essay was published in both Chinese and English, making clear it was meant for an international audience. \"The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\" Zhou wrote. A reserve currency is the unit in which a government holds its reserves. But Zhou said the proposed new currency also should be used for trade, investment, pricing commodities and corporate bookkeeping. Beijing has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for the bulk of its trade and to store foreign reserves. Premier Wen Jiabao publicly appealed to Washington this month to avoid any steps in response to the crisis that might erode the value of the dollar and Beijing's estimated $1 trillion holdings in Treasuries and other U.S. government debt. The currency should be based on shares in the IMF held by its 185 member nations, known as special drawing rights, or SDRs, the essay said. The Washington-based IMF advises governments on economic policy and lends money to help with balance-of-payments problems. Independent economists have suggested creating a new reserve currency to reduce reliance on the dollar but acknowledge that would face obstacles. It would need acceptance from governments that have relied on the dollar for decades and hold huge stockpiles of U.S. currency. China has pressed for changes to give developing countries more influence in the IMF, the World Bank and other finance bodies. G20 finance officials issued a statement at their last meeting calling for such changes but gave no details of how that might happen. Russia also has called for such reforms and says it will press its case at the London summit. Zhou said the new currency would let governments manage their economies more efficiently because its value would not be influenced by any one nation's need to regulate its own finance and trade. \"A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity,\" Zhou wrote. \"This will significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\" <edit> 'http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/03/24/ap6203036.html'",

The purpose of the meeting was to update members on local activities and to hear appeals for NP support from four potential political candidates. The NP is being very active in organization building and politics. There are 300 members in Chicago. In order to build an organizational and financial base the NP is sponsoring house parties. Locally it has been successful both fiscally and in building a grassroots base. Nationwide it has resulted in 1000 people committed to monthly contributions. The NP's political strategy is to support progressive candidates in elections only if they have a concrete chance to \"win\". This has resulted in a winning ratio of 77 of 110 elections. Candidates must be approved via a NP political committee. Once approved, candidates must sign a contract with the NP. The contract mandates that they must have a visible and active relationship with the NP. The political entourage included Alderman Michael Chandler, William Delgado, chief of staff for State Rep Miguel del Valle, and spokespersons for State Sen.

You might also consider that since the election, the slander-machine directed at the current President has not missed a beat and the character assassination goes on un-abated. So does the fear mongering, which a lot people right here on these boards are falling for (see: guns). Why do think that is? Because he's one of them?

Do you really think those were just regular people who happened to get mad and suddenly come up with great idea and take a bus trip to protest\u2026 THOSE WERE UNION ORGANIZED! THOSE WERE the Socialist Democratic Party giving their boss a little help \u2013 why do you think Obama and Dodd received the BIGGEST donations from AIG during the campaign\u2026? Do you honestly believe he\u2019s not lying out his freaking butt about KNOWING those bonuses were being paid out? HE KNEW ABOUT IT! This TRILLION dollar deficit has ONE GOAL!

Afraid - no not afraid of him - afraid that they are so blindly bend on their socialist agenda, they think they can simply cram it down our throats - gag us with SO MUCH DEBT that capitalism will never survive... This country will NOT be socialist without a serious fight! Sound crazy - watch what happens as the truth and reality of their plans start hitting the American people. This debt dwarfs social security, medicare, and medicaid, COMBINED. This 9-Trillion Dollar debt is ACTUALLY 56-TRILLION DOLLARS by NORMAL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING guidelines. Some are saying we cannot even pay the \"interest\" payments on a nut that size - in ONLY FIVE YEARS... what happens when China & Russia - then Europe push to get a GLOBAL currency - WE GO BANKRUPT - that means a 15-20k Toyota will sell for 120k \"US-DOLLARS\"... that's called the Peso-Dollar...

Do you REALLY think the Neo-Con's are totally blameless in all this and it's all Obama and his fellow travelers? I'd suggest you look at WHEN the depression started for clue. You might also consider that since the election, the slander-machine directed at the current President has not missed a beat and the character assassination goes on un-abated. So does the fear mongering, which a lot people right here on these boards are falling for (see: guns). Why do think that is? Because he's one of them? Would you even consider the idea that maybe...just maybe, they're afraid of him; afraid he'll derail the New World Order? Hi Kit, What part of my post implies that the useless weasel republican-posers deserve to keep their seats\u2026? As far as I\u2019m concerned the entire bunch \u2013 with the exception of ONLY a very few \u2013 should be thrown out of office. As for slander machine\u2026 Obama has his networks \u2013 MSNBC \u2013 CNN \u2013 etc \u2013 ALL bow worship at the alter \u2013 and if don\u2019t think so then where is the outrage that little Skippy (Geithner) was part of the AIG scam months ago? Isn\u2019t it a bit ironic that this guy is either incompetent \u2013 and he simply FORGOT to pay his taxes \u2013 WHICH (btw) his company \u201cALSO\u201d reimbursed him for \u2013 which means he not only did NOT pay his taxes \u2013 he STOLE the money they PAID him to PAY his taxes with \u2013 He didn\u2019t PAY those taxes \u2013 then DID NOT even claim the money he was PAID to PAY the taxes with\u2026 but golly-gee he forgot\u2026 He forgot about those bonuses for AIG too, right\u2026? Should we even talk about the Lobbyists he swore to have in his cabinet\u2026? What about all those who\u2019ve already resigned or withdrew because they might have some baggage they can\u2019t quite stuff in the closet deep enough\u2026? Slander Machine \u2013 Obama has had a FREE TICKET thus far\u2026 His interview on 60-minutes was stupidly disingenuous \u2013 he looked \u201cstoned\u201d to me\u2026 my wife even said the same thing \u2013 he looked like he had nice buzz-on\u2026 New World Order \u2013 Kit \u2013 come-on THAT is what the socialist Democrats are TRYING TO DO! Why else would the democrats be meeting with the socialist parties from Europe\u2026? Let me ask you something \u2013 all those \u201cBUS\u201d trips to protest in front of AIG\u2019s executives houses, WHO do you think is organizing that puppy\u2026? Do you really think those were just regular people who happened to get mad and suddenly come up with great idea and take a bus trip to protest\u2026 THOSE WERE UNION ORGANIZED! THOSE WERE the Socialist Democratic Party giving their boss a little help \u2013 why do you think Obama and Dodd received the BIGGEST donations from AIG during the campaign\u2026? Do you honestly believe he\u2019s not lying out his freaking butt about KNOWING those bonuses were being paid out? HE KNEW ABOUT IT! This TRILLION dollar deficit has ONE GOAL! And it has NOTHING to do with the welfare of this country! Afraid - no not afraid of him - afraid that they are so blindly bend on their socialist agenda, they think they can simply cram it down our throats - gag us with SO MUCH DEBT that capitalism will never survive... This country will NOT be socialist without a serious fight! Sound crazy - watch what happens as the truth and reality of their plans start hitting the American people. This debt dwarfs social security, medicare, and medicaid, COMBINED. This 9-Trillion Dollar debt is ACTUALLY 56-TRILLION DOLLARS by NORMAL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING guidelines. Some are saying we cannot even pay the \"interest\" payments on a nut that size - in ONLY FIVE YEARS... what happens when China & Russia - then Europe push to get a GLOBAL currency - WE GO BANKRUPT - that means a 15-20k Toyota will sell for 120k \"US-DOLLARS\"... that's called the Peso-Dollar...

Associated Press China calls for new global currency By JOE McDONALD , 03.24.09, 12:49 AM EDT China is calling for a new global currency controlled by the International Monetary Fund, stepping up pressure ahead of a London summit of global leaders for changes to a financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar and Western governments. <edit> Zhou Xiaochuan's essay did not mention the dollar by name but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one nation's currency for international payments. In an unusual step, the essay was published in both Chinese and English, making clear it was meant for an international audience. \"The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\" Zhou wrote. A reserve currency is the unit in which a government holds its reserves. But Zhou said the proposed new currency also should be used for trade, investment, pricing commodities and corporate bookkeeping. Beijing has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for the bulk of its trade and to store foreign reserves. Premier Wen Jiabao publicly appealed to Washington this month to avoid any steps in response to the crisis that might erode the value of the dollar and Beijing's estimated $1 trillion holdings in Treasuries and other U.S. government debt. The currency should be based on shares in the IMF held by its 185 member nations, known as special drawing rights, or SDRs, the essay said. The Washington-based IMF advises governments on economic policy and lends money to help with balance-of-payments problems. Independent economists have suggested creating a new reserve currency to reduce reliance on the dollar but acknowledge that would face obstacles. It would need acceptance from governments that have relied on the dollar for decades and hold huge stockpiles of U.S. currency. China has pressed for changes to give developing countries more influence in the IMF, the World Bank and other finance bodies. G20 finance officials issued a statement at their last meeting calling for such changes but gave no details of how that might happen. Russia also has called for such reforms and says it will press its case at the London summit. Zhou said the new currency would let governments manage their economies more efficiently because its value would not be influenced by any one nation's need to regulate its own finance and trade. \"A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity,\" Zhou wrote. \"This will significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\" <edit> 'http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/03/24/ap6203036.html' This leads to one very important question...

I wonder if Obama still has his membership card? Some Basic Facts About Chicago DSA Chicago DSA is affiliated with the national Democratic Socialists of America but is separately incorporated. Anyone paying national membership dues in the Chicago area is automatically a member of the Chicago DSA local. Chicago DSA is incorporated as an Illinois non-profit corporation and, like DSA nationally, has 501c4 status from the IRS. This means we are tax exempt but contributions are not tax deductible. It also means our electoral participation is limited in much the same way as participation by labor unions is limited. Chicago DSA covers Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties: basically zip codes 600 through 609. Our experience has been that this is far too large a territory for members to effectively participate through chapter-wide general membership meetings; consequently, we encourage the formation of branches and commissions. If there are none in your geographic area or in your area of interest, consider taking the initiative in forming one. The members of the Executive Committee would be glad to help. Here\u2019s a little snip right the socialist \u201cNew Party\u201d thanking Obama for his support\u2026 ---snip--- Chicago New Party Update by Bruce Bentley \u201c\u2026About 50 activists attended the Chicago New Party membership meeting in July. The purpose of the meeting was to update members on local activities and to hear appeals for NP support from four potential political candidates. The NP is being very active in organization building and politics. There are 300 members in Chicago. In order to build an organizational and financial base the NP is sponsoring house parties. Locally it has been successful both fiscally and in building a grassroots base. Nationwide it has resulted in 1000 people committed to monthly contributions. The NP's political strategy is to support progressive candidates in elections only if they have a concrete chance to \"win\". This has resulted in a winning ratio of 77 of 110 elections. Candidates must be approved via a NP political committee. Once approved, candidates must sign a contract with the NP. The contract mandates that they must have a visible and active relationship with the NP. The political entourage included Alderman Michael Chandler, William Delgado, chief of staff for State Rep Miguel del Valle, and spokespersons for State Sen. Alice Palmer, Sonya Sanchez, chief of staff for State Sen. Jesse Garcia, who is running for State Rep in Garcia's District; and Barack Obama, chief of staff for State Sen. Alice Palmer. Obama is running for Palmer's vacant seat\u2026.\u201d ..but here\u2019s some encouraging news that our new president was PROMOTING\u2026 \u201c\u2026Indeed it was an exciting evening because the NP has two crucial components. First, the NP is a true \"Rainbow Coalition\" consisting of both young and aged African-Americans, Hispanics and Caucasians. Although ACORN and SEIU Local 880 were the harbingers of the NP there was a strong presence of CoC and DSA (15% DSA). Moreover a good 8% were younger Generation X'ers who are critically needed. A more diverse representation of Labor is missing. Secondly, the NP is taking \"action.\" Four political candidates were \"there\" seeking NP support. The NP is strategically organizing via house parties and tactically entering only elections that they can win. Furthermore they are organizing a campaign on the \"Living Wage Ordinance\" in the Chicago City Council. ---end snip--- \u2026but ya know, maybe he was just trying to keep on eye the competition\u2026?

Do you REALLY think the Neo-Con's are totally blameless in all this and it's all Obama and his fellow travelers? I'd suggest you look at WHEN the depression started for clue. You might also consider that since the election, the slander-machine directed at the current President has not missed a beat and the character assassination goes on un-abated. So does the fear mongering, which a lot people right here on these boards are falling for (see: guns). Why do think that is? Because he's one of them? Would you even consider the idea that maybe...just maybe, they're afraid of him; afraid he'll derail the New World Order? No one is placing blame on one party, well, at least I'm not... The point is, the problem that we face is many faceted and multi generational... I feel that some \"astute\" politicians, if there is such a thing, are taking advantage of the current U.S. and global situation, to put forth, for lack of a better term, an agenda of their making... Just the way that there were those that attempted a coup d'etat during the 1930s, such are those now, attempting another... This is the time for all citizens to be vigilant and to voice their questions, loudly and most vociferously... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",

I wonder if Obama still has his membership card? Some Basic Facts About Chicago DSA Chicago DSA is affiliated with the national Democratic Socialists of America but is separately incorporated. Anyone paying national membership dues in the Chicago area is automatically a member of the Chicago DSA local. Chicago DSA is incorporated as an Illinois non-profit corporation and, like DSA nationally, has 501c4 status from the IRS. This means we are tax exempt but contributions are not tax deductible. It also means our electoral participation is limited in much the same way as participation by labor unions is limited. Chicago DSA covers Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties: basically zip codes 600 through 609. Our experience has been that this is far too large a territory for members to effectively participate through chapter-wide general membership meetings; consequently, we encourage the formation of branches and commissions. If there are none in your geographic area or in your area of interest, consider taking the initiative in forming one. The members of the Executive Committee would be glad to help. Here\u2019s a little snip right the socialist \u201cNew Party\u201d thanking Obama for his support\u2026 ---snip--- Chicago New Party Update by Bruce Bentley \u201c\u2026About 50 activists attended the Chicago New Party membership meeting in July. The purpose of the meeting was to update members on local activities and to hear appeals for NP support from four potential political candidates. The NP is being very active in organization building and politics. There are 300 members in Chicago. In order to build an organizational and financial base the NP is sponsoring house parties. Locally it has been successful both fiscally and in building a grassroots base. Nationwide it has resulted in 1000 people committed to monthly contributions. The NP's political strategy is to support progressive candidates in elections only if they have a concrete chance to \"win\". This has resulted in a winning ratio of 77 of 110 elections. Candidates must be approved via a NP political committee. Once approved, candidates must sign a contract with the NP. The contract mandates that they must have a visible and active relationship with the NP. The political entourage included Alderman Michael Chandler, William Delgado, chief of staff for State Rep Miguel del Valle, and spokespersons for State Sen. Alice Palmer, Sonya Sanchez, chief of staff for State Sen. Jesse Garcia, who is running for State Rep in Garcia's District; and Barack Obama, chief of staff for State Sen. Alice Palmer. Obama is running for Palmer's vacant seat\u2026.\u201d ..but here\u2019s some encouraging news that our new president was PROMOTING\u2026 \u201c\u2026Indeed it was an exciting evening because the NP has two crucial components. First, the NP is a true \"Rainbow Coalition\" consisting of both young and aged African-Americans, Hispanics and Caucasians. Although ACORN and SEIU Local 880 were the harbingers of the NP there was a strong presence of CoC and DSA (15% DSA). Moreover a good 8% were younger Generation X'ers who are critically needed. A more diverse representation of Labor is missing. Secondly, the NP is taking \"action.\" Four political candidates were \"there\" seeking NP support. The NP is strategically organizing via house parties and tactically entering only elections that they can win. Furthermore they are organizing a campaign on the \"Living Wage Ordinance\" in the Chicago City Council. ---end snip--- \u2026but ya know, maybe he was just trying to keep on eye the competition\u2026?

Associated Press China calls for new global currency By JOE McDONALD , 03.24.09, 12:49 AM EDT China is calling for a new global currency controlled by the International Monetary Fund, stepping up pressure ahead of a London summit of global leaders for changes to a financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar and Western governments. <edit> Zhou Xiaochuan's essay did not mention the dollar by name but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one nation's currency for international payments. In an unusual step, the essay was published in both Chinese and English, making clear it was meant for an international audience. \"The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\" Zhou wrote. A reserve currency is the unit in which a government holds its reserves. But Zhou said the proposed new currency also should be used for trade, investment, pricing commodities and corporate bookkeeping. Beijing has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for the bulk of its trade and to store foreign reserves. Premier Wen Jiabao publicly appealed to Washington this month to avoid any steps in response to the crisis that might erode the value of the dollar and Beijing's estimated $1 trillion holdings in Treasuries and other U.S. government debt. The currency should be based on shares in the IMF held by its 185 member nations, known as special drawing rights, or SDRs, the essay said. The Washington-based IMF advises governments on economic policy and lends money to help with balance-of-payments problems. Independent economists have suggested creating a new reserve currency to reduce reliance on the dollar but acknowledge that would face obstacles. It would need acceptance from governments that have relied on the dollar for decades and hold huge stockpiles of U.S. currency. China has pressed for changes to give developing countries more influence in the IMF, the World Bank and other finance bodies. G20 finance officials issued a statement at their last meeting calling for such changes but gave no details of how that might happen. Russia also has called for such reforms and says it will press its case at the London summit. Zhou said the new currency would let governments manage their economies more efficiently because its value would not be influenced by any one nation's need to regulate its own finance and trade. \"A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity,\" Zhou wrote. \"This will significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\" <edit> 'http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/03/24/ap6203036.html' This leads to one very important question...

The world goverment crowd has been wanting this for years and now the time is \"right\" to implement it. Never forget that whoever controls the money, controls it all. Note what I've emboldened near the bottom. Associated Press China calls for new global currency By JOE McDONALD , 03.24.09, 12:49 AM EDT China is calling for a new global currency controlled by the International Monetary Fund, stepping up pressure ahead of a London summit of global leaders for changes to a financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar and Western governments. <edit> Zhou Xiaochuan's essay did not mention the dollar by name but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one nation's currency for international payments. In an unusual step, the essay was published in both Chinese and English, making clear it was meant for an international audience. \"The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency,\" Zhou wrote. A reserve currency is the unit in which a government holds its reserves. But Zhou said the proposed new currency also should be used for trade, investment, pricing commodities and corporate bookkeeping. Beijing has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for the bulk of its trade and to store foreign reserves. Premier Wen Jiabao publicly appealed to Washington this month to avoid any steps in response to the crisis that might erode the value of the dollar and Beijing's estimated $1 trillion holdings in Treasuries and other U.S. government debt. The currency should be based on shares in the IMF held by its 185 member nations, known as special drawing rights, or SDRs, the essay said. The Washington-based IMF advises governments on economic policy and lends money to help with balance-of-payments problems. Independent economists have suggested creating a new reserve currency to reduce reliance on the dollar but acknowledge that would face obstacles. It would need acceptance from governments that have relied on the dollar for decades and hold huge stockpiles of U.S. currency. China has pressed for changes to give developing countries more influence in the IMF, the World Bank and other finance bodies. G20 finance officials issued a statement at their last meeting calling for such changes but gave no details of how that might happen. Russia also has called for such reforms and says it will press its case at the London summit. Zhou said the new currency would let governments manage their economies more efficiently because its value would not be influenced by any one nation's need to regulate its own finance and trade. \"A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity,\" Zhou wrote. \"This will significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability.\" <edit> 'http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/03/24/ap6203036.html' This leads to one very important question... Since the PRC is proposing this and that they feel that the U.S. dollar in in danger of being devalued by hyper inflation, how long before they decide to \"dump\" their ONE TRILLION DOLLARS, in bonds, notes and securities and cut their losses, thus causing the U.S. dollar to fail?... One wonders... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 They can't afford to let the US dollar fail so long as it and T-bills are the preeminent sovereign financial instruments on the planet - and they know it. They're looking for a way out of their problem, which is too much of our debt, which can explode on them any day, and dependence on our consumer base, which is shrinking.", 
        "reply": " The actual true currency on the world market, is not monetary, it is the trade in energy, i.e. crude oil, coal and refined petroleum product... Right now, the U.S. dollar is the unit of that trade... If this were not so, why then was Saddam Hussein actually brought down?... He was in the act of changing the accepted unit of petro trade in the mid east from the U.S. dollar to the Euro, thus ending the reason for any nation, i.e. China, to prop up the U.S. dollar and thus causing total economic collapse of the U.S.... WMD was the excuse, collapse of the U.S. economy was the reason... No, not for oil but, for the saving of the U.S. economy... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
