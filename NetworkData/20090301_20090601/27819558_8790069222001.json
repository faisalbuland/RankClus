Perhaps you're not fully aware of the difficulties of Mormons who moved to Utah for the specific reason of having multiple wives? Or, that following our war between the states & World War I it was common practice for older men to take very young brides in order to insure they'd benefit from government benefits....some of which gays seem to want for themselves? \"http://www.rickross.com/reference/polygamy/polygamy5.html",

They have compounds because they want to keep their people in a bubble away from the outside world, and avoid intrusions into their secretive world by those living near the compound. The bubble is an excellent way to control people and it removes the ability for the followers to make other choices. When you have people raised in such compounds, their belief system becomes hard wired and then you have willing participants who will abide by such notions as arranged marriages, child brides, and incest.

In order for the question to \"remain\", you'd have to of asked it before (scratching head). You want me to give an answer to a hypothetical question concerning a scenario that doesn't exist. Now why would you want me to answer such a question when we already have proof that your slippery slope scenario just isn't materializing. If an when a group of people come forward and request multiple marriages be legalized, then you can get back with me and I'll review the circumstances and give my input. Until then, your just supporting strawman theories created to scare people into believing Gay marriage equality will bring about a slippery slope scenario, which by the way, is year after year being proved false by States such as Massachusetts. Sorry, I thought you had seen my unanswered question, asked on 12 May in response to ReconTeam, i.e. why not other forms of marriage as well? Can we count on your enthusiastic support for ALL 'marriages?' No, it ain't ME trying to scare other people; but, when the polygamists in Utah petition for their 'rights' too....will YOU be there for them? Polygamist do not want to be recognized as Married, they enjoy the financial windfall of their women collecting those sizable government benefits known as Welfare, Food Stamps, Medicaid, WIC, etc. Those clergy style arranged couplings where an old geezer gets a underage teenage bride is illegal - which further promotes their desire to avoid marriage. You won't be seeing the Polygamist groups raising their hands and asking for the Right to marry multiple wives, it would be a financial disaster to them. Go to link below for more info on these moochers. ________________________________________________________________________ LOL....\"moochers\" you say? Just because they wish to enjoy the benefits provided by our government, i.e. some of which seem to be the very reason gays wish to marry? My, my....aren't we selective about WHO should benefit and who should not. Perhaps you're not fully aware of the difficulties of Mormons who moved to Utah for the specific reason of having multiple wives? Or, that following our war between the states & World War I it was common practice for older men to take very young brides in order to insure they'd benefit from government benefits....some of which gays seem to want for themselves? \"http://www.rickross.com/reference/polygamy/polygamy5.html Hummm, but gays & lesbians are seeking marriage, not the avoidance of marriage like the polygamist moochers. We are seeking the same benefits and protections of marriage that the opposite-sex married couples have. In order for you to suggest that gays & lesbians are wanting to get married so they can mooch off the government, you will have to include all those one-man-one-woman married couples as moochers too? (smile).... Just to stop you before you get into a whole spill about the government getting out of the business of giving benefits to married couples completely,,, Gays & Lesbians will still want to get married because they are living like married couples anyway, and the legal protections are just as important to them as it is to the straight married couples. So, you're saying that ALL gays & lesbians want to marry same sex partners? AND, that ALL polygamists are nothing more than moochers? Well then, reckon I'll just have to bow to your superior bank of....knowledge! BTW....for your general fund of knowledge, ya might wish to consider that many of these \"moochers\" are independently weathy individuals who want absolutely NOTHING to do with the government and live in compounds to get as far away from government as is physically possible.

        "reply": " The red flag is \"compounds\". They have compounds because they want to keep their people in a bubble away from the outside world, and avoid intrusions into their secretive world by those living near the compound. The bubble is an excellent way to control people and it removes the ability for the followers to make other choices. When you have people raised in such compounds, their belief system becomes hard wired and then you have willing participants who will abide by such notions as arranged marriages, child brides, and incest. Perfect environment for religious cults. I don't think I'm ready to throw my support in their direction, but your free to continue advocating for their cause.",
