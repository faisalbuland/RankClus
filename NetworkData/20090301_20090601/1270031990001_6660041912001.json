It is a convenient excuse for them that is horribly inconvenient for everyone else. Look at Westboro Baptist church. If you\u2019re not familiar with them google it.

Look at Westboro Baptist Church. Are you going to tell me that you lump them in with Christianity in general? Do you honestly believe that these people are trying to spread God\u2019s word in the way God intended? I for one do not lump Muslims into the same category as the extremists who crashed into the WTC. There are a lot of Christians out there who misrepresent Gods word and the life of Jesus. Jesus\u2019 life set the example for all Christians to follow and nowhere in there did he ever kill anyone one to deliver his message. If someone asked him to leave because they didn\u2019t want to hear his message, he did. Being a Christian is a slippery slope. On one side you\u2019re always tempted to sin, and sometimes you fail. Then you pick up the pieces and try again. Every Christian sets a bad example because everyone sins, including Christians. Everyone has their addictions and vices, including Christians. The point is to live your life the best you can and communicate with God through Jesus and pray for forgiveness.",

I can assure you I\u2019ve never read anywhere in the bible where Jesus said \u201cGo and bring my message by force\u201d. Yes there have been many misplaced Christians over time. Look at Westboro Baptist Church. Are you going to tell me that you lump them in with Christianity in general? Do you honestly believe that these people are trying to spread God\u2019s word in the way God intended? I for one do not lump Muslims into the same category as the extremists who crashed into the WTC. There are a lot of Christians out there who misrepresent Gods word and the life of Jesus. Jesus\u2019 life set the example for all Christians to follow and nowhere in there did he ever kill anyone one to deliver his message. If someone asked him to leave because they didn\u2019t want to hear his message, he did. Being a Christian is a slippery slope. On one side you\u2019re always tempted to sin, and sometimes you fail. Then you pick up the pieces and try again. Every Christian sets a bad example because everyone sins, including Christians. Everyone has their addictions and vices, including Christians. The point is to live your life the best you can and communicate with God through Jesus and pray for forgiveness.",

While Bill constructs a logical reply... People can draw from their psyche anything they can think of to justify their dysfunctions... and completely believe in it. To say people kill due to mental illness is to accuse every military person, cop, etc. as being so (crazy.) Violence is 'crazy' period. What makes religious justifications even crazier is that its done more or less with the support of a belief system that often advocates peace and reconciliation.... (or they might kill you!)
