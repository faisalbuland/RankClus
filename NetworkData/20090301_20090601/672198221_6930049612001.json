Those who wear their religion as a badge of false pride and honor that sets them apart or over others. I know the type well. I also know the truly religious well. His name was Lt.Col. Jack Jones. He joined the Marines as a private during WWII. He became a Marine Raider. He rose through the ranks and obtained a commission by the time of the Korean War. He served on alot of sneaky, classifed missions around the world to include Africa. In the early stages of Vietnam, he seized a grenade that had been thrown near him and his men and threw it back. It blew off all the fingers of his left hand. When I knew him he was my Highschool social studies teacher. He was also the Bishop of the local Mormon Ward. It was the 70s. Bad economy, my dad was working two jobs and all the overtime he could get. Even my 70 year old grandfather had come out of retirement to build houses. My dad had started re-roofing our house but got stopped halfway through. Lt.Col. Jones drove by our house on his way home from work. One day he showed up on the doorstep with a hammer and tool belt. He asked my mom where the ladder was, and then he went up and finished re-roofing our house. This is the kind of thing truly religious Mormons do. I won't argue with you though. The other kind exist. As for your wife. I'm pretty sure she wanted an eternity you couldn't provide in your present state of beliefs right? This is an eternity I've pretty much given up on to stay with my wife...who you probably share a few sentiments about Mormons with. Oh well. I always figured God wasn't a bureaucrat and that he'd make things \"right\" no matter what the \"rule book\" said.",
