Nothing but solid performance from AMD for me. Original Vista was a slow dog. Vista is much improved with the addition of SP1 and SP2 is coming out in April I think. Vista never will be what it was originally meant to be but it is still an improvement over XP. I think the upcoming Windows 7 will be closer to what we were all hoping for. XP will only recognize 3Gb of RAM no matter what you put in the box and it will only utilize 2Gb for most applications. Vista will recognize 4Gb and it can access all of it. Vista doesn't hog your resources like XP. Vista will also need a graphics card that can support DirectX 9.0c with at least 128MB of onboard memory. For a comparison between all three systems, go here: >http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=3236&page=2 Right now I'm runnig an AMD 64 system and it rocks. Having said that, I think that Intel has the overall speed advantage right now but when you compare the Phenom II X4 to it's Intel equivalent, the Core i7 940, it's a pretty close match and when you compare costs, it wins hands down. The real speed freak is the Intel QX9770 but it's very expensive and it runs hot so to take advantage you probably need liquid cooling. Get out your calculator and decide if you really need all that speed. Actually, I think a Linux OS variant like Ubuntu beats 'em all (including OS X which is really just a cut down Linux for Mac) as far as stability, and the ability to get the OS tuned optimally but it's still a bit too geeky for prime time and most of the applications I need won't run on it. Linux also suffers from the fact that major outfits like Adobe won't port a version to Linux native but I think that will change in the future. Best of all, Linux is free. Linux can access as much RAM as you can stuff into the box. Hope this helps a bit.",
