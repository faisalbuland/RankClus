By Fetrat Zerak in Farah (ARR No. 319, 23-Apr-09) Abdullah Jan and Abdul Khaleq are both from the Pushtrod district of Farah province in western Afghanistan. Both are young, unemployed, and seek work as day laborers, for which they get about 200 afghani (4 US dollars) per job. There is one big difference between them though: while Abdul Khaleq earns his money by digging ditches, painting houses, and other manual labour, Abdullah Jan, not his real name, does so by attacking police checkpoints. He is a Taleban part-timer. \u201cI am the only breadwinner in our family of eight,\u201d said Abdullah Jan, a 22-year-old from a small village. \u201cI went to Iran three times to try to find work, but I was expelled. I was in debt, and my father told me to go to the city. I looked for a job for three weeks, but then my brother got sick and needed medical treatment. He later died. Two of my friends then suggested that I go to the local Taleban.\u201d His mother was against it, said Abdullah Jan, and tried repeatedly to dissuade him. His father, however, kept silent. \u201cMy first assignment was to attack the police checkpoint in Guakhan district,\u201d recalled Abdullah Jan. \u201cWe killed four policemen, and we lost two of our own. Another one was injured. The fight lasted for two hours, with the real Taleban encouraging us from behind the lines, saying \u2018go on, further, move, move, move.\u2019 \u201cWhen it ended, I was paid 400 afghani by the local commander. He said that if I performed better in the future, I would get more money. Since then, I have participated in five more attacks, and I make about 1,000 afghani per week.\u201d Under this ad hoc arrangement, Abdullah Jan is a Taleban for only a few hours per week. Other than that, he goes about his business like any other citizen. He has no gun or any other equipment that marks him as an insurgent, and he does not consider himself to be one. \u201cI am just fighting for the money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I find another job, I\u2019ll leave this one as soon as possible.\u201d By some estimates, up to 70 per cent of the Taleban are unemployed young men just looking for a way to make a living. In Farah, Helmand, Uruzgan, Zabul, and other southern provinces, the majority of insurgents are fighting for money, not ideology. But they are caught in a vicious circle: as long as their provinces are unstable, there is little investment that could generate employment opportunities. However, in the absence of jobs, they join the insurgents, prolonging the violence and guaranteeing that security and development, remain but a distant dream. Mohammad Omar Rassouli, chief of police of Pushtrod district, confirmed Abdullah Jan\u2019s story, pointing to unemployment as the main motivating factor in the surge of these Taleban day-labourers. \u201cFarah is now dominated by unemployment and poor living conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what makes young men join the opposition. \u201cThe number of attacks on checkpoints has risen lately, and the only reason I see for this is that young men are joining the opposition for very small amounts of money. \u201cThe opposition is getting stronger, and we can do nothing. These young men are only armed while they are fighting. Other than that, they are just normal people in their homes, which makes it very difficult for us to identify them.\u201d The job is not without its risks, according to Abdullah Jan. \u201cI had a close friend, Rahmatullah. He was very brave,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he was martyred when we attacked the Karez Shekha checkpoint two weeks ago. Since then I have lost interest in this job, and I hope to find something else soon. I do not want to be killed, since I am the sole support of my family.\u201d Abdul Khaleq, meanwhile, does odd jobs in Farah city, the provincial capital. He makes about 200 afghani when there is work to be had. But he does not want to risk his life. \u201cMy cousin and I were unemployed in our village,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were asked many times to join the Taleban. But we did not accept. I do not have a steady job, but still, it is better than being killed.\u201d Abdullah Jan disagrees. \u201cI have to work with the Taleban,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThere is no other job except stealing or kidnapping. I think this is better than stealing. If we are killed, we are martyrs. This is what the mullahs say. They tell us we are doing jihad.\u201d Mullah Sadeq, the Taleban chief for Pushtrod and Khak Safed districts, told IWPR that the movement was justified in recruiting Farah\u2019s unemployed youth. \u201cAll young men should participate in the jihad and defend their country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will use any tool in our fight against the government and the foreign forces.\u201d According to Mullah Sadeq, there was a sliding scale of remuneration for Taleban fighters, but he declined to be more specific. \u201cThe money we give those young men is just for pocket money,\u201d he said of the day-labourers. The authorities in Pushtrod and Khak Safed estimate that more than 500 young men are now working with the Taleban. One elder, who did not want to be named, explained that recruits like Abdullah Jan were used almost exclusively as attack soldiers, \u201cThe Taleban do not want to lose their veteran fighters in these small skirmishes.\u201d The young men were often deployed outside their home villages or districts, he said, to avoid the possibility that they might be recognised by those they were fighting, or that they might be asked to attack friends or relatives. Laying mines or burning schools are more delicate operations, added the elder, and were usually performed by regular Taleban. Afghan commentators say the Taleban\u2019s recruitment of part-timer fighters is a worrying development, as it shows how easily they can draft ordinary Afghans into their ranks. \u201cThis tactic should be studied,\u201d said one political analyst, who did not want to give his name. \u201cThey are provoking more and more people to violence, and extending their influence in the society.\u201d Fetrat Zerak is the pseudonym of an IWPR trainee in Farah.
