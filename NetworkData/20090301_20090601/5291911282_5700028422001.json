I am on a strict diet and workout program to get down to the desired rate so that I can have a chance at enlisting in the Marine Corps. But one issue I have run into, that I knew would be a problem, is my right hand. I broke my hand when I was 16 and now my wrist is fused and reenforced with a 7 inch steel plate. Now I can move my fingers and twist my hand, but I can't bend it. They are saying this could prevent me from joining. I want to serve. This country has given so much to me and I want to give back to it. I can do everything anyone else can. My hand hasn't stopped me yet and won't. I am unclear as to what I should do.",

I always did mine on my finger tips from wrestling to improve grip strength... Can you do up-downs/grass drills, and low crawl without pain or injury to that wrist? That's the kind of thing a guy doing broken field maneuvers under fire in combat would have to be able to do in reality. If ya can't, ya shouldn't... But here is an option: If you really want to serve, and in uniform, look into Law Enforcement. You could serve your community in a challenging way with plenty of real dangers to worry about. My son cracked some vertebrae in his back playing football and was denied by all military services. Now, he is a gungho policeman with Black Belts in Karate, Kung Fu and Tai Kwando.
