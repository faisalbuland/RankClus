People don't like Bush because he was hard headed. They didn't like his political picks either. The one thing I will never like about President Bush is that he lied to us about certain things and he let many of todays problems go without investigating any of it. No over sight, no regulations. Obama on the other hand is repeating some of the same mistakes Bush did but the only difference that I see is he using Bush as a scrape goat. He is appointing these young guns who come up with a plan but no alternate plan to go to in case something doesn't work out. In other words we don't have a safety net to fall back on. Obama is smart. Very smart. He is a very good listener. Something Bush was not. The one thing that IMO President Obama is missing is that he does not have a good back up plan and that he is not doing anything to stop this current mess from ever happening again. Wall street was out of control. It was run by a bunch of greedy sub par Americans who I think should be deported to Somalia to run that countries economy. I really believe that most of the illegal Aliens from Mexico are better then these low life Hedge fund people are. If IMO, Obama had the experience needed to run this country he would have looked more into the life and background of Geithner and some of his other picks. Just sitting around the living room drinking a glass of wine with them and talking about their college days is not going to get it. We live in violent times. It's not all about the money anymore. He really needs to understand that. I don't think he does right now. You can't save everyone. Believe it or not there will always be some out there that don't want an education, a job, or allot of money. However, they will always want a safe place just to rest without having to be nervous about it. Lets do the three most important things I believe should be done before we tackle all these other problems. Stabilize our economy, our boarders, and our health before we take on the problems of the rest of the world.",

        "reply": "President Bush spent allot of money on the War on Terror. We forget that almost 4,000 people were killed on our soil by a bunch of mad men who want to see All non-Muslims dead. People don't like Bush because he was hard headed. They didn't like his political picks either. The one thing I will never like about President Bush is that he lied to us about certain things and he let many of todays problems go without investigating any of it. No over sight, no regulations. Obama on the other hand is repeating some of the same mistakes Bush did but the only difference that I see is he using Bush as a scrape goat. He is appointing these young guns who come up with a plan but no alternate plan to go to in case something doesn't work out. In other words we don't have a safety net to fall back on. Obama is smart. Very smart. He is a very good listener. Something Bush was not. The one thing that IMO President Obama is missing is that he does not have a good back up plan and that he is not doing anything to stop this current mess from ever happening again. Wall street was out of control. It was run by a bunch of greedy sub par Americans who I think should be deported to Somalia to run that countries economy. I really believe that most of the illegal Aliens from Mexico are better then these low life Hedge fund people are. If IMO, Obama had the experience needed to run this country he would have looked more into the life and background of Geithner and some of his other picks. Just sitting around the living room drinking a glass of wine with them and talking about their college days is not going to get it. We live in violent times. It's not all about the money anymore. He really needs to understand that. I don't think he does right now. You can't save everyone. Believe it or not there will always be some out there that don't want an education, a job, or allot of money. However, they will always want a safe place just to rest without having to be nervous about it. Lets do the three most important things I believe should be done before we tackle all these other problems. Stabilize our economy, our boarders, and our health before we take on the problems of the rest of the world.",

Coming soon, gold $1500.00 an oz, paper money zero ! Will gold become a trade purchase commodity ? Without a doubt he who has the most gold in the end wins ! It\u2019s time to quit throwing blame toward Bush, the balls all in Obamas court but last I heard most democrats don\u2019t even want to play with him. Oh yea, anyone here been invited to the Obama white house music concerts ? You should have been you paid for them. I suppose the best way to handle the economy is just laugh about it the way Obama has and pass the buck to our Grandchildren\u2019s Grandchildren, assuming America hasn\u2019t been sold to pay its debt.",

        "content": "President Bush spent allot of money on the War on Terror. We forget that almost 4,000 people were killed on our soil by a bunch of mad men who want to see All non-Muslims dead. People don't like Bush because he was hard headed. They didn't like his political picks either. The one thing I will never like about President Bush is that he lied to us about certain things and he let many of todays problems go without investigating any of it. No over sight, no regulations. Obama on the other hand is repeating some of the same mistakes Bush did but the only difference that I see is he using Bush as a scrape goat. He is appointing these young guns who come up with a plan but no alternate plan to go to in case something doesn't work out. In other words we don't have a safety net to fall back on. Obama is smart. Very smart. He is a very good listener. Something Bush was not. The one thing that IMO President Obama is missing is that he does not have a good back up plan and that he is not doing anything to stop this current mess from ever happening again. Wall street was out of control. It was run by a bunch of greedy sub par Americans who I think should be deported to Somalia to run that countries economy. I really believe that most of the illegal Aliens from Mexico are better then these low life Hedge fund people are. If IMO, Obama had the experience needed to run this country he would have looked more into the life and background of Geithner and some of his other picks. Just sitting around the living room drinking a glass of wine with them and talking about their college days is not going to get it. We live in violent times. It's not all about the money anymore. He really needs to understand that. I don't think he does right now. You can't save everyone. Believe it or not there will always be some out there that don't want an education, a job, or allot of money. However, they will always want a safe place just to rest without having to be nervous about it. Lets do the three most important things I believe should be done before we tackle all these other problems. Stabilize our economy, our boarders, and our health before we take on the problems of the rest of the world.",
