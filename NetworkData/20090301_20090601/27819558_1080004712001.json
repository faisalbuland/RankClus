Toklas LGBT Democratic Club's Pridc Breakfast and to congratulate you on continuing a legacy of success, stretching back thirty-six years. As one of the oldest and most influential LGBT organizations in the country, you have continually rallied to support Democratic candidates and causes, and have fought tirelessly to secure equal rights and opportunities for LGBT Americans in California and throughout the country. As the Democratic nominee for President, I am proud to join with and support the LGBT community in an effort to set our nation on a course that recognizes LGBT Americans with full equality under the law. That is why I support extending fully equal rights and benefits to same sex couples under both state and federal law. That is why I support repealing the Defense of Marriage Act and the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and the passage of laws to protect LGBT Americans from hate crimes and employment discrimination. And that is why I oppose the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the California Constitution, and similar efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution or those of other states. For too long, issues of LGBT rights have been exploited by those seeking to divide us. It's time to move beyond polarization and live up to our founding promise of equality by treating all our citizens with dignity and respect. This is no less than a core issue about who we are as Democrats and as Americans. Finally, I want to congratulate all of you who have shown your love for each other by getting married these last few weeks. My thanks again to the Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club for allowing me to be a part of today's celebration. I look forward to working with you in the coming months and years, and I wish you all continued success. Sincerely, Barack Obama >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid74685.asp",

I just want to remind you all of this... That does happen, for both hetero and homo \"lovers\". Passion is difficult to deal with. Most of the problems we had in Army Family Advocacy was \"unleashed\" passion-gone-wrong between heterosexual lovers, spouses, etc. And it often created 'unit cohesion' problems as well. It is no different with gay lovers either. They are still human and will act accordingly, depending on their self control. At the AF base I teach college at, a career 19 years AF nurse was finked on by a civilian jilted lover. Word of mouth from a vengeful lover got her kicked out and now she has taken the AF to court over it. However, the DA/DT law does have a clause that if it is suspected someone who 'confesses' is doing so to get out, the military does not have to kick them out! Therefore there are cases where people have come out, been investigated and nothing done, even though they are gay! I know one such situation where an artillery man came out in one of my classes. He then told his command, they sent him to the Chaplain and he simply said \"those things happen\" and nothing has happen to him. He claims his recruiter even knew he was gay. He didn't want to get out, he just wanted to get it out and over with that he was gay. Last I knew he was still in the Army and still going to college and feeling better about it all. My own feeling from my experience this past three years of examining the DA/DT issues is it is overlooked by commands, etc. about as much as adultery or heterosexual sodomy is. It's high time to reject the silly rule and replace it with nothing and let gays and lesbians live their life serving in the military free from apprehension they could lose their jobs.... like anyone else who chooses to serve their country. I'm still amazed any homosexuals would choose to join! And I admire and respect their courage to do so! That's patriotism!",
