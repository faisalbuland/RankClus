This is not to be confused with Haunta Virus or West Nile Virus which are also sweeping the West and killing people every year. These, like Flu, are caused by viruses are are very difficult to treat. Haunta Virus is native to the South West Desert, is carried by mice and is contracted by breathing dust from there droppings while cleaning out sheds etc. with a very high percent (70-80%) fatality in a very short period of time. West Nile is mosquito borne, like malaria, and causes flu-like symptoms which most people don't associate with a bite, and never report. In a few, it goes ballistic and usually kills them. Of course, those usually end up in hospitals, so the disease is identified, causing alarm. Survival rate is about the same as most bad types of Flu. Drain and spraying mosquito habitat goes a long way to preventing this one, along with the use of deet during twilight and dawn of warm days when the mosquito is about - - As for this most recent outbreak of Flu, I would still guess that the reason Mexicans are suffering such high mortality rate may be due to the Age-Old Native American lack of immunity to diseases originating in Euro-Asia. A high percentage of Mexicans still have pure or near pure Native American ancestry. Smallpox and other such diseases may have killed 3-4,000,000 American Indians as the Colonists and Pioneers move Westward, as compared to the much fewer numbers that were killed in conflicts and removals. That situation may be again happening - - I'm guessing a person with ethnic diversity would have more ability to produce anti-bodies for a wider variety of diseases.

About the only time people get it is if they mess around with the critters in some way, letting them get into their camp gear/supplies, etc...or as in one case, killing and eating them during \"Survival Hikes\" which are often conducted by \"get down to earth\" types in the South West Deserts. Fleas and lice are still the common vectors... The last case I heard of, a young person on a survival hike was killing and eating ground squirrels. After he got home he got very sick, boils in armpits etc... They thought it was Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, often gotten from ticks, but no... Had them stumped, but a doctor from India or Pakistan recognized the symptoms. I can't remember if the kid died or not, but the disease is treatable with antibiotics if recognized soon enough, because it's a bacteria.
