From reading the book, I understood that the lower-rung CIA intelligence staffers had got it right: there was a lot of uncertainty about Saddam's WMD. But this uncertainty turned into a certainty by the time it reached the White House. So it was the organizational dynamics that were to blame, rather than the intelligence. The book is a great and insighful read - it's called <Why your boss is programmed to be a dictator>...it's time we stopped blaming hte CIA",

Exactly!! Saddam Hussein had WMD's...hell, he used them against his own people. Don't think for a moment that he wasn't developing more advanced WMD's. Of course, some people would say that the \"inspectors\" never found any! Hell, the inspectors were NEVER given full access of the country. They were only given access to the parts of Iraq that Saddam knew were free and clear of WMD's or anything that might resemble a WMD. Just because the inspectors didn't find any WMD's, doesn't mean they didn't exist, especially when he absolutely HAD WMD's. Definitely NOT rocket science to come to this conclusion, hell, you don't even need a high school diploma. You're right outlaws93, Hussein did unspeakable horror to his own people, and that has been well documented, as well as accounts from people who have witnessed the atrocities first hand. Of course, I never actually saw them up close and personal (although munitions are my specialty, hence my screen-name), but there have been quite a few people from within Hussein's former regime that have collaborated the existence of Iraq's WMD program.",
