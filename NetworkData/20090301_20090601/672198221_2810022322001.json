        "content": "\"Nancy Lied and Gitmo prisoners Died\" I told people she was a liar, now here is the proof. quote: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly was told in February 2003 by her intelligence aide, Michael Sheehy, that waterboarding was used on CIA terror detainee Abu Zubaydah, directly contradicting Pelosi's account that she had never been informed of the technique's use. According to a report, Sheehy attended a briefing with Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., in February 2003 and discussed the CIA's use of waterboarding. When the aide told Pelosi waterboarding had actually been used on the Al Qaeda terrorist, she didn't object because she was not personally briefed on the matter, an unnamed source confirmed to CNN. Pelosi then supported a letter drafted by Harman, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and sent to the Bush administration, raising concerns over the technique, the network reported. A CIA document made public last week shows that Pelosi received a briefing in September 2002 on the tactics used on Zubaydah, an Al Qaeda leader and one of three prisoners subjected to waterboarding. Pelosi said she was told the agency was discussing its legal right to use the tactic in the future. \"We were not -- I repeat -- were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used,\" said Pelosi, D-Calif. The House majority leader reluctantly agreed Tuesday that congressional hearings should investigate Pelosi's assertion that she wasn't informed, more than six years ago, that harsh interrogation methods were used on the Al Qaeda leader. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called Republican challenges to Pelosi's assertion a diversion from the real question of whether the Bush administration tortured terrorist suspects. Nonetheless, he acknowledged the controversy should be resolved.

According to a report, Sheehy attended a briefing with Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., in February 2003 and discussed the CIA's use of waterboarding.

Pelosi then supported a letter drafted by Harman, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and sent to the Bush administration, raising concerns over the technique, the network reported. A CIA document made public last week shows that Pelosi received a briefing in September 2002 on the tactics used on Zubaydah, an Al Qaeda leader and one of three prisoners subjected to waterboarding. Pelosi said she was told the agency was discussing its legal right to use the tactic in the future. \"We were not -- I repeat -- were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used,\" said Pelosi, D-Calif. The House majority leader reluctantly agreed Tuesday that congressional hearings should investigate Pelosi's assertion that she wasn't informed, more than six years ago, that harsh interrogation methods were used on the Al Qaeda leader.

According to a report, Sheehy attended a briefing with Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., in February 2003 and discussed the CIA's use of waterboarding. When the aide told Pelosi waterboarding had actually been used on the Al Qaeda terrorist, she didn't object because she was not personally briefed on the matter, an unnamed source confirmed to CNN. Pelosi then supported a letter drafted by Harman, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and sent to the Bush administration, raising concerns over the technique, the network reported. A CIA document made public last week shows that Pelosi received a briefing in September 2002 on the tactics used on Zubaydah, an Al Qaeda leader and one of three prisoners subjected to waterboarding. Pelosi said she was told the agency was discussing its legal right to use the tactic in the future. \"We were not -- I repeat -- were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used,\" said Pelosi, D-Calif. The House majority leader reluctantly agreed Tuesday that congressional hearings should investigate Pelosi's assertion that she wasn't informed, more than six years ago, that harsh interrogation methods were used on the Al Qaeda leader. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called Republican challenges to Pelosi's assertion a diversion from the real question of whether the Bush administration tortured terrorist suspects. Nonetheless, he acknowledged the controversy should be resolved.

According to a report, Sheehy attended a briefing with Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., in February 2003 and discussed the CIA's use of waterboarding. When the aide told Pelosi waterboarding had actually been used on the Al Qaeda terrorist, she didn't object because she was not personally briefed on the matter, an unnamed source confirmed to CNN. Pelosi then supported a letter drafted by Harman, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and sent to the Bush administration, raising concerns over the technique, the network reported. A CIA document made public last week shows that Pelosi received a briefing in September 2002 on the tactics used on Zubaydah, an Al Qaeda leader and one of three prisoners subjected to waterboarding. Pelosi said she was told the agency was discussing its legal right to use the tactic in the future. \"We were not -- I repeat -- were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used,\" said Pelosi, D-Calif. The House majority leader reluctantly agreed Tuesday that congressional hearings should investigate Pelosi's assertion that she wasn't informed, more than six years ago, that harsh interrogation methods were used on the Al Qaeda leader. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called Republican challenges to Pelosi's assertion a diversion from the real question of whether the Bush administration tortured terrorist suspects. Nonetheless, he acknowledged the controversy should be resolved.

That's how it works, party set aside, those responsible are responsible. To state specifically that Pelosi lied is BS. She may have lied but because of the secrecy involved we don't know for certain. Just one more reason for investigations. So does this mean we can stop the partisan bickering on which party has the moral high ground? As far as I'm concerned yes we can. I don't speak for the Democratic Party, you don't speak for Republicans. On my part, if Democrats are guilty of lying about the issue or are accomplices...they too can stand before the judge, and the American People.",

According to a report, Sheehy attended a briefing with Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., in February 2003 and discussed the CIA's use of waterboarding. When the aide told Pelosi waterboarding had actually been used on the Al Qaeda terrorist, she didn't object because she was not personally briefed on the matter, an unnamed source confirmed to CNN. Pelosi then supported a letter drafted by Harman, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and sent to the Bush administration, raising concerns over the technique, the network reported. A CIA document made public last week shows that Pelosi received a briefing in September 2002 on the tactics used on Zubaydah, an Al Qaeda leader and one of three prisoners subjected to waterboarding. Pelosi said she was told the agency was discussing its legal right to use the tactic in the future. \"We were not -- I repeat -- were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used,\" said Pelosi, D-Calif. The House majority leader reluctantly agreed Tuesday that congressional hearings should investigate Pelosi's assertion that she wasn't informed, more than six years ago, that harsh interrogation methods were used on the Al Qaeda leader. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called Republican challenges to Pelosi's assertion a diversion from the real question of whether the Bush administration tortured terrorist suspects.
