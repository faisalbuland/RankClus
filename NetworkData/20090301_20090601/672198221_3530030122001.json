Everybody knows that we just got finished watching and reading about another two dozen heros involved in that rescue of one of our ships crew from the Somali Pirates. Now Ollie is producing a special military show featuring the Navy SEAL Teams, their training and their weapons. It comes on Saturday night I believe at 8 or 9 EST. I'm also sure that every enemy to the US(which is 95% of the world) will enjoy it too. When will North just shut his mouth and go away into a peaceful retirement like the rest of us? Guess he needs the money.",

Everybody knows that we just got finished watching and reading about another two dozen heros involved in that rescue of one of our ships crew from the Somali Pirates. Now Ollie is producing a special military show featuring the Navy SEAL Teams, their training and their weapons. It comes on Saturday night I believe at 8 or 9 EST. I'm also sure that every enemy to the US(which is 95% of the world) will enjoy it too. When will North just shut his mouth and go away into a peaceful retirement like the rest of us?
