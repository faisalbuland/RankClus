Having said that, there are many women and men who manage both a military career and raising a family very well. But you do have to consider the consequences. I was gone when my younger son started T-Ball, when he learned to ride a bike, and when he had the chicken pox. I never got to see my older son participate in a swimming competition because I was always on duty. My younger son had to cope with his father having emergency surgery while I was TDY. There will absolutely be times when your military duty takes precedence over the needs of your family. Many parents try to compensate by giving their kids everything they want, which usually leads to having kids who have an overdeveloped sense of entitlement. And it absolutely takes both parents, whether both are in the service or not, to make it work.",

There will absolutely be times when your military duty takes precedence over the needs of your family.
