Hello, KNOCK KNOCK - is ANYONE HOME... Your 100-freaking days late now bub... Should-a told Nancy to cut back on those fancy EAR-MARKS - TOO LATE BABY NOW - ITs TOO LATE..call Babbs maybe her and her Bollywood friends will have a US Bailout Concert... The Legacy of THE ONE - bankrupted the richest country in the history the world - ALL with 100-DAYS... ---back--to--the--article--- Holders of U.S. debt will eventually \u201cget tired\u201d of buying it, causing interest rates on everything from auto loans to home mortgages to increase, Obama said. \u201cIt will have a dampening effect on our economy.\u201d Earlier this week, the Obama administration revised its own budget estimates and raised the projected deficit for this year to a record $1.84 trillion, up 5 percent from the February estimate. The revision for the 2010 fiscal year estimated the deficit at $1.26 trillion, up 7.4 percent from the February figure. The White House Office of Management and Budget also projected next year\u2019s budget will end up at $3.59 trillion, compared with the $3.55 trillion it estimated previously. Two weeks ago, the president proposed $17 billion in budget cuts, with plans to eliminate or reduce 121 federal programs. Republicans ridiculed the amount, saying that it represented one-half of 1 percent of the entire budget. They noted that Obama is seeking an $81 billion increase in other spending. ----end snip ---- Well, well, well, - it looks as though Obama finally got himself a calculator with enough ZEROS to keep up with his DEFICIT\u2026 Bummer is \u2013 too late now. That\u2019s what happens when you send a rookie to do VETERANS JOB. GM, Chrysler, and others are PACKING UP. They thought they were invincible \u2013 they figured he we can make the republicans pay the taxes so we can pay our constituents free-checks. Yep, sure can until the republicans decide to pull their companies and go somewhere else. Hey, we are still going to buy a car \u2013 radio \u2013 stereo \u2013 big TVs \u2013 blue jeans & cheeseburgers, right\u2026 well, if we can afford it that is \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s made here or elsewhere \u2013 if we want it \u2013 we\u2019ll buy it. Bummer is \u2013 we won\u2019t have the money to do it. Inflation is coming \u2013 high interest rates are coming \u2013 15-20% mortgage rates \u2013 Happy Meals for 45-bucks\u2026 Maybe Obama was thinking ahead when he talked about negotiations with Cuba. We just might need a few pointers from them on how to survive the coming Obamocrat era\u2026 Look at the Brightside \u2013 he can only tax 100% - and let\u2019s face \u2013 that really won\u2019t be that much more than we\u2019ll be paying anyway\u2026 What cha think about that snack tax \u2013 how about the soda tax \u2013 fuel tax \u2013 oh did you hear about the energy tax \u2013 yea that one is gonna sting \u2013 probably DOUBLE the average electric bill \u2013 oh and there\u2019s been talk about a \u201cMILAGE tax\u201d\u2026 them damn Democrats \u2013 they are creative when it comes to finding ways to steal our money\u2026 So, what-cha think is that enough change for ya in his first 4-5 months\u2026 I bet he\u2019s just getting warmed up\u2026 ...I hope they have more variety than potato soup everyday.

Mr. Bush wacked on three four hundred billion a year, without any complaints at all. Dave Actually, that\u2019s the problem \u2013 HE DID\u2026 his 2009 projections are already being readjusted BY HIM. The deficit will go 5% from what they just reported in February \u2013 which was probably calculated in Dec or early Jan at best. Again that is THIS year \u2013 and it\u2019s only MAY\u2026 Those calculations were made PRIOR to GM & Chrysler dropping 3500 dealerships \u2013 several parts manufacturers have pulled out and gone to Mexico \u2013 rumor is GM is going to Mexico or at least a large part of the manufacturing \u2013 and it does not include the umpteen other companies pulling out. Unemployment will steadily climb \u2013 and it is climbing faster than they ever thought it would. This thing is slipping out from under his control and it won\u2019t be too long before it can even be pulled back. The projection for 2010 projected deficit was just adjusted by an additional 7.4%. These are HUGE numbers\u2026 Earlier this week, the Obama administration revised its own budget estimates and raised the projected deficit for this year to a record $1.84 trillion, up 5 percent from the February estimate. The revision for the 2010 fiscal year estimated the deficit at $1.26 trillion, up 7.4 percent from the February figure. The White House Office of Management and Budget also projected next year\u2019s budget will end up at $3.59 trillion, compared with the $3.55 trillion it estimated previously. So, that means his projections will be adjusted again \u2013 and it is going the WRONG way! The issue is \u2013 NO ONE will be working so the FED cannot generate any taxes.

Check this little tidbit out\u2026 below\u2026 China's yuan 'set to usurp US dollar' as world's reserve currency The Chinese yuan is preparing to overtake the US dollar as the world's reserve currency, economist Nouriel Roubini has warned. Professor Roubini, of New York University's Stern business school, believes that while such a major change is some way off, the Chinese government is laying the ground for the yuan's ascendance. Known as \"Dr Doom\" for his negative stance, Prof Roubini argues that China is better placed than the US to provide a reserve currency for the 21st century because it has a large current account surplus, focused government and few of the economic worries the US faces. In a column in the New York Times, Prof Roubini warns that with the proposal for a new international reserve currency via the International Monetary Fund, Beijing has already begun to take steps to usurp the greenback. China will soon want to see the yuan included in the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights \"basket\", he warns, as well as seeing it \"used as a means of payment in bilateral trade.\" Prof Roubini's warning followed the US government's latest economic data that showed producer prices in April experienced their biggest year-on-year drop since 1950, falling 3.7pc. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit for the first time rose by 32,000 to 637,000 in the week to May 9. The increase meant the total number of people claiming benefits stood at to 6.56m, a record high for the 15th consecutive week in a row. ------end-snip--------- This is SERIOUS and he is not going to have any ability to do anything about it. They screwed up BIG TIME. They should have paid-off the mortgages in foreclosure. It would have ticked off folks but that would have kept our money IN THE SYSTEM. Those folks would suddenly have a spendable income again. They could BUY CARS \u2013 and other manufactured goods\u2026 The banks would have been forced to deal with their own problems with their freaking money. The Fed could have created some sort of deeds for those properties to work things through \u2013 but they didn\u2019t do that \u2013 THEY WENT SHOPPING. If anyone thinks being a freaking road and remodeling government buildings is going SAVE this economy \u2013 they need to change the brand of dope they smoke\u2026 He better get in front of this thing or we will collapse and it will not be pretty\u2026 I am all for giving him the chance but thus far - he BLOWING that chance and doing it in PRESIDENTIAL STYLE!
