There are times when parents get sick and tired of talking and dealing with counselors. You can talk to kids until you turn blue and your tongue drops out - IT DOES NOT SINK IN. Then you start taking away the fun things they like: PS2, Play Station and any computer access, that might get their attention. But when all else fails, get out a belt and smack that butt. I got mine smacked when I was a kid and so did my husband. Our parents did not play. And, when my son was born, when he started getting older, and I got tired of talking to him, I smacked his butt, but good. My motto was: I am raising you to be the warden, not an inmate. A warden has a job with benefits, a car or an SUV, a house, condo or a nice apartment, basically a life. An inmate doesn't even have his own name. Inmates have numbers given to them by the prison system and you \"will\" get up, leave your cell, go to work, ask to use the restroom, told when to eat, sleep, shower, you name it. You have no life. My kid understood exactly what I was talking about and got it the first time. I just hope and pray that he retains it.",
