The rail company says it has little control over operations by its corporate partner in Mexico. By Richard Marosi March 19, 2009 Reporting from San Diego \u2014 The U.S. Department of Justice filed lawsuits against Union Pacific Railroad Co. on Wednesday seeking $37 million in damages for allegedly failing to prevent its rail cars from being used to smuggle drugs into the country. U.S. customs inspectors on at least 38 occasions between 2001 and 2006 discovered marijuana or cocaine in Union Pacific rail cars at border crossings at Brownsville, Texas, and Calexico, Calif., according to the two complaints filed Wednesday. Federal authorities say the Omaha-based company violated laws requiring transportation operators to submit accurate descriptions of their cargo to customs inspectors. The lawsuit was filed after Union Pacific refused to pay several penalties, saying it has limited ability to control train operations by its corporate partner in Mexico. \"We're being punished for drug smuggling from Mexico that we have no ability to prevent,\" said Donna Kush, a spokeswoman for Union Pacific, North America's largest railroad company. The federal government said its inspectors found more than two tons of marijuana and more than 100 kilograms of cocaine on company rail cars, many of which were listed as empty on manifests, the complaint alleges. Seizures included 61 kilograms of marijuana found in the spine of a rail car, 29 kilograms of marijuana discovered in a hidden compartment of a flat-bed car and 117 kilograms of cocaine in a false wall of a rail car at the border crossing in Brownsville. \"Securing the nation's rail system against the threat of cross-border smuggling requires the compliance and cooperation of the rail industry, Jayson P. Ahern, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement. The Department of Homeland Security has told the company that it should hire an outside security company or work with its business partner, Ferrocarril Mexicano, of which it is a part owner. The spokeswoman for Union Pacific, which has its own police force in the U.S., said that setting up a security team in Mexico would be unrealistic and potentially dangerous. \"We wouldn't be allowed to carry arms or use K-9 teams. . . . We'd be unarmed in the face of vicious drug gangs,\" Kush said.

The rail company says it has little control over operations by its corporate partner in Mexico. By Richard Marosi March 19, 2009 Reporting from San Diego \u2014 The U.S. Department of Justice filed lawsuits against Union Pacific Railroad Co. on Wednesday seeking $37 million in damages for allegedly failing to prevent its rail cars from being used to smuggle drugs into the country. U.S. customs inspectors on at least 38 occasions between 2001 and 2006 discovered marijuana or cocaine in Union Pacific rail cars at border crossings at Brownsville, Texas, and Calexico, Calif., according to the two complaints filed Wednesday. Federal authorities say the Omaha-based company violated laws requiring transportation operators to submit accurate descriptions of their cargo to customs inspectors. The lawsuit was filed after Union Pacific refused to pay several penalties, saying it has limited ability to control train operations by its corporate partner in Mexico. \"We're being punished for drug smuggling from Mexico that we have no ability to prevent,\" said Donna Kush, a spokeswoman for Union Pacific, North America's largest railroad company. The federal government said its inspectors found more than two tons of marijuana and more than 100 kilograms of cocaine on company rail cars, many of which were listed as empty on manifests, the complaint alleges. Seizures included 61 kilograms of marijuana found in the spine of a rail car, 29 kilograms of marijuana discovered in a hidden compartment of a flat-bed car and 117 kilograms of cocaine in a false wall of a rail car at the border crossing in Brownsville. \"Securing the nation's rail system against the threat of cross-border smuggling requires the compliance and cooperation of the rail industry, Jayson P. Ahern, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement. The Department of Homeland Security has told the company that it should hire an outside security company or work with its business partner, Ferrocarril Mexicano, of which it is a part owner. The spokeswoman for Union Pacific, which has its own police force in the U.S., said that setting up a security team in Mexico would be unrealistic and potentially dangerous. \"We wouldn't be allowed to carry arms or use K-9 teams. . . . We'd be unarmed in the face of vicious drug gangs,\" Kush said.

With Customs, we use to seize boats (that was my job, not ships) if they were used in smuggling. In the late 90's, a ruling came down that we had to show the owner had knowledge of the criminal act. That's why we started seeing all the smuggler using some boat owned by a school teacher or something who just happened to \"loan\" them the boat for the night. Ya right. We also use to seize anything the smuggler owned that was way above what his documented income could afford. Ex: say he was supposedly a taxi driver yet owned a $500,000 home, yacht, etc, we would generally seize all that based on smuggling proceeds. Again, that all changed and we had to prove what income was earned based on the shipment we seized unless we could go back and collect evidence to show proceeds from past smuggling ventures were the source of income for the house, yacht, etc. Don",

I can understand an over-all manifest identifying X number of empties or a manifest for a ship load of empty containers, but we're not talking about container cars in the UP's case. According to the article, we're talking about empty box cars and empty flat cars. Yes, the railroad must provide the Border Patrol and INS documentation relating to how many cars, loaded or empty, they're bringing across the border, but empty cars do not require an individual manifest for what's on board because nothing is. So, the train crosses the border at Calexico/Mexicali and immediately enters the Custom's inspection yard. The train manifest lists 40 loaded cars and 10 empties. Bills of Lading are provided to identify what's in the loaded ones, but nothing more is required for the empties. The inspectors begin searching the train, opening doors to verify the cargo in those loaded cars. They bring out the dogs or run the cars through a scanner of some sort and do a walk around. They find dope HIDDEN in an empty boxcar, concealed behind a false front or secreted into the frame of the car. Then, they write the UP a ticket for not declaring and documenting the dope they didn't even know was there? That's outrageously unfair, wouldn't you say? I've pulled empty trailers across both borders, going both ways, and was subjected to an inspection every time. Nothing wrong with that. But, nobody ever threatened to fine me for not having a manifest which identified any dope hidden in the the trailer and, if they had, I'd have come unglued.",

That quantity gets manifested... each and every time.[/QUOTE] What kind of manifest would you have for each, individual empty container? I can understand an over-all manifest identifying X number of empties or a manifest for a ship load of empty containers, but we're not talking about container cars in the UP's case. According to the article, we're talking about empty box cars and empty flat cars. Yes, the railroad must provide the Border Patrol and INS documentation relating to how many cars, loaded or empty, they're bringing across the border, but empty cars do not require an individual manifest for what's on board because nothing is. So, the train crosses the border at Calexico/Mexicali and immediately enters the Custom's inspection yard. The train manifest lists 40 loaded cars and 10 empties. Bills of Lading are provided to identify what's in the loaded ones, but nothing more is required for the empties. The inspectors begin searching the train, opening doors to verify the cargo in those loaded cars. They bring out the dogs or run the cars through a scanner of some sort and do a walk around. They find dope HIDDEN in an empty boxcar, concealed behind a false front or secreted into the frame of the car. Then, they write the UP a ticket for not declaring and documenting the dope they didn't even know was there? That's outrageously unfair, wouldn't you say? I've pulled empty trailers across both borders, going both ways, and was subjected to an inspection every time. Nothing wrong with that. But, nobody ever threatened to fine me for not having a manifest which identified any dope hidden in the the trailer and, if they had, I'd have come unglued.",
