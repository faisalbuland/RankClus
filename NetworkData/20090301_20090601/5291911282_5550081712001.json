He had recieved the Purple Heart and Arcom w/ Valor device. He was apparently having difficulties in the life back home with his wife. In January he finally had tried and rie dto get the leadership within his unit to help him but to nno avail. He pulled out his semi auto weapon and began firing within the confines of his home. His wife escaped but even after a standoff with police he still did the final act of crying for help--killed himself. My issue is WHY and WHERE were the squad leaders and platoon sgts and 1sgs and the commanders to help him along. He was seeking treatment at the hospital. What is the issue here that our Soldiers find it so hard to seek help and have to feel that the only way out to end it all? WHY!?",

I was section leader at Dover AFB in 1959 when an airmen in my sections hung him self. We talked everyday and played poker together a couple of times a week. I never saw it coming. In 1963 my oldest brother killed himself. We knew he was sick with TB and we knew he was depressed but we could not watch him 24/7, he was 49 years old. In 1996 our then oldest DIL killed her self, she was only 25. I had known since she was nine years old. That was five years longer than my son had known her. I loved her, and still love her with all of my heart. We knew she had emotional problems and she was being seen by a counselor know one thought she was suicidal. I help my son for several hours on suspension of murder. They released him to me and it took three long days before they had the evidence they needed to prove she died by her own hand. And he was several miles away from home when it happened. It took my son five years before he could ever think of having another woman in his life. He has now been married to this fantastic lady who brought two more grandchildren into our lives. Again, none us can know the heart ache or answer the questions you have, but please know that our hearts, prayers and love goes out to you and his family and friends.

What utter bull****. Something that the Army tried back in the 70s was a \"Transitional Period\" at the end of a soldier's enlistment (3 months)in which the soldier could find a civilian occupation and OJT into it, while still remaining in the military.

I like your last statement a lot. HarleyDavidsonMan, nothing about this is ever going to make sense to you. Obviously, someone dropped the ball. But it's possible that your nephew DID see someone. I don't know all the details. Nothing anyone says is going to make it okay. Death is always wrong, doubly so when someone so young dies. The only thing you can do is get some little positive thing out of it by advocating for suicide prevention and mental health awareness. I do know that it is the responsibility of every member of a unit to look out for each other. And that sometimes you need to think outside the rank box to do it. If your Sergeant Major has left his weapon off safe inside the perimeter, you don't need to ask permission from God, point it out to him yourself, respectfully and calmly. He'll thank you for it. The Chain of Command is the rule we all live by, but sometimes you need to jump it. If a person senior to you is in trouble, maybe you need to talk to someone senior to HIM. If a peer is having problems, maybe you need to go to someone with some influence (chaplain, Sergeant Major, whoever) YOURSELF, instead of WAITING for the problem to go up the chain. If you have time, use the Chain of Command. If your instincts tell you that things are moving too fast, do what you need to. Just keep your Chain of Command informed \"Sergeant, I went and talked to the Chaplain about somebody today. Sorry I didn't wait and get your go-ahead, but I had a really bad feeling about his situation.\" Do the right thing, and damn the consequences. If you get in trouble, you get in trouble. Look out for your guys. But sometimes people just WON'T ask for help. I've been in some situations myself ( I was never suicidal though ), and I don't know why exactly, but I didn't want to ask for help. I tell you what though, that MOUNTAIN of #$%* I was dealing with suddenly seemed manageable, the minute I walked into Combat Mental Health in Kirkuk, Iraq and just said, \"Hey, I'm not handling this very well.\" You want to talk about a weight off your chest. . . Getting help is not necessarily a career-ender. I'm glad some very senior guys in the military have come forward to admit they went and got help. It's a good sign. None of us need to go it alone. We don't go it alone on the job in the military now do we? This message has been edited. Last edited by: Ruanne, Mon 09 March 2009 12:18 PM",

Way back in 1954 my bunk mate use him M1 to take his own life on my bed. We had been together for four weeks and I thought he was just like the rest of us who hated basic. I was section leader at Dover AFB in 1959 when an airmen in my sections hung him self. We talked everyday and played poker together a couple of times a week. I never saw it coming. In 1963 my oldest brother killed himself. We knew he was sick with TB and we knew he was depressed but we could not watch him 24/7, he was 49 years old. In 1996 our then oldest DIL killed her self, she was only 25. I had known since she was nine years old. That was five years longer than my son had known her. I loved her, and still love her with all of my heart. We knew she had emotional problems and she was being seen by a counselor know one thought she was suicidal. I help my son for several hours on suspension of murder. They released him to me and it took three long days before they had the evidence they needed to prove she died by her own hand. And he was several miles away from home when it happened. It took my son five years before he could ever think of having another woman in his life. He has now been married to this fantastic lady who brought two more grandchildren into our lives. Again, none us can know the heart ache or answer the questions you have, but please know that our hearts, prayers and love goes out to you and his family and friends. You never get over it but you learn to live with it. This message has been edited.

His wife escaped but even after a standoff with police he still did the final act of crying for help--killed himself. My issue is WHY and WHERE were the squad leaders and platoon sgts and 1sgs and the commanders to help him along. He was seeking treatment at the hospital. What is the issue here that our Soldiers find it so hard to seek help and have to feel that the only way out to end it all? WHY!? I'm so sorry about your nephew and you as well. It is all too common and I do truly understand your anger. I would imagine it's at least partially fueled by frustration. There are so many returning solders with problems and too few to help them. also they're dealing with the human mind Every single one of us is different. It's not like we're some mass produced thing that reacts and responds to everything the same way. I'm not passing myself off as any sort of expert but I do think I've spoken with enough returning solders over the past years to have some sort of handle as to what's going on. Every one of the vets are different and every one of them needs custom tailored treatment. there just aren't enough people to do that. As I think deeper into this I'm coming to the conclusion that those MDs., PHds and all the other dudes with more degrees than a thermometer lack one essential qualification to be helpful. How can any of them know what it was like to be there? They might as well try to treat a Martian. I'm thinking about some sort organized group of former combat veterans with professional guidance possibly being their best hope. I've been shooting my mouth off for too long. I think it's time to end this. I'll do so by again expressing my sympathy to all involved and again thanking all those brave men and women that keep us here at home safe.

What utter bull****. Two currently-serving general officers (one the CG of USAREUR) have come forward and said THEY sought counseling for issues related to their deployments.

When I came back to the world, I welded for a few years, but then jumped on the GI Bill, got a degree, and taught High School for 30 years. I would have never considered that option had it not been for that OJT period. I'm certain I'd fit into that category called \"maniac depressive\". It's not unusual for me to consider suicide several times a day at times. I'm certain that the chance the Army gave me to go in that other direction made a big difference. When I showed up the last day of my OJT in my Sgt. uniform to tell the kids I was going home, one little black kid, who had been a absolute pain in the azz every day, wrapped himself around my leg, started crying and screaming,\"Don't go! Don't go!\" His father was a high-ranking NCO that didn't treat him very well, but I'd tried to - - That was a life-changing experience, teaching others and coming outside of myself, that may have kept me alive all these years - - Wandering and Wondering",

I like your last statement a lot. HarleyDavidsonMan, nothing about this is ever going to make sense to you. Obviously, someone dropped the ball. But it's possible that your nephew DID see someone. I don't know all the details. Nothing anyone says is going to make it okay. Death is always wrong, doubly so when someone so young dies. The only thing you can do is get some little positive thing out of it by advocating for suicide prevention and mental health awareness. I do know that it is the responsibility of every member of a unit to look out for each other. And that sometimes you need to think outside the rank box to do it. If your Sergeant Major has left his weapon off safe inside the perimeter, you don't need to ask permission from God, point it out to him yourself, respectfully and calmly. He'll thank you for it. The Chain of Command is the rule we all live by, but sometimes you need to jump it. If a person senior to you is in trouble, maybe you need to talk to someone senior to HIM. If a peer is having problems, maybe you need to go to someone with some influence (chaplain, Sergeant Major, whoever) YOURSELF, instead of WAITING for the problem to go up the chain. If you have time, use the Chain of Command. If your instincts tell you that things are moving too fast, do what you need to. Just keep your Chain of Command informed \"Sergeant, I went and talked to the Chaplain about somebody today. Sorry I didn't wait and get your go-ahead, but I had a really bad feeling about his situation.\" Do the right thing, and damn the consequences. If you get in trouble, you get in trouble. Look out for your guys. But sometimes people just WON'T ask for help. I've been in some situations myself ( I was never suicidal though ), and I don't know why exactly, but I didn't want to ask for help. I tell you what though, that MOUNTAIN of #$%* I was dealing with suddenly seemed manageable, the minute I walked into Combat Mental Health in Kirkuk, Iraq and just said, \"Hey, I'm not handling this very well.\" You want to talk about a weight off your chest. . . Getting help is not necessarily a career-ender. I'm glad some very senior guys in the military have come forward to admit they went and got help. It's a good sign. None of us need to go it alone. We don't go it alone on the job in the military now do we? This message has been edited. Last edited by: Ruanne, Mon 09 March 2009 12:18 PM",
