The worst case I ever saw I may have told here before, but I'll tell it again as, to me, it's so indicative of what's wrong with co-ed training. I was approaching the trainee barracks at Ft. Leonard Wood one Sunday afternoon and heard voices which caused me to look up toward the third floor of the billets. Each floor had a very small, about 1 ft wide concrete, decorative ledge which ran beneath windows on the outside. I saw a male trainee out on that ledge, 3 floors above the ground, inching his way toward a group of girls leaning out of their windows and promising him sexual favors if he made it without falling to his death. All the female trainees in the company were housed on one end of the third floor, with a locked door between them and the men. That's where he was headed, with their encouragement. Was he desperate? You tell me. Would YOU have done that? (Just so you'll know, there was no official action taken against any of the participants in this little drama because I had no witnesses and could not positively indentify any of them from that distance. There WAS, however, some major azz burning and changes in security.)",

They were, and probably still are, desperate enough to risk Article 15's and even Courts Martial for spending a little time with the opposite sex. Their behaviors run the gamut from sneaking into each others quarters in the dead of night, going AWOL to a local motel, to engaging in sexual activity in culverts underneath the road to propositioning Drill Sergeants and Officers, too many times successfully. The worst case I ever saw I may have told here before, but I'll tell it again as, to me, it's so indicative of what's wrong with co-ed training. I was approaching the trainee barracks at Ft. Leonard Wood one Sunday afternoon and heard voices which caused me to look up toward the third floor of the billets. Each floor had a very small, about 1 ft wide concrete, decorative ledge which ran beneath windows on the outside. I saw a male trainee out on that ledge, 3 floors above the ground, inching his way toward a group of girls leaning out of their windows and promising him sexual favors if he made it without falling to his death. All the female trainees in the company were housed on one end of the third floor, with a locked door between them and the men. That's where he was headed, with their encouragement. Was he desperate? You tell me. Would YOU have done that? (Just so you'll know, there was no official action taken against any of the participants in this little drama because I had no witnesses and could not positively indentify any of them from that distance. There WAS, however, some major azz burning and changes in security.)",
