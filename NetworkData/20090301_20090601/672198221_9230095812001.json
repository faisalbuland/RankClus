Obama's quote from a speech in July 2008: \"We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.\" Now, a one-dimensional person who looks at American national security from a purely military angle would naturally think that he's talking about some civilian militia-type force. A person who understands national security sees it as multifaceted and contains many aspects of our lives as Americans. In fact, General James Jones, the current National Security Advisor sees it that way. His February 2009 speech at the 45th Munich Conference on Security Policy defined \"national security\" from an American perspective: \"...(W)e must understand the terms national security and international security are no longer limited to the ministries of defense and foreign ministries; in fact, it encompasses the economic aspects of our societies. It encompasses energy. It encompasses new threats, asymmetric threats involving proliferation, involving the illegal shipment of arms and narco-terrorism, and the like. Borders are no longer recognized and the simultaneity of the threats that face us are occurring at a more rapid pace. And as the President has detailed, a comprehensive approach to our national security and international security in the 21st century must identify and understand that the wider array of existing threats that threaten us. To name a few: -Terror and extremism has taken many lives and on many continents across the globe. -The ongoing struggle in Afghanistan and the activity along the Pakistani border is an international security challenge of the highest order. - The spread of nuclear and chemical biological and cyber-technologies that could upset the global order and cause catastrophe on an unimaginable scale is real. It is pressing and it is time that we dealt with it. - The overdependence on fossil fuels that endangers our security, our economies, and the health of the planet. - Protracted tribal, ethnic, and religious conflicts. - Poverty, corruption, and disease stands in the way of progress and causes great suffering in many parts of the world. - Narco-terrorism that provides the economic fuel for insurgencies. - And an economic crisis that serves as the foundation of our strength. \"...The President has made clear that to succeed against 21st century challenges, the United States must use, balance, and integrate all elements of national influence: our military and our diplomacy, our economy and our intelligence, and law enforcement capacity, our cultural outreach, and as was mentioned yesterday, the power of our moral example, in short, our values. Given this role, the NSC is by definition at the nexus of that effort. It integrates on a strategic sense all elements of our national security community towards the development of effective policy development and interagency cooperation. But to better carry out the president\u2019s priorities, the National Security Council must respond to the world the way it is and not as we wish it were. And it must consider the fusion of our national priorities within the broader international context and interest. The NSC\u2019s mission is relatively simple. It should perform the functions that it alone can perform and serve as a strategic center \u2013 and the word strategic is operative here \u2013 for the President\u2019s priorities...\" \"http://www.cfr.org/publication/18515/]http://www.cfr.org/publication/18515/\" This is what you didn't get in the \"mainstream media\" - so all that other stuff propagated by hardcore partisans has no merit. It's all opinion - so this belongs in Point/Counterpoint.",
