I own two, an M91 manufactured by Tula in 1895 and subsequently converted to a Finnish Nagant, and a 91/30 model made in 1943 by the Izhevsk armory I shot for the first time this past Sunday. You get more than what you pay for with these rifles. They are fun to shoot, and can be extremely accurate, depending on many factors. My Tula shoots very tight groups at 100 meters, while the Izhevsk seems to be shooting about 3\" low at the same range. They were sighted in with fixed bayonets, so a bayonet is not just a nice accessory, but necessary. The Russians were obssessed with the bayonet. I consider them cheap fun, and a great reminder of why the Nazis lost WWII. The Izhevsk is pretty roughly made, typical of wartime models, while the older models will have better metal machining and finish. There are about a zillion variants, which only a collector will love, such as dragoons, M44 carbines, Chinese and Polish models, and so on. The Finnish models are a specialty among collectors, and usually superior to the Russian Nagants. As for a sniper model, a real one is very rare and very dear. There are many fake snipers floating around, and you can buy a nice newly made PU scope and mounting hardware, do some work and have a fun rifle, but the real snipers were hand selected and exceptional weapons. Things to look for are a good bore, good stock, and matching serial numbers on the bolt, magazine plate, and butt plate. You will find some that are forced matched, which is fine too. The two big varients are round reciever and octagonal reciever, and both are good shooters. The octagonal ones are probably a bit nicer, but dont worry too much about that, either will do. http:// 7.62x54r.net is my favorite Nagant site. Enjoy it, and if you get the rifle, I think you will be pleased.",

He badmouthed the Soviet Nagant as if they personally hated him, the quality of the Soviet steel, the T-34 as an inferior battle tank, and so on. It was pretty tiresome, and clearly ideology-driven. When you consider the primitive conditions the Soviet factory system worked under as the war ground on with the Germans, it is a wonder what they did, and I thus consider the Nagant far superior to the K98 in that respect. Same with Russian tanks \u2013 as fine a weapon as the Panzers and Panthers etc. were, the T-34 was probably the finest battle tank in WWII, including our own Zippos. The Red Army functioned under conditions that we can hardly imagine, and they were the ones who really broke the back of Nazi Germany, not the US, not Great Britain, not Canada, not France, and so on. And they lost so many people, civilian and military, it is almost hard to imagine. How would the will of the US people have fared if we had lost 5 or 10 or 15 million soldiers and citizens during WWII? I suspect we would have turned back to the bad old days of isolationism and probably still be in that mindset. Part of the fun of the Nagants is how they were used and why they were manufactured the way they were. Once you start understanding what they represent, they become much more than just old bolt action rifles. Mausers are undoubtedly more accurate overall, and elegant, but the typical Red soldier did very well with this old design. How many more US troops would have died between 1941 and 1945 if it wasn\u2019t for the Red Army and Air Force? A lot more, I imagine, which is something I remember when I take mine out to the range. Forget the politics \u2013 just as the ordinary German was not a Nazi, the ordinary Russian was not a member of the Communist Party. It is a shame the Soviets don\u2019t get the credit in this country they deserve for beating Hitler. The US didn\u2019t beat Germany single-handedly, though far too many actually believe that. quote: Originally posted by Ira1945: for what it is , yes it was made to fight in a war, where five men sent to front with only three rifles, the other two waited for one of the rifle carriers to get whacked.. terrible safety, in essence no safety, carbine very loud, rifle fairly accurate, ammo is cheap but it is all corrosive and the gun has to be cleaned of the salts left from the corrosive primers used. Russia dumped these on the gun market for cash dollars. would not want to make a deer rifle out of it get it, shoot it, clean it with soap and water(best way to beat crappy corrosive primers) oil it and stick it in the closet want a real rifle, get a M1, or 03 or 03A3, or SMLE or M1A, some nice mausers still floating around, might even find a bring back souvenir what do you want, a good war rifle??",
