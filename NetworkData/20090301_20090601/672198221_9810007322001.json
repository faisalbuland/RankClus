Do I feel bad that \"good\" credit card users whose rates will be hiked up? Perhaps a little bit. But seriously people... do you think you get something for nothing? The way we use credit cards in today's society is insane. I'd be happy to see people completely get away from credit cards. Screw the skymiles. The \"rewards\" come out of something else.

On the personal side of the business of employers checking credit scores, I believe its all about one question: \"where's the money\"? That is why when College graduates look for work in big law firms, you must have graduated from an ABA approved law school; not necessarily because the education was better, but because they are more expensive. Again: Where is the money, employers want to know. And when College graduates look for work, the College graduate who graduated from a big University with no financial aid packages will get the job.

So my mother owned one credit card that she almost never used, and I took it one step further. I've NEVER owned a credit card. The only debt I've ever had was student loans, which are almost paid off and were never late. I bought my cars in cash, and I won't buy a home until I can cover most of it in a down payment. Do I feel bad that \"good\" credit card users whose rates will be hiked up? Perhaps a little bit. But seriously people... do you think you get something for nothing? The way we use credit cards in today's society is insane. I'd be happy to see people completely get away from credit cards. Screw the skymiles. The \"rewards\" come out of something else. This is a closed system (a big one, yes, but still a closed system), and nothing is free. If we're so far gone that people can't survive without credit cards, what does that say about our society?",

Even if the information in the link is true, responsible credit card users still get rewarded in other ways. Employers do credit checks. A credit score of over 700 is not automatic: you must have a history of borrowing, from the bank, paying bills on time, and paying credit card bills on time. So when 2 people have equal qualifications for the job, the person with the credit score of over 700 gets the job. And the person with the lousy credit score doesn't get anything. So, the amount of money you lose by not getting the job will dwarf the amount of money you save as a risky borrower. As an unemployed person with no history of borrowing, no experience in my field of study, I need the credit card companies to raise my credit score. No credit card company will give me a credit card except the ones that charge over 10% interest. I can live with that, as it takes money to make money (I don't mind paying an extra 10% interest in return for the credit score i'll need to get a job). On the personal side of the business of employers checking credit scores, I believe its all about one question: \"where's the money\"? That is why when College graduates look for work in big law firms, you must have graduated from an ABA approved law school; not necessarily because the education was better, but because they are more expensive. Again: Where is the money, employers want to know. And when College graduates look for work, the College graduate who graduated from a big University with no financial aid packages will get the job. Why: because if you graduated from a city public college with financial aid packages, that means you didn't pay for your education, and you have no way of showing employers how you overcome obstacles in life.
