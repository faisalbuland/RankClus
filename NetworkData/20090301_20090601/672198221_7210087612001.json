Look love to see some fiscal restraint (Once the economy is back on track) but lets not act like the GOP was the party of less spending. They ran the Govt with complete control from 2002-2006 in that period they spent more money then any time since WWII. GOP lost a LOT of credibility when it comes to discussions about less spending. If they had found their backbone during the Bush years the American people would take them serious about spending issues. But now it seems like they are the party of obstruction. The American people want ideas and solution not the same ole same ole and \"NO\". In war time obviously there is going to be spending going on. But at a projected 1.9 trillion influx of debt by a DEMOCRATIC controled government has far overshadowed the Republican controlled governmnet you are speaking of. I agree with you Republican's weren't as fiscally conservative during that time period as I would have liked but compared to what is going on now what they spent isn't even a drop in the bucket and makes them all look like fiscal conservatives. Also I did say fiscal conservatives in my previous post. You obviously missed that part. I agree with you during a time of war we do increase spending. But the GOP lost any shred of respectability when it comes to discussion of fiscal responsibility when they enacted TAX CUTS during a time of war. Something that has never happened in history of man. When you have war you increase spending thus you do not decrease the revenue to fund said war. The bare minimum you maintain the same tax or more likely increase taxes to fund the war (or initiate War bonds) The GOP CUT taxes. Which is the height of fiscal irresponsibility especially when it was TWO wars. Having Tax cuts in a time of war is perfectly acceptable if you cut spending elsewhere.....",
