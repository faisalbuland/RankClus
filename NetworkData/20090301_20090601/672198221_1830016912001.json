If the request by Gen. David McKiernan is OK\u2019d by President Barack Obama, it would bring the total U.S. force in Afghanistan to about 78,000 sometime in 2010. That would be an increase of 40,000 troops over the current total. Full report at > The Army Times >http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/04/military_afghanistan_moretroops_040109w/",

The 100th Brigade Support Battalion had been serving in Iraq since December, but was \u201crepositioned\u201d to southern Afghanistan at the end of March, officials said. The shift comes amid a larger change in the focus of U.S. military efforts from Iraq to Afghanistan. Last week, President Barack Obama announced a revamped war strategy, part of which involves sending at least 4,000 additional military trainers to Afghanistan. Obama also had previously announced that 17,000 more U.S. troops would be added in Afghanistan this year. The new strategy also beefs up the number of civilian specialists in the country, along with putting increased emphasis on Pakistan and the tribal areas surrounding the border.
