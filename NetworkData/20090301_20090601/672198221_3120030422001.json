Bobby Jindal had made national headlines by vowing to oppose. Legislation had been offered this session to put Louisianas jobless claims system in a mode that would make the state eligible for the money, but Jindal and his allies bottled up the bills in the House Labor Committee, where Republican opponents hold a majority. To get around that hurdle, Labor Committee Chairman Avon Honey, D-Baton Rouge, brought one of his bills to the House floor late Monday evening while few members were paying close attention. His House Bill 841 originally dealt with workers compensation issues, but he asked for an amendment that made the bill a vehicle for changing state law to take the stimulus money. The bill passed 99-0 without debate and apparently with few if any members noticing Honey's amendment More evidence that most politicians are idiots. The people of Louisiana should be demanding the resignation of every member of the State House who voted for the bill without reading the amendment.",
