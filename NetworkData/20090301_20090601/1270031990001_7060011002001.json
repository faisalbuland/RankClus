Before the great rebellion of the Jews to Roman dominance in about the year 70 CE, there was certainty that Jesus was about to return and suck all good Christians into heaven. Witness the near destruction of the greatest historical advancement of mankind in the year 1497, when Friar Girolamo Savoranola decided to take on the Medici-supported pope of the day and declare the end coming and the need to burn anything humanistic: mirrors, books of science, pictures that showed scenes of pagan activities. Many Sandro Botticelli works were destroyed, some thrown into the so-called Fire of the Vanities by Sandro himself. *****s were hunted down and killed by the church's policemen; indeed, it is said by some that we almost lost Leonardo. Even while Columbus was on the high seas discovering (and pillaging in the name of the Church) new places; even while astronomers were discovering that the world wasn't flat; even while the (evil) art of perspective was coming to two dimensional art; even then were the worlds most forward thinking and inventive people made to think that the new direction they were taking was leading to the destruction of mankind, and, of course, the loss of his soul. Before he was burned at the stake himself, Friar Savonarola laid waste to everything humanistic, including the soul of the man who made the Renaissance possible: Lorenzo de Medici. Rather than allowing Lorenzo forgiveness on his deathbed, Savonarola cursed him and damned him to hell. Apocalyptic prophesy often comes after some sort of human tragedy. Then it was the advent of syphillis, today thought to have been brought from the New World. But in those days, a clever End-Times preacher can work a good tragedy to his advantage: Savonarola took advantage of this and brought culpability and shame into hearts. You see the same thing today. When the stock market took a plunge, people were out with pitchforks, often led by the church. I think it's human nature to think that there must be fault and culpability when anything bad happens, and they want revenge; they want to stamp it out. And people look at themselves and say, \"I (we) must have been bad.\" Then they head to church and bring out Ol' Glory. And they focus on apocalyptic stories. The latest is the end of the Mayan Calendar. ...Now isn't THAT proof that we've been bad and that God is going to come and kick our butts? Never mind that God doesn't believe in the Mayan god. We never learn. History just has to repeat itself, if for no other reason than to entertain us.",

If it is to happen, don't you think He might have at least commented on it...\" Jesus does so in Matthew 24; Mark 13; and Luke 19. Read all three chapters with an open mind to interpretation. The reason that I say this is that many people, when it comes time to interpreting the Scriptures, do so with predestined beliefs and are unwilling to accept what is in plain view. There are two groups of people when it comes to interpreting Scripture. One group, when they see conflicting evidence that is contrary to their beliefs, will not yeild to the truth revealed by the Holy Spirit. The second group are those that are truly seaking for the truth and will yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit and accept the truth of the Holy Scriptures. Matthew 24:37 \"...the coming of the Son of man...\" Jesus' statements concerning \"the coming of the Son of man\" have a double reference: to the first stage of His return at an unknown and unexpected time (i.e., the rapture of the church saints; Mat. 24:42; John 14:3 and to the second stage of His coming after the tribulation, when He will destroy the wicked and gather all the righteous into His kingdom (Rev. 19:11-20:4). We encounter this double reference when Christ describes three different categories of people in His illustration of \"the days of Noe\" (Mat. 24:37-44). These three categories and their relation to Christ's coming are as follows: 1) The tribulation unbelievers, represented by the flood victims of Noah's day. They do not know the time of Christ's return, are unprepared, and are thus destroyed at the end of time (Mat. 24:38-39). This is the second stage of His return, the one occuring after the tribulation. 2) The tribulation believers, represented by Noah. Because of the signs of the end time, tribulation saints know almost the precise time of the Lord's return and are prepared and saved. Christ returns for them at the expected time (Mat. 24:15; Dan. 9:27). This too refers to the second stage of Christ's return. 3) Present-day believers or church saints living before the tribulation, represented by Jesus disciples. They will not know the time of Christ's return to take them to heaven (Mat. 24:42, 44; John 14:3). There will be no definite signs preceding the Lord's return for them, for Christ states that it will occur unexpectedly (Mat. 24:42,44). Notice that Jesus likens the disciples (i.e., church saints) not to Noah (i.e., tribulation believers) but to the flood victims (compare they \"knew not,\" Mat. 24:39 with \"ye know not,\" Mat. 24:42). That is, the church saints will be like the flood victims in one sense: they will not know the time of Christ's return for them and will be surprised when He comes, just as the flood victims did not know the time of the flood and were surprised when it came. Hence, church saints must be ready at any time for the Rapture. Matthew 24:42 \"Watch therefore...\" \"Watch\" (Gk. gregoreo) is a present imperative, indicating a constant vigil at the present time. The reason for this vigil today instead of only in the future is that present-day believers do not know when the Lord will come for them. There will be no warning signs, and they may never assume that He cannot come today. In other words, they must be committed to the historical possibility of Christ returning at any time (Mark 13:33-37). His return for the church is possible any day, impossible no day.

Even while Columbus was on the high seas discovering (and pillaging in the name of the Church) new places; even while astronomers were discovering that the world wasn't flat; even while the (evil) art of perspective was coming to two dimensional art; even then were the worlds most forward thinking and inventive people made to think that the new direction they were taking was leading to the destruction of mankind, and, of course, the loss of his soul. Before he was burned at the stake himself, Friar Savonarola laid waste to everything humanistic, including the soul of the man who made the Renaissance possible: Lorenzo de Medici. Rather than allowing Lorenzo forgiveness on his deathbed, Savonarola cursed him and damned him to hell. Apocalyptic prophesy often comes after some sort of human tragedy. Then it was the advent of syphillis, today thought to have been brought from the New World. But in those days, a clever End-Times preacher can work a good tragedy to his advantage: Savonarola took advantage of this and brought culpability and shame into hearts. You see the same thing today. When the stock market took a plunge, people were out with pitchforks, often led by the church. I think it's human nature to think that there must be fault and culpability when anything bad happens, and they want revenge; they want to stamp it out. And people look at themselves and say, \"I (we) must have been bad.\" Then they head to church and bring out Ol' Glory. And they focus on apocalyptic stories. The latest is the end of the Mayan Calendar. ...Now isn't THAT proof that we've been bad and that God is going to come and kick our butts? Never mind that God doesn't believe in the Mayan god. We never learn. History just has to repeat itself, if for no other reason than to entertain us.",

If it is to happen, don't you think He might have at least commented on it...\" Jesus does so in Matthew 24; Mark 13; and Luke 19. Read all three chapters with an open mind to interpretation. The reason that I say this is that many people, when it comes time to interpreting the Scriptures, do so with predestined beliefs and are unwilling to accept what is in plain view. There are two groups of people when it comes to interpreting Scripture. One group, when they see conflicting evidence that is contrary to their beliefs, will not yeild to the truth revealed by the Holy Spirit. The second group are those that are truly seaking for the truth and will yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit and accept the truth of the Holy Scriptures. Matthew 24:37 \"...the coming of the Son of man...\" Jesus' statements concerning \"the coming of the Son of man\" have a double reference: to the first stage of His return at an unknown and unexpected time (i.e., the rapture of the church saints; Mat. 24:42; John 14:3 and to the second stage of His coming after the tribulation, when He will destroy the wicked and gather all the righteous into His kingdom (Rev. 19:11-20:4). We encounter this double reference when Christ describes three different categories of people in His illustration of \"the days of Noe\" (Mat. 24:37-44). These three categories and their relation to Christ's coming are as follows: 1) The tribulation unbelievers, represented by the flood victims of Noah's day. They do not know the time of Christ's return, are unprepared, and are thus destroyed at the end of time (Mat. 24:38-39). This is the second stage of His return, the one occuring after the tribulation. 2) The tribulation believers, represented by Noah. Because of the signs of the end time, tribulation saints know almost the precise time of the Lord's return and are prepared and saved. Christ returns for them at the expected time (Mat. 24:15; Dan. 9:27). This too refers to the second stage of Christ's return. 3) Present-day believers or church saints living before the tribulation, represented by Jesus disciples. They will not know the time of Christ's return to take them to heaven (Mat. 24:42, 44; John 14:3). There will be no definite signs preceding the Lord's return for them, for Christ states that it will occur unexpectedly (Mat. 24:42,44). Notice that Jesus likens the disciples (i.e., church saints) not to Noah (i.e., tribulation believers) but to the flood victims (compare they \"knew not,\" Mat. 24:39 with \"ye know not,\" Mat. 24:42). That is, the church saints will be like the flood victims in one sense: they will not know the time of Christ's return for them and will be surprised when He comes, just as the flood victims did not know the time of the flood and were surprised when it came. Hence, church saints must be ready at any time for the Rapture. Matthew 24:42 \"Watch therefore...\" \"Watch\" (Gk. gregoreo) is a present imperative, indicating a constant vigil at the present time. The reason for this vigil today instead of only in the future is that present-day believers do not know when the Lord will come for them. There will be no warning signs, and they may never assume that He cannot come today. In other words, they must be committed to the historical possibility of Christ returning at any time (Mark 13:33-37). His return for the church is possible any day, impossible no day.
