The number of young people who will replace them will not be enough to take care of them, especially since Japan does not encourage immigration (for example, children of foreign parents born in Japan, say at a US military base, are not automatically given Japanese citizenship, since those xenophobes love keeping people out- reminds me of certain other posters here who want to limit immigration when North America needs immigration to prevent such a demographic crisis from ever happening). It is because of this that more and more Japanese companies are looking for a robot solution to this that will not only provide Japanese nursing homes with robot attendants to care of the elderly, but possiby also later replace more and more people in the workplace.

Rejecting Immigration, Japan Turns to Technology as Workforce Shrinks A Robotic Solution to an Aging Society? By Blaine Harden Washington Post Foreign Service Monday, January 7, 2008; Page A12 TOKYO -- With a surfeit of the old and a shortage of the young, Japan is on course for a population collapse unlike any in human history. What ails this prosperous nation could be treated with babies and immigrants. Yet many young women here do not want children, and the Japanese will not tolerate a lot of immigrants. So government and industry are marching into the depopulated future with the help of robots -- some with wheels, some with legs, some that you can wear like an overcoat with muscles. A small army of these machines, which has attracted huge and appreciative crowds, is on display this winter at the Great Robot Exhibition in Tokyo's National Museum of Nature and Science. The Japanese are delighted by robots that look human. Honda's ASIMO can dance and serve tea. Toyota has a humanoid robot that plays \"Pomp and Circumstance\" on the violin -- rather robotically. But engineers say it's the \"service robots,\" which can't dance a lick and don't look remotely human, that can bail out Japan, which has the world's largest proportion of residents over 65 and smallest proportion of children under 15. One such gizmo, on display at the show, can spoon-feed the elderly. Others are being designed to hoist them onto a toilet and phone a nurse when they won't take their pills. Toyota, the world's largest car company, announced last month that service robots would soon become one of its core businesses. The government heavily subsidizes development of these machines. Other cheerleaders for robots include universities and much of the news media. Not everyone, though, is cheering. There are critics who describe the robot cure for an aging society as little more than high-tech quackery. They say that robots are a politically expedient palliative that allows politicians and corporate leaders to avoid wrenchingly difficult social issues, such as Japan's deep-seated aversion to immigration, its chronic shortage of affordable day care and Japanese women's increasing rejection of motherhood. \"Robots can be useful, but they cannot come close to overcoming the problem of population decline,\" said Hidenori Sakanaka, former head of the Tokyo Immigration Bureau and now director of the Japan Immigration Policy Institute, a research group in Tokyo. \"The government would do much better spending its money to recruit, educate and nurture immigrants,\" he said. The scale of the coming demographic disaster, assuming present trends continue, is without precedent, according to Sakanaka and many other analysts. Population shrinkage began here three years ago and is gathering pace. Within 50 years, the population, now 127 million, will fall by a third, the government projects. Within a century, two-thirds of the population will be gone. That would leave Japan, now the world's second-largest economy, with about 42 million people.
