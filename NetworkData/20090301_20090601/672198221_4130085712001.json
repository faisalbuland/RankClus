Have the military going to a digital database for medical records been beat to death here on mil.com yet? If not, why not? Military Medical Records Go Paperless Story Number: NNS050627-02 Release Date: 6/27/2005 11:23:00 AM By Ellen Maurer, National Naval Medical Center Public Affairs BETHESDA, Md. (NNS) -- A Defense Department initiative to transition patient records from paper to a new digital health care database is scheduled to begin at the National Naval Medical Center Sept. 18. The new system, known as the Composite Health Care System II (CHCSII), is an upgraded version of the original CHCS program used by military health care providers for more than a decade. CHCSII will allow medical personnel to enter patient information directly into an electronic medical record without needing to first handwrite the record of the visit. CHCSII will maintain the digital information in a centralized database, creating a comprehensive, life-long, computer-based patient record for each and every military health beneficiary. Furthermore, since the program acts as a database, hospital functions like laboratory, radiology and pathology test results will be faster. CHCSII will also improve patient safety through automatic alerts of potential allergic reactions and drug-to-drug interactions. \"CHCSII implementation at our medical center is an exciting endeavor that will keep our staff functioning on the cutting edge of technology,\" said Capt. Mark Olesen, National Naval Medical Center's deputy commander. \"This is a great change for our staff and patients, because it propels us into the future of medicine, which is a world of immediate digital access, virtually unlimited and everlasting information storage capacity, and world-wide connectivity.\" Although CHCSII will not immediately eliminate the use of paper records, as hospital officials point out, it is the first step toward a more efficient and integrated Navy Medicine. \"The Navy currently maintains more than 500 military treatment facilities throughout the fleet; each with their own paper records keeping department. CHCSII will connect us all to each other with the click of a keypad,\" said Capt. Kenneth Senn, CHCSII project officer at the hospital. \"Eventually, after CHCSII is implemented worldwide, a sick or injured Sailor treated on a ship halfway around the world can be transferred to Bethesda and all of his medical information is accessible -- even if he didn't have time to grab his paper record.\" While the new system will benefit Navy Medicine, CHCSII is not a sea service specific initiative and is, in fact, designed to improve joint military medical operations. Proponents of the program have said CHCSII will improve interoperability between the branch services' health care systems through the use of one centralized system instead of the current separate medical structures for each branch. \"Enterprise-wide implementation of this system will support the commitment of the Defense Department to conduct population health management throughout the [Military Health System],\" Senn said. Bethesda is not the first site to transition to CHCSII. Several other military medical facilities have already undergone implantation, including Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. Naval Medical Center San Diego is currently in its CHCSII implementation process. Bethesda's phase-in of CHCSII, which starts this fall, will involve installation of new computer systems and software in all of the hospital's outpatient clinics. The new program will also require hands-on and lecture training for all clinicians who currently work with patients or paper records. \"[The hospital] does have a plan for an extended training period during this transition,\" said Steve Kelley, a CHCSII training project coordinator with the Staff Education and Training department. \"This training is not only mandatory, it is essential to knowing how to effectively and efficiently use this new electronic medical records technology.\" Navy article. Also, doctors, at least at the clinic I use, are now required to input patients visits themselves now via computer. No more speaking into the recorders and then having your medical records updated via a transcriptionist. Any one else that uses clinics noticed this?",

The primary purpose of this position is to aid the Secretary of HHS in achieving the President\u2019s Goal for most Americans to have access to an interoperable electronic medical record by 2014. http://www.hhs.gov/healthit/onc/background/ quote: Executive Order: Incentives for the Use of Health Information Technology and Establishing the Position of the National Health Information Technology Coordinator Sec. 2.

In fulfilling its responsibilities, the work of the National Coordinator shall be consistent with a vision of developing a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure that: (a) Ensures that appropriate information to guide medical decisions is available at the time and place of care; (b) Improves health care quality, reduces medical errors, and advances the delivery of appropriate, evidence-based medical care; (c) Reduces health care costs resulting from inefficiency, medical errors, inappropriate care, and incomplete information; (d) Promotes a more effective marketplace, greater competition, and increased choice through the wider availability of accurate information on health care costs, quality, and outcomes; (e) Improves the coordination of care and information among hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, and other ambulatory care providers through an effective infrastructure for the secure and authorized exchange of health care information; and (f) Ensures that patients' individually identifiable health information is secure and protected. Sec. 3. Responsibilities of the National Health Information Technology Coordinator. (a) The National Coordinator shall, to the extent permitted by law, develop, maintain, and direct the implementation of a strategic plan to guide the nationwide implementation of interoperable health information technology in both the public and private health care sectors that will reduce medical errors, improve quality, and produce greater value for health care expenditures. The National Coordinator shall report to the Secretary regarding progress on the development and implementation of the strategic plan within 90 days after the National Coordinator begins operations and periodically thereafter. The plan shall: (i) Advance the development, adoption, and implementation of health care information technology standards nationally through collaboration among public and private interests, and consistent with current efforts to set health information technology standards for use by the Federal Government; (ii) Ensure that key technical, scientific, economic, and other issues affecting the public and private adoption of health information technology are addressed; (iii) Evaluate evidence on the benefits and costs of interoperable health information technology and assess to whom these benefits and costs accrue; (iv) Address privacy and security issues related to interoperable health information technology and recommend methods to ensure appropriate authorization, authentication, and encryption of data for transmission over the Internet; (v) Not assume or rely upon additional Federal resources or spending to accomplish adoption of interoperable health information technology; and (vi) Include measurable outcome goals.

The machine cannot close the file or assign any points to your license till everything is exact. That could take years and cause errors in the system and keep your insurance rates from increasing or in the event of another speeding ticket the revocation of your license since the records would show no prior points.",
