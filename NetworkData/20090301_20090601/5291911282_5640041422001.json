The answer till this point has never been revealed. I spoke with the woodchuck guild and they said they were prepared to release the figure since technology has made this information null and void for any competition to use it to their benefit. The beaver guild is furious because they being the curmudgeons they are won't embrace the technology and make their lives a little easier. They claim that the release of this information could harm their production quotas. Using a little math, any new competition who came into woods would be able to use those figures, to create their own guild or union. Sorry Beavers but here it is. How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? It has been analyzed and the answer is: Average amount of wood a woodchuck would chuck in a given day 948 butt cords of wood. Median amount of wood a woodchuck could chuck in a given hour 9 butt cords of wood. Record one day high for woodchuck wood chucking of 2679 butt cords was attained on 6/15/1996 . Now you know...
