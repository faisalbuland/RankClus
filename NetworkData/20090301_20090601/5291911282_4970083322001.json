The price Was...$595.00 Price Now...$545.00 I am eligible for a 15% discount which would put my cost at $463.25. IS THIS A GOOD CAMERA? I am not an expert but I have been using an Olympus C-4000 digital for about six years. Mostly take pictures of my grand children. My youngest grandson (2 yo) won't stay still long enough to get a decent shot. I want to be able to take quick action shots and of course I 'd like good clarity and red eye elimination. Is this the best value? Anyone know of a better deal? They also have an Olympus E-520 10MP Digital SLR Camera w/ 14-42mm Lens, 40-150mm Lens & 1GB XD Card Price...$649.00 Is this a better deal? You get two lens. P.S. I was mailed a postcard from the all service exchange with the following code for a 15% discount. 951pcr3 Some restrictions apply. If you are thinking of using AAFES try the code, hopefully it will save you a few bucks! Bob T",

I'm not a professional photographer, but I have done some modeling and to be honest, an expensive camera like that to take pictures of the Grandkids is nice, but not necessary. Personally, I'd go with a Canon Powershot SD780 IS... they're small, and great for snapping pictures of the kids running around.",

There is no memory card in it so you will have to buy one. Then you will have to get a case, a filter, etc.. Look at the local camera shops around you and see if they are offering a deal where you can get everything for a little bit more, including the next zoom lens up. I talked about this with several people before buying and some of the guys are know are in Public Relations for the military. They use Nikon cameras, the D60, D80, etc... plus they use their own Nikons for personal use and love them. They say they are the easiest to find things for.",

Contax-Yashica w/Carl Zeiss Planar lenses are right up there with Nikon as well! I got into SLR (35-mm film) Photography back in the 70's and was an absolute fanatic about it! I had two SLR's at all times and it was not uncommon for me to shoot 100-frames per day for months on end; I was satisfied if I got one really decent frame per 100-shots, but not surprised if it took a half-dozen rolls to get it! I fell away from it for several years, but last year I bought a Canon Rebel XL DSLR; not top of the line by any means, but certainly good enough to get my hand back in and also enable me to advise my customers as to Digital Photography and how it relates to their computers in general terms. Still great fun, and the near instant gratification is nice too. It is not our belief or disbelief that can make or unmake the fact. ~ Thomas Paine",
