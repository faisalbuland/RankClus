May 26, 2009 10:07 pm US/Central Supervisor Asks Woman To Take Down American Flag Reporting Carol Cavazos MANSFIELD (CBS 11 News) \u2015 Is it okay to show your patriotism at the office? For one Arlington woman, the answer was \"no\" after she hung an American flag in her office just before the Memorial Day weekend. Debbie McLucas is one of four hospital supervisors at Kindred Hospital in Mansfield. Last week, she hung a three-by-five foot American flag in the office she shares with the other supervisors. When McLucas came to work Friday, her boss told her another supervisor had found her flag offensive. \"I was just totally speechless. I was like, 'You're kidding me,'\" McLucas said. McLucas' husband and sons are former military men. Her daughter is currently serving in Iraq as a combat medic. Stifling a cry, McLucas said, \"I just wonder if all those young men and women over there are really doing this for nothing.\" McLucas said the supervisor who complained has been in the United States for 14 years and is formerly from Africa. McLucas said the supervisor took down Debbie's flag herself. \"The flag and the pole had been placed on the floor,\" McLucas said. But McLucas also said hospital higher ups had told her some patients' families and visitors had also complained. \"I was told it wouldn't matter if it was only one person,\" she said. \"It would have to come down.\" McLucas said hospital bosses told her as far as patriotism was concerned, the flag flying outside the hospital building would have to suffice. Kindred Hospital Corporate Headquarters are located in Kentucky. They have yet to make a final decision on the matter. They have not returned our phone calls for comment. The Kindred Hospital Corporation was chosen as Fortune's most admired for 2009. McLucas hopes they'll back her patriotism. \"I find it very frightening because if I can't display my flag, what other freedoms will I lose before all is said and done,\" McLucas asked. (\u00a9 MMIX, CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.) They do not allow the American Flag to be displayed by employees This is the response that I sent them, feel free to use it........ Do you forget where you are located?? A M E R I C A The american flag is a right and if it offends someone F I R E T H E M. They shouldn't be here. You make me sick and you spit on the bodies of our dead American heroes. You should be ashamed of yourselves!!

'04, after my accident and going through the process of having my left leg rebuilt, I had already spent 2 full months in an ICU in Orlando's Florida Hospital. They sent me to Kindred.... 1) I arrived via transport ambulance and the EMT's and I sat there in the room for over 30 minutes waiting for someone....anyone, to come in and check me in. Three women were goofing off joking at the desk. 2) My pain meds were constantly late. At one time, two hours late. It was Dilaudid (a type of morphine) that I was more than ready for an hour or two before each dose. 3) I got sick on my meds and tossed up breakfast all over myself. They gave me a towel. I asked for a tub of warm water and soap. I was told my bath was not scheduled until that evening and I would have to wait. That evening, a woman came in at 11:30 p.m. and woke me up for my bath. \"Get the hell out of here!!!\" I don't like to give problems to those who are not at fault but I was highly upset. 4) Two of my coworkers, U.S. Customs Officers came in uniform to visit me. Some supervisor Admin woman came in and told them they could not wear their firearms in the hospital. I sure as heck set her straight. \"These are Federal Officers on duty. Would you tell a Pinellas County Deputy not to wear his firearm in the hospital?!?!\" She backed off. I had a meeting with several of the Directors there and told them how screwed up their hospital was. I said, \"Here I am a 40 yr old man who has to make a scene to get his meds, etc, on time. How the heck do these patients in their 80's and 90's defend for themselves???\" After about a week, I went back to Orlando for my final skin graph. When they were finished, a doctor told me, \"You should be out of here in a couple of hours.\" I said, \"Out of here, out of here where?\" He said, \"Back to wherever you were.\" \"No freaking way!\", I said. Luckily I had a friend who had the same family doctor as I did. She made some calls and got me into Mease Hospital instead. Man, that place was such an improvement over Kindred. Don",

McLucas did not return phone calls from The Dallas Morning News on Wednesday but she told her story on KRLD radio\u2019s early-morning talk show. She said her husband spent 24 years in the U.S. Army. One son is an ex-Marine and a second son is an Army veteran. A daughter is a combat medic serving in Iraq. So, as a patriotic American and with Memorial Day approaching, McLucas decided last week to mount a 3-foot-by-five-foot American flag on the wall of an office she shares with three other supervisors at Kindred Hospital. McLucas said she got to work on Friday and found the flag had been taken down because another supervisor had complained that the display was offensive. The complaining employee is an African immigrant who has lived in the United States for 14 years, McLucas said. \"The other supervisor took it down unknown to me because I wasn\u2019t at work that day, and it\u2019s when I returned to work last Friday that I was told it was taken down because it was offensive,\" McLucas said during the interview on KRLD. The Kindred Hospital press release said the company is working to resolve this \"isolated incident between two employees.\" Rhonda Williams, hospital administrator, said McLucas was not at work Wednesday but has accepted the offer to remount the flag on the office wall.

For one Arlington woman, the answer was \"no\" after she hung an American flag in her office just before the Memorial Day weekend. Debbie McLucas is one of four hospital supervisors at Kindred Hospital in Mansfield. Last week, she hung a three-by-five foot American flag in the office she shares with the other supervisors. When McLucas came to work Friday, her boss told her another supervisor had found her flag offensive. \"I was just totally speechless. I was like, 'You're kidding me,'\" McLucas said. McLucas' husband and sons are former military men. Her daughter is currently serving in Iraq as a combat medic. Stifling a cry, McLucas said, \"I just wonder if all those young men and women over there are really doing this for nothing.\" McLucas said the supervisor who complained has been in the United States for 14 years and is formerly from Africa. McLucas said the supervisor took down Debbie's flag herself. \"The flag and the pole had been placed on the floor,\" McLucas said. But McLucas also said hospital higher ups had told her some patients' families and visitors had also complained. \"I was told it wouldn't matter if it was only one person,\" she said. \"It would have to come down.\" McLucas said hospital bosses told her as far as patriotism was concerned, the flag flying outside the hospital building would have to suffice. Kindred Hospital Corporate Headquarters are located in Kentucky. They have yet to make a final decision on the matter. They have not returned our phone calls for comment. The Kindred Hospital Corporation was chosen as Fortune's most admired for 2009. McLucas hopes they'll back her patriotism. \"I find it very frightening because if I can't display my flag, what other freedoms will I lose before all is said and done,\" McLucas asked.

'04, after my accident and going through the process of having my left leg rebuilt, I had already spent 2 full months in an ICU in Orlando's Florida Hospital. They sent me to Kindred.... 1) I arrived via transport ambulance and the EMT's and I sat there in the room for over 30 minutes waiting for someone....anyone, to come in and check me in. Three women were goofing off joking at the desk. 2) My pain meds were constantly late. At one time, two hours late. It was Dilaudid (a type of morphine) that I was more than ready for an hour or two before each dose. 3) I got sick on my meds and tossed up breakfast all over myself. They gave me a towel. I asked for a tub of warm water and soap. I was told my bath was not scheduled until that evening and I would have to wait. That evening, a woman came in at 11:30 p.m. and woke me up for my bath. \"Get the hell out of here!!!\" I don't like to give problems to those who are not at fault but I was highly upset. 4) Two of my coworkers, U.S. Customs Officers came in uniform to visit me. Some supervisor Admin woman came in and told them they could not wear their firearms in the hospital. I sure as heck set her straight. \"These are Federal Officers on duty. Would you tell a Pinellas County Deputy not to wear his firearm in the hospital?!?!\" She backed off. I had a meeting with several of the Directors there and told them how screwed up their hospital was. I said, \"Here I am a 40 yr old man who has to make a scene to get his meds, etc, on time. How the heck do these patients in their 80's and 90's defend for themselves???\" After about a week, I went back to Orlando for my final skin graph. When they were finished, a doctor told me, \"You should be out of here in a couple of hours.\" I said, \"Out of here, out of here where?\" He said, \"Back to wherever you were.\" \"No freaking way!\", I said. Luckily I had a friend who had the same family doctor as I did. She made some calls and got me into Mease Hospital instead. Man, that place was such an improvement over Kindred. Don",

After a thorough roasting in the blogosphere, Kindred officials decided to let hospital supervisor Debbie McLucas put an American flag back on her office wall. Also Online Get Tarrant County news and resources \"We have invited the employee (McLucas) to put the flag back up,\" Kindred said in a brief press release. McLucas did not return phone calls from The Dallas Morning News on Wednesday but she told her story on KRLD radio\u2019s early-morning talk show. She said her husband spent 24 years in the U.S. Army. One son is an ex-Marine and a second son is an Army veteran. A daughter is a combat medic serving in Iraq. So, as a patriotic American and with Memorial Day approaching, McLucas decided last week to mount a 3-foot-by-five-foot American flag on the wall of an office she shares with three other supervisors at Kindred Hospital. McLucas said she got to work on Friday and found the flag had been taken down because another supervisor had complained that the display was offensive. The complaining employee is an African immigrant who has lived in the United States for 14 years, McLucas said. \"The other supervisor took it down unknown to me because I wasn\u2019t at work that day, and it\u2019s when I returned to work last Friday that I was told it was taken down because it was offensive,\" McLucas said during the interview on KRLD. The Kindred Hospital press release said the company is working to resolve this \"isolated incident between two employees.\" Rhonda Williams, hospital administrator, said McLucas was not at work Wednesday but has accepted the offer to remount the flag on the office wall.

If some arrogant, unappreciative, biased, clearly unpatriotic, 'lost' foreigner or anyone else has 'issues' with it, I suggest they catch the next flight or boat/ship out of here, right back to TimBukTu or wherever, where they obviously will fit in better than they ever will or should fit in here. It's high time we lay down the law and throw down a major legal gauntlet for all these whining, crybaby liberal, \"offended by a gnat\" ne'er-do-wells who come here to the U.S, and want to greedily suck on the breast of the generosity of the rest of us, while petulantly pitching fits about anything and everything \"American\", because they \"just don't like it\". GTHO, and you all know what the heck that means! These blatantly UNGRATEFUL losers make me sick, mad and very frustrated by their sheer arrogance and gross ignorance combined! If WE were to try this SAME kind of stunt elsewhere, we'd be held fully accountable, occupying a filthy jail or prison cell somewhere, while we mulled and reconsidered the unwelcome sheer stupidity and arrogance of our actions! That's the reality. Why doesn't someone press some formal charges against the 'offended' party and/or the other equally biased malingerers among the hospital staff? Better yet, BLACKBALL the hospital and its clearly unpatriotic operators/owners...get the word out about how greedy and unpatriotic this hospital is...empty their beds, and hit 'em right square on their BOTTOM LINE...see how they do with NO business, especially patriotic civilian, military and veteran patients, if the hospital staff/admin folks abhor and detest this country and its people so much! Send 'em all packing! Get them all the heck out of here...make room for far more respectful, properly decent and appreciative, patriotic businesses. GET TOUGH, or GET OUT OF THE WAY! Enough of this liberal \"P.C.\" nonsense. Our veterans and military service personnel, and our flag, deserve FAR BETTER than some unkind, unappreciative, pitiful and obviously LOST foreign person and/or others of that sorry ilk. LEAVE, and DON'T EVEN THINK OF COMING BACK HERE! \"ASSIMILATE, or, THERE'S THE GATE!\" When are we as Americans going to step up to the plate unapologetically, and MAKE A SERIOUS and SUBSTANTIAL STAND for ourselves and our own country? No one else CAN or WILL do it for us, nor should they have to! It's up to US-IT'S OUR CALL! Kindred Hospital(s), you are being put ON NOTICE that you better choose whose side you are on. We are watching and waiting. This is not 'over' by a long shot. The wrong-headed, defective corporate policy that allowed this to happen MUST be addressed and corrected, and the individual(s) who \"took offense\" need to be FIRED or get some serious reorientation and study classes/sessions.

        "reply": "MM2 Lewis...the display of the nation's RECOGNIZED, AUTHORIZED, LEGITIMATE FLAG IN an American hospital should NEVER, EVER, EVER, IN ANY WAY be considered by ANYONE to be \"offensive\" no matter what the size may be. If some arrogant, unappreciative, biased, clearly unpatriotic, 'lost' foreigner or anyone else has 'issues' with it, I suggest they catch the next flight or boat/ship out of here, right back to TimBukTu or wherever, where they obviously will fit in better than they ever will or should fit in here. It's high time we lay down the law and throw down a major legal gauntlet for all these whining, crybaby liberal, \"offended by a gnat\" ne'er-do-wells who come here to the U.S, and want to greedily suck on the breast of the generosity of the rest of us, while petulantly pitching fits about anything and everything \"American\", because they \"just don't like it\". GTHO, and you all know what the heck that means! These blatantly UNGRATEFUL losers make me sick, mad and very frustrated by their sheer arrogance and gross ignorance combined! If WE were to try this SAME kind of stunt elsewhere, we'd be held fully accountable, occupying a filthy jail or prison cell somewhere, while we mulled and reconsidered the unwelcome sheer stupidity and arrogance of our actions! That's the reality. Why doesn't someone press some formal charges against the 'offended' party and/or the other equally biased malingerers among the hospital staff? Better yet, BLACKBALL the hospital and its clearly unpatriotic operators/owners...get the word out about how greedy and unpatriotic this hospital is...empty their beds, and hit 'em right square on their BOTTOM LINE...see how they do with NO business, especially patriotic civilian, military and veteran patients, if the hospital staff/admin folks abhor and detest this country and its people so much! Send 'em all packing! Get them all the heck out of here...make room for far more respectful, properly decent and appreciative, patriotic businesses. GET TOUGH, or GET OUT OF THE WAY! Enough of this liberal \"P.C.\" nonsense. Our veterans and military service personnel, and our flag, deserve FAR BETTER than some unkind, unappreciative, pitiful and obviously LOST foreign person and/or others of that sorry ilk. LEAVE, and DON'T EVEN THINK OF COMING BACK HERE! \"ASSIMILATE, or, THERE'S THE GATE!\" When are we as Americans going to step up to the plate unapologetically, and MAKE A SERIOUS and SUBSTANTIAL STAND for ourselves and our own country? No one else CAN or WILL do it for us, nor should they have to! It's up to US-IT'S OUR CALL! Kindred Hospital(s), you are being put ON NOTICE that you better choose whose side you are on. We are watching and waiting. This is not 'over' by a long shot. The wrong-headed, defective corporate policy that allowed this to happen MUST be addressed and corrected, and the individual(s) who \"took offense\" need to be FIRED or get some serious reorientation and study classes/sessions.

May 26, 2009 10:07 pm US/Central Supervisor Asks Woman To Take Down American Flag Reporting Carol Cavazos MANSFIELD (CBS 11 News) \u2015 Is it okay to show your patriotism at the office? For one Arlington woman, the answer was \"no\" after she hung an American flag in her office just before the Memorial Day weekend. Debbie McLucas is one of four hospital supervisors at Kindred Hospital in Mansfield. Last week, she hung a three-by-five foot American flag in the office she shares with the other supervisors. When McLucas came to work Friday, her boss told her another supervisor had found her flag offensive. \"I was just totally speechless. I was like, 'You're kidding me,'\" McLucas said. McLucas' husband and sons are former military men. Her daughter is currently serving in Iraq as a combat medic. Stifling a cry, McLucas said, \"I just wonder if all those young men and women over there are really doing this for nothing.\" McLucas said the supervisor who complained has been in the United States for 14 years and is formerly from Africa. McLucas said the supervisor took down Debbie's flag herself. \"The flag and the pole had been placed on the floor,\" McLucas said. But McLucas also said hospital higher ups had told her some patients' families and visitors had also complained. \"I was told it wouldn't matter if it was only one person,\" she said. \"It would have to come down.\" McLucas said hospital bosses told her as far as patriotism was concerned, the flag flying outside the hospital building would have to suffice. Kindred Hospital Corporate Headquarters are located in Kentucky. They have yet to make a final decision on the matter. They have not returned our phone calls for comment. The Kindred Hospital Corporation was chosen as Fortune's most admired for 2009. McLucas hopes they'll back her patriotism. \"I find it very frightening because if I can't display my flag, what other freedoms will I lose before all is said and done,\" McLucas asked.

They sent me to Kindred.... 1) I arrived via transport ambulance and the EMT's and I sat there in the room for over 30 minutes waiting for someone....anyone, to come in and check me in. Three women were goofing off joking at the desk. 2) My pain meds were constantly late. At one time, two hours late. It was Dilaudid (a type of morphine) that I was more than ready for an hour or two before each dose. 3) I got sick on my meds and tossed up breakfast all over myself. They gave me a towel. I asked for a tub of warm water and soap. I was told my bath was not scheduled until that evening and I would have to wait. That evening, a woman came in at 11:30 p.m. and woke me up for my bath. \"Get the hell out of here!!!\" I don't like to give problems to those who are not at fault but I was highly upset. 4) Two of my coworkers, U.S. Customs Officers came in uniform to visit me. Some supervisor Admin woman came in and told them they could not wear their firearms in the hospital. I sure as heck set her straight. \"These are Federal Officers on duty. Would you tell a Pinellas County Deputy not to wear his firearm in the hospital?!?!\" She backed off. I had a meeting with several of the Directors there and told them how screwed up their hospital was. I said, \"Here I am a 40 yr old man who has to make a scene to get his meds, etc, on time. How the heck do these patients in their 80's and 90's defend for themselves???\" After about a week, I went back to Orlando for my final skin graph.

After a thorough roasting in the blogosphere, Kindred officials decided to let hospital supervisor Debbie McLucas put an American flag back on her office wall. Also Online Get Tarrant County news and resources \"We have invited the employee (McLucas) to put the flag back up,\" Kindred said in a brief press release. McLucas did not return phone calls from The Dallas Morning News on Wednesday but she told her story on KRLD radio\u2019s early-morning talk show. She said her husband spent 24 years in the U.S. Army. One son is an ex-Marine and a second son is an Army veteran. A daughter is a combat medic serving in Iraq. So, as a patriotic American and with Memorial Day approaching, McLucas decided last week to mount a 3-foot-by-five-foot American flag on the wall of an office she shares with three other supervisors at Kindred Hospital. McLucas said she got to work on Friday and found the flag had been taken down because another supervisor had complained that the display was offensive. The complaining employee is an African immigrant who has lived in the United States for 14 years, McLucas said. \"The other supervisor took it down unknown to me because I wasn\u2019t at work that day, and it\u2019s when I returned to work last Friday that I was told it was taken down because it was offensive,\" McLucas said during the interview on KRLD. The Kindred Hospital press release said the company is working to resolve this \"isolated incident between two employees.\" Rhonda Williams, hospital administrator, said McLucas was not at work Wednesday but has accepted the offer to remount the flag on the office wall.
