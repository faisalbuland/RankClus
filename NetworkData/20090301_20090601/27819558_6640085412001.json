While not a supporter of gay marriage, I do not have a problem with gays being in the military, especially considering they have been and always will be in despite UCMJ. I'm also not foolish to think that gay soldiers would try to rape me in the shower or anything like that. To be honest, it would be a little weird, but nothing too major. As far as gay marriage goes, it is inevitable that it will be allowed eventually. While I'm not a big fan of the idea, it won't rip apart the fabric of reality when it happens. However, with the calls of \"homophobia\" and bigotry as a political tactic in order to support an agenda, I fear that the politically correct environment will become dangerous. Many people use the term \"gay\" as a derogatory word, without necessarily trying say anything about gays in general (Much like people say \"Jesus Christ\" even if they aren't Christian). For instance, if I were to watch a stupid movie, or if someone were to cut me off on the road, I might say, \"Man, that was gay.\" My concern is that, especially in the military, the guys tend to be potty-mouths, and sometimes \"gay humor\" is used. Once gays are able to openly serve in the military (whic I think they should) would there be a backlash of sexual harassment reports, motivated more out of spite rather than actual justice? I can understand why homosexuals who believe in gay marriage would be angry, but will they be able to succeed in their agenda with grace and dignity, or will they continue to hold onto their anger? Especially when the issue of \"hate speech\" is brought up. It worries me to think that I could potentially be punished for saying something like, \"That was gay\". It seems that gays and Christians tend to be perceived enemies of each other. If Christians are bigots for condemning homosexuality, then gays who attack Christianity are also bigots. Being a bigot involves more than hating blacks, gays, and Jews, but people often forget that. I commonly see on posts people who condemn racism, only to call the original poster a Southern hillbilly. Isn't that a form of bigotry in itself to attack all white Southerners like that? I just think people need to realize that everyone is a bigot in some way, and not to be selective as to what kind of disapproval is considered to be bigotry. I just fear that when the day comes when the gays get what they want, which eventually they will, that they will not be content and will try to seek vengeance rather than justice. Well, it looks like I went off on a tangent...oops. Anyway, it's a shame that her service record meant nothing, and that she was discharged. But then, they don't brush their teeth and they kill retarded children in Kansas...I know, since I moved here recently.",
