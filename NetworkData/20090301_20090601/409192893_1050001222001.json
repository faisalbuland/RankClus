Marines then and now call \"The D.I.\" the most accurate portrayal of boot camp training ever put on celluloid. It's also a marvelous character study, with gripping performances by both Webb and Don Dubbins. What makes it even more amazing is: 1) Only three of the men in this film were professional actors; Webb, Dubbins and Lin McCarthy, and Dubbins had been a Marine. All the others were actual Marines, and Webb elicted memorable performances from most of them. 2) It was shot in a breathtaking 23 days in March of 1957. 3) To make the summer release date requested by Warner Bros., Webb edited as he shot. By the time principal photography wrapped, he had two reels cut and scored. \"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050283/\"",

Jack Webb was one of the best. His intensity and desire to 'get the story right' was legion. His 'Dragnet' series was a radio program before it was a TV series, and it earned high marks from the San Francisco PD for its honest and forthright portrayal of police work. Prior to Dragnet, 'paperwork' and 'procedure' were almost unknown on detective shows and movies. Detectives and police ran around with guns drawn and shot it out with bad guys. Credit Jack Webb for changing that model and making police dramas more realistic and thought provoking. He brought that same method to his classic about the Marine Corps. Nearly every scene was taken from interviews of actual DIs that Jack brought in as advisors for the movie. Not that I appreciated it at the time I saw it.

Jack Webb was one of the best. His intensity and desire to 'get the story right' was legion. His 'Dragnet' series was a radio program before it was a TV series, and it earned high marks from the San Francisco PD for its honest and forthright portrayal of police work. Prior to Dragnet, 'paperwork' and 'procedure' were almost unknown on detective shows and movies. Detectives and police ran around with guns drawn and shot it out with bad guys. Credit Jack Webb for changing that model and making police dramas more realistic and thought provoking. He brought that same method to his classic about the Marine Corps. Nearly every scene was taken from interviews of actual DIs that Jack brought in as advisors for the movie. Not that I appreciated it at the time I saw it. My thoughts at the time centered on \"What the h3ll have I gotten myself in to?\" Sullivan013",

        "reply": "Scooter, The night before I went to basic (1982), I saw 'The DI' on the late night movie. Not the best choice in terms of quelling the butterflies in my stomach. Jack Webb was one of the best. His intensity and desire to 'get the story right' was legion. His 'Dragnet' series was a radio program before it was a TV series, and it earned high marks from the San Francisco PD for its honest and forthright portrayal of police work. Prior to Dragnet, 'paperwork' and 'procedure' were almost unknown on detective shows and movies. Detectives and police ran around with guns drawn and shot it out with bad guys. Credit Jack Webb for changing that model and making police dramas more realistic and thought provoking. He brought that same method to his classic about the Marine Corps. Nearly every scene was taken from interviews of actual DIs that Jack brought in as advisors for the movie. Not that I appreciated it at the time I saw it. My thoughts at the time centered on \"What the h3ll have I gotten myself in to?\" Sullivan013",

Some of the recruits were already hard as concrete and didn't want to be there so the DS's were afforded all the ammo they needed.

        "reply": "I don't know about now but in the US Army in 1961 a DS could physically kick your butt and they did. When I got to my TOE outfit it so happened that one of my DS's transferred in and became my Plat Daddy. He took one look at me did a double take and said \"Squad leader? Fckin' amazin'\". But we got along fine. Later, while sharing some brewski's, I asked him why he was so hard on me in basic. He told me, \"Some guys you can talk to. Other individuals are like mules. You gotta hit 'em with a plank to get their attention. You were a mule\". Then he took a long swig and added, \"so was I\". It was a draftee army. Some of the recruits were already hard as concrete and didn't want to be there so the DS's were afforded all the ammo they needed. Funny thing is, a lot of the guys who were dragged kicking and screaming into the Military found a home and turned into lifers. It wasn't the demoralized draftee Army we had in the '70's. More like WWII I think.",
