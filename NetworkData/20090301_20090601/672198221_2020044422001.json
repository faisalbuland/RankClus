Kim\u2019s nuclear detonation may put that leverage in play and test its impact on the leadership. China is increasingly frustrated by North Korea\u2019s defiance of United Nations resolutions designed to curb its atomic and missile programs and is worried that a nuclear-armed government in Pyongyang could spark a new arms race in Asia, analysts and a person familiar with the Obama administration\u2019s policy said. Until now, China has rebuffed U.S. and Japanese calls for tougher economic penalties against North Korean leader Kim, agreeing only on narrow UN sanctions aimed at regime-run companies and arms imports. \u201cChina may be reaching a point of understanding that Kim is going too far,\u201d said Dennis Wilder, a former Asia director for the White House National Security Council. Should the Chinese leadership shift against North Korea, it isn\u2019t clear what levers would be used or whether economic clout would translate into political influence over a regime in a possible succession battle, according to the person familiar with administration policy and experts on China and North Korea. By normal measures of economic influence, China has overwhelming and growing power over North Korea. China accounted for 73 percent of North Korea\u2019s international trade last year, up from less than a third in 2003, according to the Seoul-based Korea Trade & Investment Promotion Agency. Oil, Food China supplies 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s oil demand, 80 percent of consumer goods and 45 percent of its food, Dong Yong Seung, a researcher on North Korean issues at the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, said. China didn\u2019t want to use stronger measures in the past out of fear of alienating possible successors to Kim or even sparking the collapse of North Korea, its ally of 60 years, and fomenting a refugee crisis along their 800-mile border. An April 5 rocket launch, the May 25 nuclear detonation and subsequent short-range missile tests may lead China to work more closely with the U.S., the person familiar with U.S. policy said. China\u2019s foreign ministry said the country \u201cresolutely opposes\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear test. On May 25 China agreed with the U.S., Japan and Russia to work toward a UN resolution censuring North Korea for its nuclear test and missile launches. (....) These tests & saber rattling by NK are more of a concern for China then they are for us! Kim might have gone too far this time (test was only 50 miles from the Chinese border), and bit the hand that feeds him. +http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aiq8iNe42T3g&refer=home \"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\" -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
