Specter said his philosophy was more in line now with Democrats than Republicans, who fired back that he was simply bending to the political winds in order to hang on to power.

Specter (who I dislike) is a conservative leaning moderate who for years has been voted into office by a combination of moderate Repubs, Independents and moderate Demos. Many of the moderate Repubs in Pa have left the Repub party so Mr. Specter is hoping that he can get nominated as the Demo party candidate because IF he is on the ticket for the General election he is very likely to win. Th reason for going Demo rather than Independent like Mr. Lieberman is that the Repubs and Demos parties in Pa have made it almost impossible to run for a statewide office as an Independent.",
