Agreeing with you in concept, I still think it is problematic since a complete failure will require coverage of FDIC-insured customer accounts. I recognize that they are two different pockets ... but ultimately they are on the same pair of pants. To the second part of his question, banks are being required to pay interest ... but it is nowhere near the interest being charged by banks on loans and credit cards. One might wish, from a \"fair is fair\" standpoint that the rates were equal ... but that would defeat the prupose of the loans.",
