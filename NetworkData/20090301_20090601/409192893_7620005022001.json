In February 2007, I (and a few thousand others on the internet) read this at TUCC's then official website: \"The Vision Statement of Trinity is based upon the systematized Liberation Theology that started in 1969 with the publication of Dr James H Cone's book, Black Theology and Black Power.\" In that book, Cone said: \"What we need is the divine love as expressed in Black Power, which is the power of Black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject his love...Black Theology will accept only the love of God which participates in the destruction of the White enemy.\" Obama sat in that place for 20 years, along with his wife, and they took their children there. I watched several videos of Wright's \"sermons\" (which came to public attention because the 'church' was selling them commercially) and observed the 'congregation' applauding and cheering through offensive, hate-filled \"sermons.\" Obama gave an interview to old media (which was quickly buried) in which he had said he attended TUCC 'regularly.' His statement that he'd never heard such \"sermons\" before seems highly dubious. Obama left TUCC only because the unpalatable racism and hatred became public.",

That James Cone quote is not even the right quote, yet it's all over the internet. If the quote is racist, why does the right feel the need to change it? \"Black theology cannot accept a view of God which does not represent God as being for oppressed blacks and thus against white oppressors. Living in a world of white oppressors, blacks have no time for a neutral God. The brutalities are too great and the pain too severe, and this means we must know where God is and what God is doing in the revolution. There is no use for a God who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks. We have had too much of white love, the love that tells blacks to turn the other cheek and go the second mile. What we need is the divine love as expressed in black power, which is the power of blacks to destroy their oppressors, here and now, by any means at their disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject God's love.\" [A Black Theology of Liberation, p. 70] James Cone wrote 8 books, yet the only racist comment people can come up with is a small misquoted snippet. I'm sure you all know what kind of times Cone was living in when he wrote those books. Why is there a new thread about Wright anyway? Is this April 2008? Are we going to keep recycling old controversies? How about another new thread about how the Somali pirates are Obama's fault?",

Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject his love...Black Theology will accept only the love of God which participates in the destruction of the White enemy.\" Obama sat in that place for 20 years, along with his wife, and they took their children there. I watched several videos of Wright's \"sermons\" (which came to public attention because the 'church' was selling them commercially) and observed the 'congregation' applauding and cheering through offensive, hate-filled \"sermons.\" Obama gave an interview to old media (which was quickly buried) in which he had said he attended TUCC 'regularly.'

What we need is the divine love as expressed in black power, which is the power of blacks to destroy their oppressors, here and now, by any means at their disposal.

That James Cone quote is not even the right quote, yet it's all over the internet. If the quote is racist, why does the right feel the need to change it? \"Black theology cannot accept a view of God which does not represent God as being for oppressed blacks and thus against white oppressors. Living in a world of white oppressors, blacks have no time for a neutral God. The brutalities are too great and the pain too severe, and this means we must know where God is and what God is doing in the revolution. There is no use for a God who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks. We have had too much of white love, the love that tells blacks to turn the other cheek and go the second mile. What we need is the divine love as expressed in black power, which is the power of blacks to destroy their oppressors, here and now, by any means at their disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject God's love.\" [A Black Theology of Liberation, p. 70] James Cone wrote 8 books, yet the only racist comment people can come up with is a small misquoted snippet. I'm sure you all know what kind of times Cone was living in when he wrote those books. Why is there a new thread about Wright anyway? Is this April 2008? Are we going to keep recycling old controversies? How about another new thread about how the Somali pirates are Obama's fault?",

        "reply": " Every one of Wright's sermons are available on video, yet the only \"racist, hate-filled sermons\" anyone can come up with are the 2 short clips that were shown on Foxnews over and over. That James Cone quote is not even the right quote, yet it's all over the internet. If the quote is racist, why does the right feel the need to change it? \"Black theology cannot accept a view of God which does not represent God as being for oppressed blacks and thus against white oppressors. Living in a world of white oppressors, blacks have no time for a neutral God. The brutalities are too great and the pain too severe, and this means we must know where God is and what God is doing in the revolution. There is no use for a God who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks. We have had too much of white love, the love that tells blacks to turn the other cheek and go the second mile. What we need is the divine love as expressed in black power, which is the power of blacks to destroy their oppressors, here and now, by any means at their disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject God's love.\" [A Black Theology of Liberation, p. 70] James Cone wrote 8 books, yet the only racist comment people can come up with is a small misquoted snippet. I'm sure you all know what kind of times Cone was living in when he wrote those books. Why is there a new thread about Wright anyway? Is this April 2008? Are we going to keep recycling old controversies? How about another new thread about how the Somali pirates are Obama's fault?",

In February 2007, I (and a few thousand others on the internet) read this at TUCC's then official website: \"The Vision Statement of Trinity is based upon the systematized Liberation Theology that started in 1969 with the publication of Dr James H Cone's book, Black Theology and Black Power.\" In that book, Cone said: \"What we need is the divine love as expressed in Black Power, which is the power of Black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal.

If the quote is racist, why does the right feel the need to change it? \"Black theology cannot accept a view of God which does not represent God as being for oppressed blacks and thus against white oppressors. Living in a world of white oppressors, blacks have no time for a neutral God. The brutalities are too great and the pain too severe, and this means we must know where God is and what God is doing in the revolution. There is no use for a God who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks. We have had too much of white love, the love that tells blacks to turn the other cheek and go the second mile. What we need is the divine love as expressed in black power, which is the power of blacks to destroy their oppressors, here and now, by any means at their disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject God's love.\" [A Black Theology of Liberation, p. 70] James Cone wrote 8 books, yet the only racist comment people can come up with is a small misquoted snippet. I'm sure you all know what kind of times Cone was living in when he wrote those books. Why is there a new thread about Wright anyway? Is this April 2008? Are we going to keep recycling old controversies? How about another new thread about how the Somali pirates are Obama's fault?",
