As several here know I spent over thiry years working in the mountains.. one summer afternoon I was sitting on a log making notes on my map and noticed two squirrels, just over there about 10 feet away chasing each other.. Up the tree, down the tree, around and around the tree they went.. It was great fun to watch AND THEN it happened... It appears one of them squirrels was a girl and the other was a boy and the dude caught her at the base of the tree... well that boy squirrel began doing what boys do in that situation... he was just knocking himself out so-to-speak. Now, I was a gum chewer at that time so I took out my gum, rolled it into a ball and let fly. There was no aiming, I just let-r-rip.. and I pegged that dude right in the back of his little head... he made what looked like one huge startled thrust and I am sure the gal's eyes got as big as \"buckwheats\" on Little Rascals... they parted, he going his way and she going hers. And I was in the best of moods the remainder of the day figuring if I wasn't gettin any ether was he... It was truly a \"one in a million\" shot.. right in the back on the head in the middle of him \"doin-the-deed\".. yepper, made my day. One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

        "content": "You asked for it - I have several over half a century, but one really stuck with me. There was a five acre apple orchard near where I live. Dad eventually bought it, because I was in all the time playing, eating apples, etc. He didn't realize stolen apples taste much better than ones you have to work for, but anyway, when I was about 8, I got one of those store-bought slingshots which was basically a piece of stout wire made into a \"Y\" shape with some elastic bands and a piece of leather to complete the thing. Not much to it. So, I headed down towards the orchard for some target practice, picking up a pocket full of pea-gravel from the road-side on the way... Once I got down there, I started \"thwacking\" just about everything (leaves, knot-holes on limbs, apples) with pretty good success....then I see this robin!! The stalk was on!! But the bird was no dummy. He kept flying off down the row two or three trees every time I would start getting in position to try a shot. Finally he landed in the crotch of a large apple tree two trees down from me, and was in a great place for an open shot. The only problem was, the tree between us was so big and so dense, there was no weeds under it to hide my approach. He would see any attempt I made to get closer, and maybe fly clear out of the orchard all together, because we were almost to the end of the row. So I decided if I could lob a rock up and over the tree in between, it might bounce down through the leaves and branches with just enough noise to get the robin to move up in the tree a little, but not frighten it enough to make it fly away. Now, these were very old apple trees, maybe 30 feet high, umbrellaing an area 20-30 feet across. So I put a little piece of pea-gravel in the leather cup, drew the elastics back, and aimed up in the air so the rock would clear the top of the tree and com down in the next, hoping not to shoot too far or too short... I lined up the shot as best I could to were the robin was and let fly - and the little piece of gravel went out of sight... Then I watched and listened for it to come down through the leaves, but nothing... About then, the robin hopped down on the ground into the grass, probably looking for a worm, I thought. So I had my opportunity to sneak closer anyway. Putting the trunk of the interceding tree between me and my prey, I crept forwards in my best \"Tonto\" stalk, then peered around the trunk carefully. Sure enough, I could see the robin on the ground, its wing twitching a little, but it didn't seem like it was chasing worms. In fact the other wign was out flat on the grass!?!?! I thought of taking a shot, but then its head came up, beak open, shuddered a little and flopped over towards the shuddering wing - and I could see the red of blood!! I jumped up and ran over there to the next tree. The robin was dead, and the piece of pea-gravel was sticking out of its eye! WOW! Of course, it was 100% dumb luck. At best, I had only hoped to startle the bird a little and get it to move. It had to have either looked up in the sky or down at the ground with one eye, the way they do - twisting their heads side to side, in order to have an eye skyward when the rock came down.... I just couldn't believe it - like shooting over a house to hit a BB! But from that point on, whether it be BB guns or Tank guns - I had a thirst to shoot straight and true . . . As for the robin, I set him up in the fork of a limb - like and Indian burial . . . As for the story - never told it 'til now. Who in the hell would believe it?? Wandering and Wondering",

The apples would fall on the ground and really weren't good for anything except feedin them to the hogs.

Well, we got the big idea one day to go up in the woods and find a real slender, strong stick and whittle the end to a real sharp point.

Ranchers and farmers would almost buy yer bullets for ya and point ya to the right place, they hated prairie dogs so bad. The critters could clear off new wheat or alfalfa faster than it could poke up - - Anyway, we're out there going for accuracy, and distance. No shots under 100 yards unless it's a called headshot. Ya get two shots for a hit, then it's the other guy's turn. Ya count both shots and hits. Ya step off all long shots. The guy with the most hits in fewest shots wins over all...but the longest shot is definitely bragging rights too. Typical scores after a morning would be 76/94 vs 81/100 Dad usually won. He used a .22-250 with a filed trigger sear. I used a .243 with such a long trigger pull it seemed two-staged, but I was used to it. Both had Leopold 3 x 9 variable scopes and we shot dead rest over the hood of a pickup on a small sand bag.. . But one time we're glassing the distant mounds and I see a dog so far out the heat waves are really distorting it, so I call it. Dad sees it and suggests we move to where we might see more closer, but I want to try it. So he gives the go-ahead. As I dig my feet into the sand and settle in, another one comes up on the mound and flops down - so when I put the crosshairs down, I see them both lying flat sunning like one long one - - Dad says, \"Right or Left?\" as he watches through his binoculars Being a smart azz, I said, \"Both of 'em...\" but I was really aiming at the left one, cuz it was closest. The wind was a little out of the left, so if the bullet drifted, I figured I might get the one on the right - but really expected to miss on the first shot... Because of the distance, I held and inch or two high and started taking up that long trigger pull of the Marlin Mauser action, expecting it to catch a little right before discharge, so I might take another breath to hold BANG! It didn't catch and away went the shot! I saw something flop on the mound and tried desperately to reacquire - - From behind me I hear, \"You got to be kidding! Let's step that off!\" Trying to be casual, I didn't say anything, just put the rifle on safe, slung it and started walking (We always carried our rifles for snakes, and the off chance of having belligerent folk show up) - - Well, we got out to the mound, and there was both dogs, minus their heads! I couldn't believe it! The bullet had flopped them both in opposite directions, but distance wise, they were also about 5 feet apart - - \"We'd better step that back,\" he said and we did, him taking big strides. It was 426 of his big steps, about 435 of mine. He still beat me on totals that day, but I never saw him make a longer shot, and he was the best shot I ever knew personally. My chest stuck out a little as we had hamburgers for lunch, but didn't dare brag about it. Dad was the best shot Dad knew, too; and he hated to be out done with a gun! Figuring that a prairie dog isn't much bigger than your hand when lying out flat - yup...one..or two in a million! Wandering and Wondering",

Ya get two shots for a hit, then it's the other guy's turn. Ya count both shots and hits. Ya step off all long shots. The guy with the most hits in fewest shots wins over all...but the longest shot is definitely bragging rights too. Typical scores after a morning would be 76/94 vs 81/100 Dad usually won. He used a .22-250 with a filed trigger sear. I used a .243 with such a long trigger pull it seemed two-staged, but I was used to it. Both had Leopold 3 x 9 variable scopes and we shot dead rest over the hood of a pickup on a small sand bag.. . But one time we're glassing the distant mounds and I see a dog so far out the heat waves are really distorting it, so I call it. Dad sees it and suggests we move to where we might see more closer, but I want to try it. So he gives the go-ahead. As I dig my feet into the sand and settle in, another one comes up on the mound and flops down - so when I put the crosshairs down, I see them both lying flat sunning like one long one - - Dad says, \"Right or Left?\" as he watches through his binoculars Being a smart azz, I said, \"Both of 'em...\" but I was really aiming at the left one, cuz it was closest. The wind was a little out of the left, so if the bullet drifted, I figured I might get the one on the right - but really expected to miss on the first shot... Because of the distance, I held and inch or two high and started taking up that long trigger pull of the Marlin Mauser action, expecting it to catch a little right before discharge, so I might take another breath to hold BANG! It didn't catch and away went the shot! I saw something flop on the mound and tried desperately to reacquire - - From behind me I hear, \"You got to be kidding! Let's step that off!\" Trying to be casual, I didn't say anything, just put the rifle on safe, slung it and started walking (We always carried our rifles for snakes, and the off chance of having belligerent folk show up) - - Well, we got out to the mound, and there was both dogs, minus their heads! I couldn't believe it! The bullet had flopped them both in opposite directions, but distance wise, they were also about 5 feet apart - - \"We'd better step that back,\" he said and we did, him taking big strides. It was 426 of his big steps, about 435 of mine. He still beat me on totals that day, but I never saw him make a longer shot, and he was the best shot I ever knew personally. My chest stuck out a little as we had hamburgers for lunch, but didn't dare brag about it. Dad was the best shot Dad knew, too; and he hated to be out done with a gun! Figuring that a prairie dog isn't much bigger than your hand when lying out flat - yup...one..or two in a million! Wandering and Wondering",

He said that there was no way I could get his rifle sown that quick so he stepped off about a hundred feet and put a nickel in the fork of a tree about 5 feet off the ground. He poured the powder, rammed home the ball and wadding, and put a cap in place. He said try that.

Here's one for the golfers. Me and a little wrestling coach buddy decided to do dome golfing at one of those gawd-awful courses built up and down the side of a mountain. The wind started blowing hard out of a canyon and all the greens were on a 45 degree angle and fast as crap - CRAP!! He was a pretty good golfer, so he wasn't doing to bad, but I was quadrople doople boogying everything - terrible. We reach the 9th tee and my score is about 130 so I've about had enough anyway, but when we step out on this tee, I see it is elevated about 50-75 feet above this par-4 460 yard fairway, and we got about a 30 knot wind behind us, so I say, \"Darrel, I'm just gona see how far I can hit this thing.\" Now, I'm left handed and have hit many a homerun, but my golf swing absolutely sux, and I usually hit a terrible slice that may head left 100 yards some times, but I just didn't care. We kind survey the place and all the sane players have already left, because of some drizzle, and the only people in sight are just finishing up on the far green, so I tee up, pull out the ole driver, and let her rip with every muscle I had developed with years of powerlifting!! Usually that results in a shank, or a topper, or a snake killer - or a miss - - but this time there was such a solid CRACK it sounded like a pistol shot! And that thing took off at a 45 degree angle and vanished!! Well, we kept watching for it to bounce, but saw nothing, so I figured it went into the orchard on the right... Suddenly, one of the guys on the green jumped and began looking around all over the place, until his eyes finally raised to us 460+ yards away! Then he started waving his fist at us and his partner was kind of restraining him. So I kinda raised my hands up to the clouds and shrugged my shoulders in a visual apology... They then finished out, the guy shook his fist again, then - thank goodness - they left... \"Musta rolled up on the green while he was getting ready to putt,\" Darrel said as he teed up and hit a nice long drive about 200 yards with the wind... Well, we walked kind slow to his ball, to see if the other guys would come back, but they got in their car and left. He hit an iron onto the green, but I couldn't see my ball anywhere. I figured, because they were angry, they may have took it or kicked it into the water, but I didn't care - then we walked up onto the green and there was Darrel's ball alright, but nothing else in sight anywhere, but what was really weird was there where two holes on the green about 3 feet apart - one with a flag and one without - - \"What the hell....!\" Darrel said and he walked over to look. \"Hey, sport, here's yer ball...\" I walked over there, and in a funnel-shaped hole about six inches deep, with bits of green and sand splatter around it - approximately in a place that would have put it right between the two guys that had been playing ahead of us - was a Titlist ball just like the one I'd smacked off the tee way back there!!! \"Geeeeze, that coulda killed one of 'em!\" I said. \"Better fix this hole!\" \"Screw that!\" said Darrel. \"Let's get outta here before they come back with friends or a gun or something!!\" Yup - that's as close as I ever come to making a hole in one - !!

One more: Some jerk in a Corvette was pacing my truck one night on the loop around Indianapolis. He just stayed right there beside me for mile after mile and my lane was about to end. Even though I'd put on my blinker to indicate I needed to get over a lane, he just sat there, smiling. At that moment, I happened to have been chewing about 4 sticks of gum and decided I'd just plaster that on his windshield to get his attention and make a statement, so I rared back and tossed it out the window.

        "reply": "Once, my brother and I were eating lunch in a little Arkansas truck stop. The flies were buzzing around, really irritating me. As I made point by waving my fork, I hit one and knocked it right into my brother's gravy, where it drowned. He has a weak stomach, so that was the end of his lunch. One more: Some jerk in a Corvette was pacing my truck one night on the loop around Indianapolis. He just stayed right there beside me for mile after mile and my lane was about to end. Even though I'd put on my blinker to indicate I needed to get over a lane, he just sat there, smiling. At that moment, I happened to have been chewing about 4 sticks of gum and decided I'd just plaster that on his windshield to get his attention and make a statement, so I rared back and tossed it out the window. I missed the window, but accidently sailed it through his T-Top, where it landed right on top of the gearshift!",

The one you couldn't do again if you tried 3 quintillion times, so lets hear them.. I will start. As several here know I spent over thiry years working in the mountains.. one summer afternoon I was sitting on a log making notes on my map and noticed two squirrels, just over there about 10 feet away chasing each other.. Up the tree, down the tree, around and around the tree they went.. It was great fun to watch AND THEN it happened... It appears one of them squirrels was a girl and the other was a boy and the dude caught her at the base of the tree... well that boy squirrel began doing what boys do in that situation... he was just knocking himself out so-to-speak. Now, I was a gum chewer at that time so I took out my gum, rolled it into a ball and let fly. There was no aiming, I just let-r-rip.. and I pegged that dude right in the back of his little head... he made what looked like one huge startled thrust and I am sure the gal's eyes got as big as \"buckwheats\" on Little Rascals... they parted, he going his way and she going hers. And I was in the best of moods the remainder of the day figuring if I wasn't gettin any ether was he... It was truly a \"one in a million\" shot.. right in the back on the head in the middle of him \"doin-the-deed\".. yepper, made my day. One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

        "content": "You asked for it - I have several over half a century, but one really stuck with me. There was a five acre apple orchard near where I live. Dad eventually bought it, because I was in all the time playing, eating apples, etc. He didn't realize stolen apples taste much better than ones you have to work for, but anyway, when I was about 8, I got one of those store-bought slingshots which was basically a piece of stout wire made into a \"Y\" shape with some elastic bands and a piece of leather to complete the thing. Not much to it. So, I headed down towards the orchard for some target practice, picking up a pocket full of pea-gravel from the road-side on the way... Once I got down there, I started \"thwacking\" just about everything (leaves, knot-holes on limbs, apples) with pretty good success....then I see this robin!! The stalk was on!! But the bird was no dummy. He kept flying off down the row two or three trees every time I would start getting in position to try a shot. Finally he landed in the crotch of a large apple tree two trees down from me, and was in a great place for an open shot. The only problem was, the tree between us was so big and so dense, there was no weeds under it to hide my approach. He would see any attempt I made to get closer, and maybe fly clear out of the orchard all together, because we were almost to the end of the row. So I decided if I could lob a rock up and over the tree in between, it might bounce down through the leaves and branches with just enough noise to get the robin to move up in the tree a little, but not frighten it enough to make it fly away. Now, these were very old apple trees, maybe 30 feet high, umbrellaing an area 20-30 feet across. So I put a little piece of pea-gravel in the leather cup, drew the elastics back, and aimed up in the air so the rock would clear the top of the tree and com down in the next, hoping not to shoot too far or too short... I lined up the shot as best I could to were the robin was and let fly - and the little piece of gravel went out of sight... Then I watched and listened for it to come down through the leaves, but nothing... About then, the robin hopped down on the ground into the grass, probably looking for a worm, I thought. So I had my opportunity to sneak closer anyway. Putting the trunk of the interceding tree between me and my prey, I crept forwards in my best \"Tonto\" stalk, then peered around the trunk carefully. Sure enough, I could see the robin on the ground, its wing twitching a little, but it didn't seem like it was chasing worms. In fact the other wign was out flat on the grass!?!?! I thought of taking a shot, but then its head came up, beak open, shuddered a little and flopped over towards the shuddering wing - and I could see the red of blood!! I jumped up and ran over there to the next tree. The robin was dead, and the piece of pea-gravel was sticking out of its eye! WOW! Of course, it was 100% dumb luck. At best, I had only hoped to startle the bird a little and get it to move. It had to have either looked up in the sky or down at the ground with one eye, the way they do - twisting their heads side to side, in order to have an eye skyward when the rock came down.... I just couldn't believe it - like shooting over a house to hit a BB! But from that point on, whether it be BB guns or Tank guns - I had a thirst to shoot straight and true . . . As for the robin, I set him up in the fork of a limb - like and Indian burial . . . As for the story - never told it 'til now. Who in the hell would believe it?? Wandering and Wondering",

Ranchers and farmers would almost buy yer bullets for ya and point ya to the right place, they hated prairie dogs so bad. The critters could clear off new wheat or alfalfa faster than it could poke up - - Anyway, we're out there going for accuracy, and distance. No shots under 100 yards unless it's a called headshot. Ya get two shots for a hit, then it's the other guy's turn. Ya count both shots and hits. Ya step off all long shots. The guy with the most hits in fewest shots wins over all...but the longest shot is definitely bragging rights too. Typical scores after a morning would be 76/94 vs 81/100 Dad usually won. He used a .22-250 with a filed trigger sear. I used a .243 with such a long trigger pull it seemed two-staged, but I was used to it. Both had Leopold 3 x 9 variable scopes and we shot dead rest over the hood of a pickup on a small sand bag.. . But one time we're glassing the distant mounds and I see a dog so far out the heat waves are really distorting it, so I call it. Dad sees it and suggests we move to where we might see more closer, but I want to try it. So he gives the go-ahead. As I dig my feet into the sand and settle in, another one comes up on the mound and flops down - so when I put the crosshairs down, I see them both lying flat sunning like one long one - - Dad says, \"Right or Left?\" as he watches through his binoculars Being a smart azz, I said, \"Both of 'em...\" but I was really aiming at the left one, cuz it was closest. The wind was a little out of the left, so if the bullet drifted, I figured I might get the one on the right - but really expected to miss on the first shot... Because of the distance, I held and inch or two high and started taking up that long trigger pull of the Marlin Mauser action, expecting it to catch a little right before discharge, so I might take another breath to hold BANG! It didn't catch and away went the shot! I saw something flop on the mound and tried desperately to reacquire - - From behind me I hear, \"You got to be kidding! Let's step that off!\" Trying to be casual, I didn't say anything, just put the rifle on safe, slung it and started walking (We always carried our rifles for snakes, and the off chance of having belligerent folk show up) - - Well, we got out to the mound, and there was both dogs, minus their heads! I couldn't believe it! The bullet had flopped them both in opposite directions, but distance wise, they were also about 5 feet apart - - \"We'd better step that back,\" he said and we did, him taking big strides. It was 426 of his big steps, about 435 of mine. He still beat me on totals that day, but I never saw him make a longer shot, and he was the best shot I ever knew personally. My chest stuck out a little as we had hamburgers for lunch, but didn't dare brag about it. Dad was the best shot Dad knew, too; and he hated to be out done with a gun! Figuring that a prairie dog isn't much bigger than your hand when lying out flat - yup...one..or two in a million! Wandering and Wondering",

He said that there was no way I could get his rifle sown that quick so he stepped off about a hundred feet and put a nickel in the fork of a tree about 5 feet off the ground.

The wind started blowing hard out of a canyon and all the greens were on a 45 degree angle and fast as crap - CRAP!! He was a pretty good golfer, so he wasn't doing to bad, but I was quadrople doople boogying everything - terrible. We reach the 9th tee and my score is about 130 so I've about had enough anyway, but when we step out on this tee, I see it is elevated about 50-75 feet above this par-4 460 yard fairway, and we got about a 30 knot wind behind us, so I say, \"Darrel, I'm just gona see how far I can hit this thing.\" Now, I'm left handed and have hit many a homerun, but my golf swing absolutely sux, and I usually hit a terrible slice that may head left 100 yards some times, but I just didn't care. We kind survey the place and all the sane players have already left, because of some drizzle, and the only people in sight are just finishing up on the far green, so I tee up, pull out the ole driver, and let her rip with every muscle I had developed with years of powerlifting!! Usually that results in a shank, or a topper, or a snake killer - or a miss - - but this time there was such a solid CRACK it sounded like a pistol shot! And that thing took off at a 45 degree angle and vanished!! Well, we kept watching for it to bounce, but saw nothing, so I figured it went into the orchard on the right... Suddenly, one of the guys on the green jumped and began looking around all over the place, until his eyes finally raised to us 460+ yards away! Then he started waving his fist at us and his partner was kind of restraining him. So I kinda raised my hands up to the clouds and shrugged my shoulders in a visual apology... They then finished out, the guy shook his fist again, then - thank goodness - they left... \"Musta rolled up on the green while he was getting ready to putt,\" Darrel said as he teed up and hit a nice long drive about 200 yards with the wind... Well, we walked kind slow to his ball, to see if the other guys would come back, but they got in their car and left. He hit an iron onto the green, but I couldn't see my ball anywhere. I figured, because they were angry, they may have took it or kicked it into the water, but I didn't care - then we walked up onto the green and there was Darrel's ball alright, but nothing else in sight anywhere, but what was really weird was there where two holes on the green about 3 feet apart - one with a flag and one without - - \"What the hell....!\" Darrel said and he walked over to look. \"Hey, sport, here's yer ball...\" I walked over there, and in a funnel-shaped hole about six inches deep, with bits of green and sand splatter around it - approximately in a place that would have put it right between the two guys that had been playing ahead of us - was a Titlist ball just like the one I'd smacked off the tee way back there!!! \"Geeeeze, that coulda killed one of 'em!\" I said. \"Better fix this hole!\" \"Screw that!\" said Darrel. \"Let's get outta here before they come back with friends or a gun or something!!\" Yup - that's as close as I ever come to making a hole in one - !!

But I'll throw in one more - - I took my boys rabbit hunting maybe 10 years ago, and we were all packing shotguns and walking in snow about 4 inches deep through endless sagebrush flats with occasion long open areas that are perfect for pushing Jackrabbits towards for some real fun. My youngest, now a 25 year old policeman, was walking along closed to me when a bunch of rabbits jumped and headed out like low flying jets. He began banging away and so did I, getting a couple and emptying both our guns. About then one of the other boys jumped a few and fired some shots causing one to come on the full motor right down the center of this opening so that he would pass right across in front of us at about 30-40 yards. My boy was trying frantically to get shells out of his pocket, but I knew it was futile, so I said, \"Watch this....\" I non-chalantly reached for my left hip and pulled up my .357 Colt Trooper loaded with hollowpoints, thumbed back the hammer, put the front blade on the bunny and swung with him one-haned until the blade came even with his chest and touched 'er off. The rabbit evaporated right before his eyes!! Leaving the hammer on the expended cartridge, I re-holstered the cannon and said, \"That's how its done...\" The kid was stunned. Frankly so was I, but he didn't need to know it. After all Dad was dead, and I had some legendary shoes to fill By the way, I ain't got the strength to even pick that pistol up any more - so I gave it to the kid - At 6'4\" 220, he hefts it just fine!!

        "reply": "That's great!! I was hoping more would post, but maybe I scared 'em off, as usual . . . But I'll throw in one more - - I took my boys rabbit hunting maybe 10 years ago, and we were all packing shotguns and walking in snow about 4 inches deep through endless sagebrush flats with occasion long open areas that are perfect for pushing Jackrabbits towards for some real fun. My youngest, now a 25 year old policeman, was walking along closed to me when a bunch of rabbits jumped and headed out like low flying jets. He began banging away and so did I, getting a couple and emptying both our guns. About then one of the other boys jumped a few and fired some shots causing one to come on the full motor right down the center of this opening so that he would pass right across in front of us at about 30-40 yards. My boy was trying frantically to get shells out of his pocket, but I knew it was futile, so I said, \"Watch this....\" I non-chalantly reached for my left hip and pulled up my .357 Colt Trooper loaded with hollowpoints, thumbed back the hammer, put the front blade on the bunny and swung with him one-haned until the blade came even with his chest and touched 'er off. The rabbit evaporated right before his eyes!! Leaving the hammer on the expended cartridge, I re-holstered the cannon and said, \"That's how its done...\" The kid was stunned. Frankly so was I, but he didn't need to know it. After all Dad was dead, and I had some legendary shoes to fill By the way, I ain't got the strength to even pick that pistol up any more - so I gave it to the kid - At 6'4\" 220, he hefts it just fine!! This is my gang, and the youngest is the one in the middle - - Wandering and Wondering",

As several here know I spent over thiry years working in the mountains.. one summer afternoon I was sitting on a log making notes on my map and noticed two squirrels, just over there about 10 feet away chasing each other.. Up the tree, down the tree, around and around the tree they went.. It was great fun to watch AND THEN it happened... It appears one of them squirrels was a girl and the other was a boy and the dude caught her at the base of the tree... well that boy squirrel began doing what boys do in that situation... he was just knocking himself out so-to-speak. Now, I was a gum chewer at that time so I took out my gum, rolled it into a ball and let fly. There was no aiming, I just let-r-rip.. and I pegged that dude right in the back of his little head... he made what looked like one huge startled thrust and I am sure the gal's eyes got as big as \"buckwheats\" on Little Rascals... they parted, he going his way and she going hers.

        "content": "You asked for it - I have several over half a century, but one really stuck with me. There was a five acre apple orchard near where I live. Dad eventually bought it, because I was in all the time playing, eating apples, etc. He didn't realize stolen apples taste much better than ones you have to work for, but anyway, when I was about 8, I got one of those store-bought slingshots which was basically a piece of stout wire made into a \"Y\" shape with some elastic bands and a piece of leather to complete the thing. Not much to it. So, I headed down towards the orchard for some target practice, picking up a pocket full of pea-gravel from the road-side on the way... Once I got down there, I started \"thwacking\" just about everything (leaves, knot-holes on limbs, apples) with pretty good success....then I see this robin!! The stalk was on!! But the bird was no dummy. He kept flying off down the row two or three trees every time I would start getting in position to try a shot. Finally he landed in the crotch of a large apple tree two trees down from me, and was in a great place for an open shot. The only problem was, the tree between us was so big and so dense, there was no weeds under it to hide my approach. He would see any attempt I made to get closer, and maybe fly clear out of the orchard all together, because we were almost to the end of the row. So I decided if I could lob a rock up and over the tree in between, it might bounce down through the leaves and branches with just enough noise to get the robin to move up in the tree a little, but not frighten it enough to make it fly away. Now, these were very old apple trees, maybe 30 feet high, umbrellaing an area 20-30 feet across. So I put a little piece of pea-gravel in the leather cup, drew the elastics back, and aimed up in the air so the rock would clear the top of the tree and com down in the next, hoping not to shoot too far or too short... I lined up the shot as best I could to were the robin was and let fly - and the little piece of gravel went out of sight... Then I watched and listened for it to come down through the leaves, but nothing... About then, the robin hopped down on the ground into the grass, probably looking for a worm, I thought. So I had my opportunity to sneak closer anyway. Putting the trunk of the interceding tree between me and my prey, I crept forwards in my best \"Tonto\" stalk, then peered around the trunk carefully. Sure enough, I could see the robin on the ground, its wing twitching a little, but it didn't seem like it was chasing worms. In fact the other wign was out flat on the grass!?!?! I thought of taking a shot, but then its head came up, beak open, shuddered a little and flopped over towards the shuddering wing - and I could see the red of blood!! I jumped up and ran over there to the next tree. The robin was dead, and the piece of pea-gravel was sticking out of its eye! WOW! Of course, it was 100% dumb luck. At best, I had only hoped to startle the bird a little and get it to move. It had to have either looked up in the sky or down at the ground with one eye, the way they do - twisting their heads side to side, in order to have an eye skyward when the rock came down.... I just couldn't believe it - like shooting over a house to hit a BB! But from that point on, whether it be BB guns or Tank guns - I had a thirst to shoot straight and true . . . As for the robin, I set him up in the fork of a limb - like and Indian burial . . . As for the story - never told it 'til now. Who in the hell would believe it?? Wandering and Wondering",

The road was about 3 miles long and houses were all along the road. Anyhoo, in the back yard there was a sour apple tree. The apples would fall on the ground and really weren't good for anything except feedin them to the hogs. Now, if you stood in our back yard and looked down the hollar, you would see the roof of our neighbors house about 100 or so yards down. He had a work shed out behind his house and the door kinda faced up the hollar, towards out back yard. Well, we got the big idea one day to go up in the woods and find a real slender, strong stick and whittle the end to a real sharp point. We then found some apples that had probably just fallen on the ground (nice and hard). We jammed that apple on the end of that stick, rared back and flung the schidt out of it! First we did one apple, then we did a couple together, all were bouncing of out neighbors roof! We were laughin our arse of! Little did we know that our neighbor was in his shed! Bought that time my sis slung another green apple as hard as she could and the guy stepped into the doorway of the shed and he got nailed right in the forehead! I laughed until I puked! Needless to say, Sis and I were called a few colorful names, and the neighbor guy walked around with a third eye for about a month. That's my story and I'm stickin to it",

Well, we got the big idea one day to go up in the woods and find a real slender, strong stick and whittle the end to a real sharp point. We then found some apples that had probably just fallen on the ground (nice and hard). We jammed that apple on the end of that stick, rared back and flung the schidt out of it! First we did one apple, then we did a couple together, all were bouncing of out neighbors roof! We were laughin our arse of! Little did we know that our neighbor was in his shed! Bought that time my sis slung another green apple as hard as she could and the guy stepped into the doorway of the shed and he got nailed right in the forehead! I laughed until I puked! Needless to say, Sis and I were called a few colorful names, and the neighbor guy walked around with a third eye for about a month. That's my story and I'm stickin to it",

Ranchers and farmers would almost buy yer bullets for ya and point ya to the right place, they hated prairie dogs so bad. The critters could clear off new wheat or alfalfa faster than it could poke up - - Anyway, we're out there going for accuracy, and distance. No shots under 100 yards unless it's a called headshot. Ya get two shots for a hit, then it's the other guy's turn. Ya count both shots and hits. Ya step off all long shots. The guy with the most hits in fewest shots wins over all...but the longest shot is definitely bragging rights too. Typical scores after a morning would be 76/94 vs 81/100 Dad usually won. He used a .22-250 with a filed trigger sear. I used a .243 with such a long trigger pull it seemed two-staged, but I was used to it. Both had Leopold 3 x 9 variable scopes and we shot dead rest over the hood of a pickup on a small sand bag.. . But one time we're glassing the distant mounds and I see a dog so far out the heat waves are really distorting it, so I call it. Dad sees it and suggests we move to where we might see more closer, but I want to try it. So he gives the go-ahead. As I dig my feet into the sand and settle in, another one comes up on the mound and flops down - so when I put the crosshairs down, I see them both lying flat sunning like one long one - - Dad says, \"Right or Left?\" as he watches through his binoculars Being a smart azz, I said, \"Both of 'em...\" but I was really aiming at the left one, cuz it was closest. The wind was a little out of the left, so if the bullet drifted, I figured I might get the one on the right - but really expected to miss on the first shot... Because of the distance, I held and inch or two high and started taking up that long trigger pull of the Marlin Mauser action, expecting it to catch a little right before discharge, so I might take another breath to hold BANG! It didn't catch and away went the shot! I saw something flop on the mound and tried desperately to reacquire - - From behind me I hear, \"You got to be kidding! Let's step that off!\" Trying to be casual, I didn't say anything, just put the rifle on safe, slung it and started walking (We always carried our rifles for snakes, and the off chance of having belligerent folk show up) - - Well, we got out to the mound, and there was both dogs, minus their heads! I couldn't believe it! The bullet had flopped them both in opposite directions, but distance wise, they were also about 5 feet apart - - \"We'd better step that back,\" he said and we did, him taking big strides. It was 426 of his big steps, about 435 of mine. He still beat me on totals that day, but I never saw him make a longer shot, and he was the best shot I ever knew personally. My chest stuck out a little as we had hamburgers for lunch, but didn't dare brag about it. Dad was the best shot Dad knew, too; and he hated to be out done with a gun! Figuring that a prairie dog isn't much bigger than your hand when lying out flat - yup...one..or two in a million! Wandering and Wondering",

He said that there was no way I could get his rifle sown that quick so he stepped off about a hundred feet and put a nickel in the fork of a tree about 5 feet off the ground. He poured the powder, rammed home the ball and wadding, and put a cap in place. He said try that.

The wind started blowing hard out of a canyon and all the greens were on a 45 degree angle and fast as crap - CRAP!! He was a pretty good golfer, so he wasn't doing to bad, but I was quadrople doople boogying everything - terrible. We reach the 9th tee and my score is about 130 so I've about had enough anyway, but when we step out on this tee, I see it is elevated about 50-75 feet above this par-4 460 yard fairway, and we got about a 30 knot wind behind us, so I say, \"Darrel, I'm just gona see how far I can hit this thing.\" Now, I'm left handed and have hit many a homerun, but my golf swing absolutely sux, and I usually hit a terrible slice that may head left 100 yards some times, but I just didn't care. We kind survey the place and all the sane players have already left, because of some drizzle, and the only people in sight are just finishing up on the far green, so I tee up, pull out the ole driver, and let her rip with every muscle I had developed with years of powerlifting!! Usually that results in a shank, or a topper, or a snake killer - or a miss - - but this time there was such a solid CRACK it sounded like a pistol shot! And that thing took off at a 45 degree angle and vanished!! Well, we kept watching for it to bounce, but saw nothing, so I figured it went into the orchard on the right... Suddenly, one of the guys on the green jumped and began looking around all over the place, until his eyes finally raised to us 460+ yards away! Then he started waving his fist at us and his partner was kind of restraining him. So I kinda raised my hands up to the clouds and shrugged my shoulders in a visual apology... They then finished out, the guy shook his fist again, then - thank goodness - they left... \"Musta rolled up on the green while he was getting ready to putt,\" Darrel said as he teed up and hit a nice long drive about 200 yards with the wind... Well, we walked kind slow to his ball, to see if the other guys would come back, but they got in their car and left. He hit an iron onto the green, but I couldn't see my ball anywhere. I figured, because they were angry, they may have took it or kicked it into the water, but I didn't care - then we walked up onto the green and there was Darrel's ball alright, but nothing else in sight anywhere, but what was really weird was there where two holes on the green about 3 feet apart - one with a flag and one without - - \"What the hell....!\" Darrel said and he walked over to look. \"Hey, sport, here's yer ball...\" I walked over there, and in a funnel-shaped hole about six inches deep, with bits of green and sand splatter around it - approximately in a place that would have put it right between the two guys that had been playing ahead of us - was a Titlist ball just like the one I'd smacked off the tee way back there!!! \"Geeeeze, that coulda killed one of 'em!\" I said. \"Better fix this hole!\" \"Screw that!\" said Darrel. \"Let's get outta here before they come back with friends or a gun or something!!\" Yup - that's as close as I ever come to making a hole in one - !!

My youngest, now a 25 year old policeman, was walking along closed to me when a bunch of rabbits jumped and headed out like low flying jets.

        "content": "You asked for it - I have several over half a century, but one really stuck with me. There was a five acre apple orchard near where I live. Dad eventually bought it, because I was in all the time playing, eating apples, etc. He didn't realize stolen apples taste much better than ones you have to work for, but anyway, when I was about 8, I got one of those store-bought slingshots which was basically a piece of stout wire made into a \"Y\" shape with some elastic bands and a piece of leather to complete the thing. Not much to it. So, I headed down towards the orchard for some target practice, picking up a pocket full of pea-gravel from the road-side on the way... Once I got down there, I started \"thwacking\" just about everything (leaves, knot-holes on limbs, apples) with pretty good success....then I see this robin!! The stalk was on!! But the bird was no dummy. He kept flying off down the row two or three trees every time I would start getting in position to try a shot. Finally he landed in the crotch of a large apple tree two trees down from me, and was in a great place for an open shot. The only problem was, the tree between us was so big and so dense, there was no weeds under it to hide my approach. He would see any attempt I made to get closer, and maybe fly clear out of the orchard all together, because we were almost to the end of the row. So I decided if I could lob a rock up and over the tree in between, it might bounce down through the leaves and branches with just enough noise to get the robin to move up in the tree a little, but not frighten it enough to make it fly away. Now, these were very old apple trees, maybe 30 feet high, umbrellaing an area 20-30 feet across. So I put a little piece of pea-gravel in the leather cup, drew the elastics back, and aimed up in the air so the rock would clear the top of the tree and com down in the next, hoping not to shoot too far or too short... I lined up the shot as best I could to were the robin was and let fly - and the little piece of gravel went out of sight... Then I watched and listened for it to come down through the leaves, but nothing... About then, the robin hopped down on the ground into the grass, probably looking for a worm, I thought. So I had my opportunity to sneak closer anyway. Putting the trunk of the interceding tree between me and my prey, I crept forwards in my best \"Tonto\" stalk, then peered around the trunk carefully. Sure enough, I could see the robin on the ground, its wing twitching a little, but it didn't seem like it was chasing worms. In fact the other wign was out flat on the grass!?!?! I thought of taking a shot, but then its head came up, beak open, shuddered a little and flopped over towards the shuddering wing - and I could see the red of blood!! I jumped up and ran over there to the next tree. The robin was dead, and the piece of pea-gravel was sticking out of its eye! WOW! Of course, it was 100% dumb luck. At best, I had only hoped to startle the bird a little and get it to move. It had to have either looked up in the sky or down at the ground with one eye, the way they do - twisting their heads side to side, in order to have an eye skyward when the rock came down.... I just couldn't believe it - like shooting over a house to hit a BB! But from that point on, whether it be BB guns or Tank guns - I had a thirst to shoot straight and true . . . As for the robin, I set him up in the fork of a limb - like and Indian burial . . . As for the story - never told it 'til now. Who in the hell would believe it?? Wandering and Wondering",

Me and Sis (Jonsey) grew up in a small town in the appalachain mountains. We were outside most of the time playin. Our home was in a hollar with a dead end road. The road was about 3 miles long and houses were all along the road. Anyhoo, in the back yard there was a sour apple tree. The apples would fall on the ground and really weren't good for anything except feedin them to the hogs. Now, if you stood in our back yard and looked down the hollar, you would see the roof of our neighbors house about 100 or so yards down. He had a work shed out behind his house and the door kinda faced up the hollar, towards out back yard. Well, we got the big idea one day to go up in the woods and find a real slender, strong stick and whittle the end to a real sharp point. We then found some apples that had probably just fallen on the ground (nice and hard). We jammed that apple on the end of that stick, rared back and flung the schidt out of it! First we did one apple, then we did a couple together, all were bouncing of out neighbors roof! We were laughin our arse of! Little did we know that our neighbor was in his shed! Bought that time my sis slung another green apple as hard as she could and the guy stepped into the doorway of the shed and he got nailed right in the forehead! I laughed until I puked! Needless to say, Sis and I were called a few colorful names, and the neighbor guy walked around with a third eye for about a month. That's my story and I'm stickin to it",

Ranchers and farmers would almost buy yer bullets for ya and point ya to the right place, they hated prairie dogs so bad. The critters could clear off new wheat or alfalfa faster than it could poke up - - Anyway, we're out there going for accuracy, and distance. No shots under 100 yards unless it's a called headshot. Ya get two shots for a hit, then it's the other guy's turn. Ya count both shots and hits. Ya step off all long shots. The guy with the most hits in fewest shots wins over all...but the longest shot is definitely bragging rights too. Typical scores after a morning would be 76/94 vs 81/100 Dad usually won. He used a .22-250 with a filed trigger sear. I used a .243 with such a long trigger pull it seemed two-staged, but I was used to it. Both had Leopold 3 x 9 variable scopes and we shot dead rest over the hood of a pickup on a small sand bag.. . But one time we're glassing the distant mounds and I see a dog so far out the heat waves are really distorting it, so I call it. Dad sees it and suggests we move to where we might see more closer, but I want to try it. So he gives the go-ahead. As I dig my feet into the sand and settle in, another one comes up on the mound and flops down - so when I put the crosshairs down, I see them both lying flat sunning like one long one - - Dad says, \"Right or Left?\" as he watches through his binoculars Being a smart azz, I said, \"Both of 'em...\" but I was really aiming at the left one, cuz it was closest. The wind was a little out of the left, so if the bullet drifted, I figured I might get the one on the right - but really expected to miss on the first shot... Because of the distance, I held and inch or two high and started taking up that long trigger pull of the Marlin Mauser action, expecting it to catch a little right before discharge, so I might take another breath to hold BANG! It didn't catch and away went the shot! I saw something flop on the mound and tried desperately to reacquire - - From behind me I hear, \"You got to be kidding! Let's step that off!\" Trying to be casual, I didn't say anything, just put the rifle on safe, slung it and started walking (We always carried our rifles for snakes, and the off chance of having belligerent folk show up) - - Well, we got out to the mound, and there was both dogs, minus their heads! I couldn't believe it! The bullet had flopped them both in opposite directions, but distance wise, they were also about 5 feet apart - - \"We'd better step that back,\" he said and we did, him taking big strides. It was 426 of his big steps, about 435 of mine. He still beat me on totals that day, but I never saw him make a longer shot, and he was the best shot I ever knew personally. My chest stuck out a little as we had hamburgers for lunch, but didn't dare brag about it. Dad was the best shot Dad knew, too; and he hated to be out done with a gun! Figuring that a prairie dog isn't much bigger than your hand when lying out flat - yup...one..or two in a million! Wandering and Wondering",

One guy had a black powder rifle and it was absolutely cool as heck. I asked him to let me try and after a shot or two I had the feel down for it. He said that there was no way I could get his rifle sown that quick so he stepped off about a hundred feet and put a nickel in the fork of a tree about 5 feet off the ground. He poured the powder, rammed home the ball and wadding, and put a cap in place. He said try that. I took one look at him, the next at the nickel, raised the weapon, and slowly squeezed the trigger, remembering to hold the rifle steady after the initial firing. That nickel disappeared quicker than schidt through a goose. Little did he know that my brothers and I used to practice rifle shots with a .22 at 100 feet by hitting match sticks.

Here's one for the golfers. Me and a little wrestling coach buddy decided to do dome golfing at one of those gawd-awful courses built up and down the side of a mountain. The wind started blowing hard out of a canyon and all the greens were on a 45 degree angle and fast as crap - CRAP!! He was a pretty good golfer, so he wasn't doing to bad, but I was quadrople doople boogying everything - terrible. We reach the 9th tee and my score is about 130 so I've about had enough anyway, but when we step out on this tee, I see it is elevated about 50-75 feet above this par-4 460 yard fairway, and we got about a 30 knot wind behind us, so I say, \"Darrel, I'm just gona see how far I can hit this thing.\" Now, I'm left handed and have hit many a homerun, but my golf swing absolutely sux, and I usually hit a terrible slice that may head left 100 yards some times, but I just didn't care. We kind survey the place and all the sane players have already left, because of some drizzle, and the only people in sight are just finishing up on the far green, so I tee up, pull out the ole driver, and let her rip with every muscle I had developed with years of powerlifting!! Usually that results in a shank, or a topper, or a snake killer - or a miss - - but this time there was such a solid CRACK it sounded like a pistol shot! And that thing took off at a 45 degree angle and vanished!! Well, we kept watching for it to bounce, but saw nothing, so I figured it went into the orchard on the right... Suddenly, one of the guys on the green jumped and began looking around all over the place, until his eyes finally raised to us 460+ yards away! Then he started waving his fist at us and his partner was kind of restraining him. So I kinda raised my hands up to the clouds and shrugged my shoulders in a visual apology... They then finished out, the guy shook his fist again, then - thank goodness - they left... \"Musta rolled up on the green while he was getting ready to putt,\" Darrel said as he teed up and hit a nice long drive about 200 yards with the wind... Well, we walked kind slow to his ball, to see if the other guys would come back, but they got in their car and left. He hit an iron onto the green, but I couldn't see my ball anywhere. I figured, because they were angry, they may have took it or kicked it into the water, but I didn't care - then we walked up onto the green and there was Darrel's ball alright, but nothing else in sight anywhere, but what was really weird was there where two holes on the green about 3 feet apart - one with a flag and one without - - \"What the hell....!\" Darrel said and he walked over to look. \"Hey, sport, here's yer ball...\" I walked over there, and in a funnel-shaped hole about six inches deep, with bits of green and sand splatter around it - approximately in a place that would have put it right between the two guys that had been playing ahead of us - was a Titlist ball just like the one I'd smacked off the tee way back there!!! \"Geeeeze, that coulda killed one of 'em!\" I said. \"Better fix this hole!\" \"Screw that!\" said Darrel. \"Let's get outta here before they come back with friends or a gun or something!!\" Yup - that's as close as I ever come to making a hole in one - !!

Suddenly, one of the guys on the green jumped and began looking around all over the place, until his eyes finally raised to us 460+ yards away! Then he started waving his fist at us and his partner was kind of restraining him. So I kinda raised my hands up to the clouds and shrugged my shoulders in a visual apology... They then finished out, the guy shook his fist again, then - thank goodness - they left... \"Musta rolled up on the green while he was getting ready to putt,\" Darrel said as he teed up and hit a nice long drive about 200 yards with the wind... Well, we walked kind slow to his ball, to see if the other guys would come back, but they got in their car and left. He hit an iron onto the green, but I couldn't see my ball anywhere. I figured, because they were angry, they may have took it or kicked it into the water, but I didn't care - then we walked up onto the green and there was Darrel's ball alright, but nothing else in sight anywhere, but what was really weird was there where two holes on the green about 3 feet apart - one with a flag and one without - - \"What the hell....!\" Darrel said and he walked over to look. \"Hey, sport, here's yer ball...\" I walked over there, and in a funnel-shaped hole about six inches deep, with bits of green and sand splatter around it - approximately in a place that would have put it right between the two guys that had been playing ahead of us - was a Titlist ball just like the one I'd smacked off the tee way back there!!! \"Geeeeze, that coulda killed one of 'em!\" I said. \"Better fix this hole!\" \"Screw that!\" said Darrel. \"Let's get outta here before they come back with friends or a gun or something!!\" Yup - that's as close as I ever come to making a hole in one - !!

But I'll throw in one more - - I took my boys rabbit hunting maybe 10 years ago, and we were all packing shotguns and walking in snow about 4 inches deep through endless sagebrush flats with occasion long open areas that are perfect for pushing Jackrabbits towards for some real fun. My youngest, now a 25 year old policeman, was walking along closed to me when a bunch of rabbits jumped and headed out like low flying jets. He began banging away and so did I, getting a couple and emptying both our guns. About then one of the other boys jumped a few and fired some shots causing one to come on the full motor right down the center of this opening so that he would pass right across in front of us at about 30-40 yards. My boy was trying frantically to get shells out of his pocket, but I knew it was futile, so I said, \"Watch this....\" I non-chalantly reached for my left hip and pulled up my .357 Colt Trooper loaded with hollowpoints, thumbed back the hammer, put the front blade on the bunny and swung with him one-haned until the blade came even with his chest and touched 'er off. The rabbit evaporated right before his eyes!! Leaving the hammer on the expended cartridge, I re-holstered the cannon and said, \"That's how its done...\" The kid was stunned. Frankly so was I, but he didn't need to know it. After all Dad was dead, and I had some legendary shoes to fill By the way, I ain't got the strength to even pick that pistol up any more - so I gave it to the kid - At 6'4\" 220, he hefts it just fine!! This is my gang, and the youngest is the one in the middle - - Wandering and Wondering",

Even though I'd put on my blinker to indicate I needed to get over a lane, he just sat there, smiling. At that moment, I happened to have been chewing about 4 sticks of gum and decided I'd just plaster that on his windshield to get his attention and make a statement, so I rared back and tossed it out the window.
