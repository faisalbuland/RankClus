Now, diving it all 30 sec of thought, assuming I'd been the fool who gave PM Brown the non-functional DVD's what would I do to make it better, that was uniquely American AND put A few bucks in a Democrat's pocket? A piece of Ben Nighthorse Campbell's jewelry, of course! Ben's a \"Native American\" , a world class nativist jewelry designer/maker, and former Democrat Senator! PERFECT! See his things here: \"\"http://www.canyonart.com/jewelpre.htm Now, as much as I dislike the ideas that Mr. Obama seems to hold dear, I really don't think that he should be traveling around the globe demonstrating that Americans are really classless , thoughtless, rude, insulting ugly Americans. Somebody please drop by Ben's and commission a couple hundred items, add an official gift giver to travel with him and distribute a unique piece to each head of state he meets. For our nation's sake if nothing else.",
