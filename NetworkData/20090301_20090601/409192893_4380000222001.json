        "content": "Think they will get a clue before it is too late? The GOP: divorced from reality The Republican base is behaving like a guy who just got dumped by his wife. By Bill Maher April 24, 2009 If conservatives don't want to be seen as bitter people who cling to their guns and religion and anti-immigrant sentiments, they should stop being bitter and clinging to their guns, religion and anti-immigrant sentiments. It's been a week now, and I still don't know what those \"tea bag\" protests were about. I saw signs protesting abortion, illegal immigrants, the bank bailout and that gay guy who's going to win \"American Idol.\" But it wasn't tax day that made them crazy; it was election day. Because that's when Republicans became what they fear most: a minority. The conservative base is absolutely apoplectic because, because ... well, nobody knows. They're mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore. Even though they're not quite sure what \"it\" is. But they know they're fed up with \"it,\" and that \"it\" has got to stop. Here are the big issues for normal people: the war, the economy, the environment, mending fences with our enemies and allies, and the rule of law. And here's the list of Republican obsessions since President Obama took office: that his birth certificate is supposedly fake, he uses a teleprompter too much, he bowed to a Saudi guy, Europeans like him, he gives inappropriate gifts, his wife shamelessly flaunts her upper arms, and he shook hands with Hugo Chavez and slipped him the nuclear launch codes. Do these sound like the concerns of a healthy, vibrant political party? It's sad what's happened to the Republicans. They used to be the party of the big tent; now they're the party of the sideshow attraction, a socially awkward group of mostly white people who speak a language only they understand. Like Trekkies, but paranoid. The GOP base is convinced that Obama is going to raise their taxes, which he just lowered. But, you say, \"Bill, that's just the fringe of the Republican Party.\" No, it's not. The governor of Texas, Rick Perry, is not afraid to say publicly that thinking out loud about Texas seceding from the Union is appropriate considering that ... Obama wants to raise taxes 3% on 5% of the people? I'm not sure exactly what Perry's independent nation would look like, but I'm pretty sure it would be free of taxes and Planned Parenthood. And I would have to totally rethink my position on a border fence. I know. It's not about what Obama's done. It's what he's planning. But you can't be sick and tired of something someone might do. Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota recently said she fears that Obama will build \"reeducation\" camps to indoctrinate young people. But Obama hasn't made any moves toward taking anyone's guns, and with money as tight as it is, the last thing the president wants to do is run a camp where he has to shelter and feed a bunch of fat, angry white people. Look, I get it, \"real America.\" After an eight-year run of controlling the White House, Congress and the Supreme Court, this latest election has you feeling like a rejected husband. You've come home to find your things out on the front lawn -- or at least more things than you usually keep out on the front lawn. You're not ready to let go, but the country you love is moving on. And now you want to call it a ***** and key its car. That's what you are, the bitter divorced guy whose country has left him -- obsessing over it, haranguing it, blubbering one minute about how much you love it and vowing the next that if you cannot have it, nobody will. But it's been almost 100 days, and your country is not coming back to you. She's found somebody new. And it's a black guy.

Each of the parties has been where the GOP is now. Each has recovered. It wasn't too long ago the Dems had big majorities in Congress and the White House. 2 years later the dems got booted out when the rest of America realized that moderates weren't in control of the Domocratic party after all. Same thing just happened to the GOP. And, as long as we have a two-party system, it will stay that way. Last time the Dems were sucking hind tit, GOP talking heads were saying they should give up gay rights, gun control, socialized healthcare, etc. The party core held on, and that \"middle third\" of Americans swung back their way eventually. The GOP isn't going to abandon the 2nd Amendment, immigration reform or religeous freedom, and that \"middle third\" will swing back their way.

It wasn't too long ago the Dems had big majorities in Congress and the White House. 2 years later the dems got booted out when the rest of America realized that moderates weren't in control of the Domocratic party after all. Same thing just happened to the GOP. And, as long as we have a two-party system, it will stay that way. Last time the Dems were sucking hind tit, GOP talking heads were saying they should give up gay rights, gun control, socialized healthcare, etc. The party core held on, and that \"middle third\" of Americans swung back their way eventually. The GOP isn't going to abandon the 2nd Amendment, immigration reform or religeous freedom, and that \"middle third\" will swing back their way.

And it wouldn't matter whether or not Bill Maher wrote that piece. However, Bill does have his own unique way of putting politics in proper perpective. As long as the GOP plays the hate and bitterness game, ie, \"my way or the highway or get lost forever,\" they are only doing a big time disservice to the overall welfare of their own party. It seems like the \"moderate wing\" of the GOP is just flat out gone! But that's not the moderates problem they ended up that way. The 'hawks' have taken over that party, and have pushed the mods out. One doesn't have to be an expert on politics to figure out that if the extreme right keeps going in their 'one way' direction, they themselves will be the undoing of the GOP.

        "quote": "Originally posted by SeaWitch1220: Think they will get a clue before it is too late? The GOP: divorced from reality The Republican base is behaving like a guy who just got dumped by his wife. By Bill Maher April 24, 2009 If conservatives don't want to be seen as bitter people who cling to their guns and religion and anti-immigrant sentiments, they should stop being bitter and clinging to their guns, religion and anti-immigrant sentiments. It's been a week now, and I still don't know what those \"tea bag\" protests were about. I saw signs protesting abortion, illegal immigrants, the bank bailout and that gay guy who's going to win \"American Idol.\" But it wasn't tax day that made them crazy; it was election day. Because that's when Republicans became what they fear most: a minority. The conservative base is absolutely apoplectic because, because ... well, nobody knows. They're mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore. Even though they're not quite sure what \"it\" is. But they know they're fed up with \"it,\" and that \"it\" has got to stop. Here are the big issues for normal people: the war, the economy, the environment, mending fences with our enemies and allies, and the rule of law. And here's the list of Republican obsessions since President Obama took office: that his birth certificate is supposedly fake, he uses a teleprompter too much, he bowed to a Saudi guy, Europeans like him, he gives inappropriate gifts, his wife shamelessly flaunts her upper arms, and he shook hands with Hugo Chavez and slipped him the nuclear launch codes. Do these sound like the concerns of a healthy, vibrant political party? It's sad what's happened to the Republicans. They used to be the party of the big tent; now they're the party of the sideshow attraction, a socially awkward group of mostly white people who speak a language only they understand. Like Trekkies, but paranoid. The GOP base is convinced that Obama is going to raise their taxes, which he just lowered. But, you say, \"Bill, that's just the fringe of the Republican Party.\" No, it's not. The governor of Texas, Rick Perry, is not afraid to say publicly that thinking out loud about Texas seceding from the Union is appropriate considering that ... Obama wants to raise taxes 3% on 5% of the people? I'm not sure exactly what Perry's independent nation would look like, but I'm pretty sure it would be free of taxes and Planned Parenthood. And I would have to totally rethink my position on a border fence. I know. It's not about what Obama's done. It's what he's planning. But you can't be sick and tired of something someone might do. Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota recently said she fears that Obama will build \"reeducation\" camps to indoctrinate young people. But Obama hasn't made any moves toward taking anyone's guns, and with money as tight as it is, the last thing the president wants to do is run a camp where he has to shelter and feed a bunch of fat, angry white people. Look, I get it, \"real America.\" After an eight-year run of controlling the White House, Congress and the Supreme Court, this latest election has you feeling like a rejected husband. You've come home to find your things out on the front lawn -- or at least more things than you usually keep out on the front lawn. You're not ready to let go, but the country you love is moving on. And now you want to call it a ***** and key its car. That's what you are, the bitter divorced guy whose country has left him -- obsessing over it, haranguing it, blubbering one minute about how much you love it and vowing the next that if you cannot have it, nobody will. But it's been almost 100 days, and your country is not coming back to you. She's found somebody new. And it's a black guy.
