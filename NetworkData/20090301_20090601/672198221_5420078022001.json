Makes the whole article suspect. Having said that, there is little doubt in my mind that off-shore shelters cost the taxpayer substantially ... but ... you could just as well write titles that say \"What illegal aliens working off the books cost taxpayers\", \"What american citizens working off the books cost taxpayers\", \"What underreporting of tip income costs taxpayers\", etc. etc. etc. ... and the fun one, \"What underreporting of taxes by cabinet nominees costs taxpayers\".
