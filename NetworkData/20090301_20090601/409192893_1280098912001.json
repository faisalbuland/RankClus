Mr. Obama, please explain to us why you felt compelled on at least two different occasions to insult our cousins the British with cheap, thoughtless protocol and gifts, why you made us a laughing stock for the Russians and Iranians, yet felt compelled to show a submissive face to the king of Saudi Arabia. Americans, and that includes the President, do not bow to kings. We. Do. Not. Do. That. Ever. In case you forgot, Mr. Obama, the very chair you're sitting in was provided for you by the blood and lives of men who refused to bow before a foreign king. You govern now because a courageous band of men a few centuries ago decided to stand up to a tyrant, look him in the eye and say \"No more\". They took their lives into their own hands when they did that, and so too did the American soldiers and militiamen who faced what was then the most dangerous army in the world. They paid the price, Mr. Obama. They fought, bled, suffered, died and killed in places like Saratoga, Valley Forge and eventually Yorktown so that the President of our republic could look any crowned foreign potentate in the eye and not bow in submission to him. That's our tradition, Mr. Obama--that's our heritage and our birthright, given to us by far better men than you. You had no right to discard that with your shameful display of submission to an entity who may well be tomorrow's enemy. I can understand that, given your family history, you are not enamoured of the British. But we did not elect you to be the spokesperson at your next family reunion--that's up to the unfortunates associated with you by blood or marriage, and I do feel genuinely sorry for those folks. No, Sir--you were elected to represent the USA, and that means you, yes, YOU, are responsible for keeping up the traditions handed to you over the bodies of our fighting men. By bowing to a king you desecrated the sacrifices made by Americans living and dead to build and preserve the unique freedoms we have. And for what, Mr. Obama? Why did you feel the need to disgrace us in such a debased manner? You have much to explain, and over time you'll probably have much more to explain. You'll try to excuse yourself, of course--that's what children do when they're caught doing something forbidden. But for now will you please explain why you symbolically sold out every American soldier, from the die-hards who crossed the Delaware on Washington's last gamble to the fine young men facing our enemies in flyblown pestholes like Afghanistan, by BOWING to some tyrant....",

It's most likely that the President was just trying to be magnanimous, as I stated. However, personally speaking I wouldn't do something like that; I myself see it as subservience.

Americans, and that includes the President, do not bow to kings. We. Do. Not. Do. That. Ever.

Why did you feel the need to disgrace us in such a debased manner? You have much to explain, and over time you'll probably have much more to explain. You'll try to excuse yourself, of course--that's what children do when they're caught doing something forbidden.
