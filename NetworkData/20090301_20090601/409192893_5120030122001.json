The majority of taxes in government coffers were put there by the rich (the $250k+ wageearners) and corporations.

The lower class puts virtually nothing into the federal government and the middle class puts very little, yet they already reap the greatest rewards in terms of services they receive. The tax burden, apportioned by economic class, isn't as unfair as you think it is... In addition, true, 1 in 10 of the workers who made those corporations successful are now on unemployment.
