I did enjoy the day with my son however. He walked point and stumbled over every vine, root and stump in the woods. I would stop search the surrounding hedge row, the top of trees and the ground about 20 feet in front while listening for anything unusual although I really can\u2019t hear much anymore. I\u2019d then move up and do the same thing. I laughed at my son who\u2019s 33 and said you would have lasted maybe a day in VN because you would surely have walked into something. His retaliation was I should have been dead taking to long to go anywhere. My retaliation was when I walked point we always covered the ground for the day and no one got blown up because I missed a trip vine or wire. Strange how things stay with you after all these years. All you hunters out there we need you for wildlife management but as for myself I\u2019m more into people management, not that it does any good with all the bleeding hearts but that\u2019s a whole nother subject. I did read about the rednecks in NC. It sounds like home to me.",

Here's a little story about my first turkey hunt. First time I went turkey hunting, my freind set me up near the cabin as he & another guy went off elsewhere. I was doing some calling & got a gobbler answering. Sounded like it was coming straight in! I had a little two foot high camo net set up around with an old stone wall to my back. I was peeping over the wall looking into the woods, doing some light calling, had my shot gun leaning on the wall. I happen to turn around to see a gobbler in full strut, stomping into the field(opposite of where I was looking), my jaw dropped. He must have came in to a certain point, made a bit of a half circle to come into the field off to my left, nearly behind me. I had a jake decoy out. Guess he was pizzed to see a jake making a move on his would-be girlfreind! I had to do this slow motion move, reaching for the shotgun & turning around, while watching him to see when he was distracted to move. Thank goodness, for the jake decoy, he seemed ready to kick the jake's azz. Managed to get the gun up, take the shot & drop him(he was only about 20 yards way). About 15 minutes later, my buddies rolled up. I was sitting on the deck with the bird next to me. I said to them, \"is this how it's done?!?\" They had heard the shot & the one fellow, had said, \"Damn! That sounded like it came from the cabin\". They confessed, me being a rookie, they were afraid I might screw up their hunt. Since then(that was about 14yars ago), I've had some pretty good luck with spring turkey. If I was half as lucky with deer, I'd cll myself a hunter! Next month, we're off to Ohio, to do some spring turkeys over there. Any of guys out that way let me know! This message has been edited.
