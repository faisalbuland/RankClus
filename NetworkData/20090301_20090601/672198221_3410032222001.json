Souter didn't want to leave under the last Administration because he knew he would be replaced by a far-right applicant. He waited until a more liberal party was in the Whitehouse. This is nothing new. Why do you think the conservative justices retired during the last Administration? Nothing new. I'll bet Scalia tries to hang on for at least 8 years.",

My personal opinion is that Souter, who was appointed as a conservaitve, is more a liberatarian who truely believes in deciding based on precident and what is actually in the Constitution than implementing HIS own political beliefs (which is why the Repub conservatives disliked him).
