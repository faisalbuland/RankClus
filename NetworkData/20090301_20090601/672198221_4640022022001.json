An established defense for killing someone who's killed your dog is to claim temporary insanity. It's worked in a number of cases. And at least in my case it wouldn't even be a lie. A guy once kicked a dog I owned, and when I regained control of myself, the guy was a bloody pulp, and I really have no memory of doing this. If some freinds hadn't of come along and pulled me off of him, I have no idea what would have occured - But absolutely, I could have honestly claimed temporary insanity. Dave",
