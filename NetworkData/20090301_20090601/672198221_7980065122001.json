Instead of name calling, vituperation, stupid threats that he had no intention of carrying out, Obama is on the one hand, making serious offers of relaxing tension, while at the same time sticking to the bottom line of no nukes.

Dave Brilliant strategy....which doesn't do A DAMN THING to make sure Iran stops their nuclear weapons program As opposed to Mr. Bush's Strategy? He stopped them? He did a good job with North Korea as well, something like, \"Look a-hole, do your worst, we're onto you.\" Worked like a charm. For the first time in decades N. Korea actually got some support from other countries. As has been pointed out a number of times, it wasn't a Democrat who said, \"Talk softly but carry a big stick.\" As opposed to the previous administrations, \"Scream and curse and then back off.\" Now Obama is talking very softly while at the same time lining up meaningful sanctions - Sanctions that Mr. Bush was never able to impose because he had a BIG MOUTH.

Instead of name calling, vituperation, stupid threats that he had no intention of carrying out, Obama is on the one hand, making serious offers of relaxing tension, while at the same time sticking to the bottom line of no nukes.

Dave Brilliant strategy....which doesn't do A DAMN THING to make sure Iran stops their nuclear weapons program As opposed to Mr. Bush's Strategy? He stopped them? He did a good job with North Korea as well, something like, \"Look a-hole, do your worst, we're onto you.\" Worked like a charm. For the first time in decades N. Korea actually got some support from other countries. As has been pointed out a number of times, it wasn't a Democrat who said, \"Talk softly but carry a big stick.\" As opposed to the previous administrations, \"Scream and curse and then back off.\" Now Obama is talking very softly while at the same time lining up meaningful sanctions - Sanctions that Mr. Bush was never able to impose because he had a BIG MOUTH.
