Living with my mom, just the two of us, I climbed up the long ladder, slipped the flag into the holder screwed high up on the second deck of her house, and turned around to see that it was the only flag on the street. Later, the neighbor next door (retired Marine) put up his flag, and then another one went up (retired Navy). In all, only three flags were flying in honor of Memorial Day ... on a residential street of 25 houses. Today, here at work, I mentioned this to three of my active duty Navy colleagues, and we all agreed that flag sightings were indeed rare this weekend. Very disappointing. Is this a trend?? If so, why??",

I have to say, however, that I'd rather see one well-displayed flag than 20 poorly displayed flags. In my previous neighborhood, there was a guy who had this mid-sized flag stuck on a small pole in his front yard. It flew day and night without a light, and it was faded, torn, and tattered. He finally took it down, but it angered me every time I saw it. What's worse is that the guy probably got some false sense of patriotism out of abusing the flag like that. But as for this weekend, I wasn't home anyway. I was at an event at Crown Center in Kansas City. On Sunday night, everyone who was still left from the event watched the fireworks and listened to the orchestra together. It was brilliant, right over the big memorial on the hill. So, maybe I didn't fly a flag, but I didn't forget. Isn't that what memorial day is about?",

I have to say, however, that I'd rather see one well-displayed flag than 20 poorly displayed flags. In my previous neighborhood, there was a guy who had this mid-sized flag stuck on a small pole in his front yard. It flew day and night without a light, and it was faded, torn, and tattered. He finally took it down, but it angered me every time I saw it. What's worse is that the guy probably got some false sense of patriotism out of abusing the flag like that. But as for this weekend, I wasn't home anyway. I was at an event at Crown Center in Kansas City. On Sunday night, everyone who was still left from the event watched the fireworks and listened to the orchestra together. It was brilliant, right over the big memorial on the hill. So, maybe I didn't fly a flag, but I didn't forget. Isn't that what memorial day is about?",

In all, only three flags were flying in honor of Memorial Day ... on a residential street of 25 houses.

I have to say, however, that I'd rather see one well-displayed flag than 20 poorly displayed flags. In my previous neighborhood, there was a guy who had this mid-sized flag stuck on a small pole in his front yard. It flew day and night without a light, and it was faded, torn, and tattered. He finally took it down, but it angered me every time I saw it. What's worse is that the guy probably got some false sense of patriotism out of abusing the flag like that. But as for this weekend, I wasn't home anyway. I was at an event at Crown Center in Kansas City. On Sunday night, everyone who was still left from the event watched the fireworks and listened to the orchestra together. It was brilliant, right over the big memorial on the hill. So, maybe I didn't fly a flag, but I didn't forget. Isn't that what memorial day is about?",

Flags, cost varies with size and type, and is not that bad. American flag, 4 foot hoise, all weather poly. $20 Old navy jack, gift from my chief when I was discharged. Alabama state flag, $7 POW/MIA flag, $7 A damned fine setup for some $50, acccumulated a little at the time, from just the pole and American flag, to the addition of the crossbar and axtra flags.
