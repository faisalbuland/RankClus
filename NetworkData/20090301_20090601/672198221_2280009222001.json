The current fleet should be replaced soon since the only thing keeping these ancient choppers in the air is the magnificent maintenance by the ground crews. Sooner rather than later, the availability of replacement parts will ground these birds and no amount of hard work will keep them airborne. Since the president only flies short stints in Marine One, it does not have to have all of the bells and whistles the Agusta Westland product has. The Pentagon needs to pick an American helicopter to be the most visible whirlybird in the world. Bell, Sikorski and Boeing are quite capable of providing an aircraft that can transport the leader of the free world in the safety and comfort deserved by anyone in that position.",
