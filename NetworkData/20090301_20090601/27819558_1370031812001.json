I was young and patriotic, and proudly served a country I respected. All that changed forever when, shortly before I was discharged, a corpsman who had returned from the front lines only months before was given a bad-conduct discharge after being photographed leaving a gay bar. He kept his personal life private, so those of us who knew him did not know he was gay. He had returned from combat with a Bronze Star he received for pulling 26 wounded men off a hill under fire. He was quiet and humble and one of the best corpsmen I knew. Even to survive that kind of bravery was a monumental feat, and he considered it \"just part of the job.\" The bad-conduct discharge robbed him of his veterans benefits and left him feeling shame for exercising his God-given right to be himself. He was in civilian clothes, off base and off duty when he was caught. When the policy of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" was adopted, I knew that unsuspecting gays and lesbians would join the military believing that if they were discreet, they could serve their country and expect to be treated fairly. This policy was a bad idea from the start. It allows for persecution and discrimination in a setting that lends itself to cruelty. This has to stop. In addition to the obvious humanitarian reasons, the cost of training and then dismissing qualified, honorable and able men and women is an unconscionable misuse of millions -- perhaps billions -- of dollars of the military budget. Perhaps this money could be better spent on safety equipment to protect those who are willing to risk their lives to serve their country. The Seattle Times",

The VA is what media types regard as....an easy, large & slow moving target. Media is in the business of creating sensational, eye catching stories....regardless of truth. While it's true that less than honorable separations limit access of service personnel to SOME VA benefits, the implication of this story implies that redress is unavailable. The availability of benefits from the VA is adjudicated on a case by case basis when separations like BCD or Other than Honorable are given by military service departments. Service Organizations exist largely to protect our veterans from unfair adjudications. Further, we know that the military sometimes errs in their assignment of character of service designations. As such, a BCD is subject to review to determine if it was justified, and can be upgraded by the military branch that gave it. The critical element here is with the veteran; s/he must consult a professional who can advise the best approach to obtaining earned benefits.",

Even Veterans who were discharged honorably are often unaware of the benefits available to them. As with most articles, they are written to highlight a problem but fail to give a solution.",

Your career as a VSO, notwithstanding, does not qualify you to misquote military policy on character of discharge and separation review processes; however, my time as a personnel records specialist (75D), the many discharges I have overseen and my current occupation with the Department of Veterans Affairs does. It was not until 1979 that DoD was required by the courts in Giles v. Secretary of the Army (Civil Action No. 77-0904) to grant requests for review of separation with regard to character of discharge, but this was not to address mischaracterized discharges as a result of homosexual conduct. It was more for those involved in other illegal activities that caused them to forfeit their VA benefits. This process is not easy and it is certainly not automatic. In order for a former servicemember to be granted such a change, they have to prove that the discharge was not equitable; in other words it is not consistent with policies and traditions. They also have to prove that the character of discharge was improper; meaning that the reason or characterization of the discharge is in error (i.e., is false, or violates a regulation or a law). If you doubt that, please produce a single Chapter 15 discharge (Discharge for Homosexual Conduct, typically BCD, sometimes even Dishonorable) that was reviewed and recharacterized (to a more favorable character) prior to 1993 when DADT went into affect.",
