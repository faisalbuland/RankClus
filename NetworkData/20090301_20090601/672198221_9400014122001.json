Sgt. Matthis Chiroux, had served in the Army since 2002 and was a member of the Individual Ready Reserve when he was informed last year that he was being returned to active duty and sent to Iraq. He refused to participate in what he described as an \"illegal and immoral occupation.\" An administrative separation board at the Army Human Resources Command could grant Chiroux a general discharge or an other-than-honorable discharge, either of which could harm his ability to receive benefits available to honorably discharged veterans. Anti-war protesters plan to protest outside the hearing, which is not open to the public. About 60,000 soldiers serve in the Individual Ready Reserve. About 28,000 have mobilized since Sept. 11, 2001. About 400 received general or other than honorable discharges for failing to report for mobilization. An additional 1,500 cases are under investigation. A hearing for an honorable discharge you got to be joking. Failure to follow a written order for deployment. He should have a dishonorable and have to pay back all benefits and pay recieved. The oath is taken freely and while under it has to follow the orders of those above him. pls read the oath of military enlistment.",

Now you know damn well that you CAN post cold links here - Why don't you do so? As I said, those are serious charges you are making - Yet you can't substantiate them - Calling me names is only proof that you know who Einstein was. Now I am asked to substantiate what I say ALL THE TIME. I believe to ask is perfectly reasonable. No offense was intended - But you have to do better than post what could be called slander, based on your claim that it's true. Follow up - Kris Goldsmith, accoding to a blog that agree's with you[/I] said no such things... The author of the blog apologised for spreading BS. Dave[I] This message has been edited.
