Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times. To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick. Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files. \"In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,\" he declared. \"In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi ... I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.\" Mr. Bull said the \"clear purpose\" of what the Panthers were doing was to \"intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.\" He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: \"You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\" XXXhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/29/career-lawyers-overruled-on-voting-case/?feat=home_cube_position1XXX Huzzah for the new MSVN",

It only took a few moments and two panthers went to the hospital and the rest ran away. They never came back to Middle Town again. God I'm so proud to be part Italian.",

Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times. To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick. Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files. \"In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,\" he declared. \"In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi ... I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.\" Mr. Bull said the \"clear purpose\" of what the Panthers were doing was to \"intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.\" He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: \"You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\" XXXhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/29/career-lawyers-overruled-on-voting-case/?feat=home_cube_position1XXX Huzzah for the new MSVN",

Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times. To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick. Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files. \"In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,\" he declared. \"In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi ... I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.\" Mr. Bull said the \"clear purpose\" of what the Panthers were doing was to \"intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.\" He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: \"You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\" XXXhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/29/career-lawyers-overruled-on-voting-case/?feat=home_cube_position1XXX Huzzah for the new MSVN",

Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times. To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick. Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files. \"In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,\" he declared. \"In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi ... I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.\" Mr. Bull said the \"clear purpose\" of what the Panthers were doing was to \"intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.\" He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: \"You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\" XXXhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/29/career-lawyers-overruled-on-voting-case/?feat=home_cube_position1XXX Huzzah for the new MSVN",

Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times. To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick. Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files. \"In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,\" he declared. \"In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi ... I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.\" Mr. Bull said the \"clear purpose\" of what the Panthers were doing was to \"intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.\" He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: \"You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\" XXXhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/29/career-lawyers-overruled-on-voting-case/?feat=home_cube_position1XXX Huzzah for the new MSVN",

Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times. To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick. Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files. \"In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,\" he declared. \"In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi ... I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.\" Mr. Bull said the \"clear purpose\" of what the Panthers were doing was to \"intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.\" He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: \"You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\" XXXhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/29/career-lawyers-overruled-on-voting-case/?feat=home_cube_position1XXX Huzzah for the new MSVN",

Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times. To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick. Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files. \"In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,\" he declared. \"In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi ... I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.\" Mr. Bull said the \"clear purpose\" of what the Panthers were doing was to \"intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.\" He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: \"You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\" XXXhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/29/career-lawyers-overruled-on-voting-case/?feat=home_cube_position1XXX Huzzah for the new MSVN",
