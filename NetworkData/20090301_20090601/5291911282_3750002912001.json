We are suppose to walk every evening with the dog, but he told me his legs hurt. I know they don't because he doesn't have any trouble moving when he wants a coffee or something. I don't want to discipline him, but I am not sure what to do. My dh has talked to him, but he just ignores him. He is also doing some strange things. Someone wanted copies of his photographs during the war, and he told them that he can't have anything because everyone is trying to steal from him. Any suggestions.",

Since he's living with you, I'm guessing that he has lost his wife. If they had a successful marriage of years in length, then that, too, is distressful. Instead of \"disciplining\" him, go with him to his next doctor's appointment and the three of you (or four if your husband goes, too) can discuss the situation. Give the man privacy and dignity. Help him when he needs it, not pampering or treating him like a child. His space should be OFF LIMITS to you, your husband, your kids - unless/until he becomes unable to maintain basic sanitation. You can cook him all the right foods, but unless HE wants to do so, he'll eat what he damn well pleases. If you were my DIL and tried this on me, I'd slap you six ways from Sunday. (I know you're trying to do the right thing, but you're going about it the wrong way. Do some homework on Google or with your local Council on Aging. There's help out there - you just have to look for it.)",
