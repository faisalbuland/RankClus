Bush called former President Bill Clinton \"his brother\" and the two rarely disagreed in their first-ever appearance together on stage. The Republican and Democratic ex-presidents defended each other at a Toronto forum on Friday, disappointing some in the crowd of 6,000 who expected a more heated debate. Bush said that he never liked it when previous administration officials criticized his government but said Clinton was respectful and never did. Bush declined to criticize the Obama administration, in contrast to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has been a vocal critic of Obama. Bush, who wasn't asked about Cheney, said there are \"plenty of critics in America.\" Bush and Clinton did differ on Iraq. Clinton said U.N inspectors should have been given more time to conduct the search for weapons of mass destruction and Bush should have concentrated on Afghanistan. Bush disagreed. \"I don't buy the premise that our attention was diverted,\" Bush said... (...) He said, \"So brother, it's good to see you.\" Clinton and the elder Bush have worked together to lead fundraising after disasters such as the southeast Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and last summer's Hurricane Ike. While both Bush and Clinton received polite applause from the audience at Toronto's convention center, a couple hundred protesters demonstrated outside. The organizers declined to say how much the men were paid for the event, called \"A conversation with Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\" Ticket prices sold for C$200 to C$2,500. Bush joked about the speaking fees, which are normally lucrative for former presidents. (...) Asked why he didn't stop the killing in the Rwanda genocide when he was president in 1994, Clinton said he had no excuse or defense. \"It's one of the two or three greatest regrets of my presidency,\" Clinton said. Clinton said the U.S. could have saved 250,000 or 400,000 of the 800,000 people who died had he sent about 20,000 troops. Bush defended Clinton, saying 20,000 troops could not have been mobilized quickly. Clinton praised Bush for his AIDS initiatives and also hailed the racial and ethnic diversity of his cabinet choices. (...) A genuine burying of the hatchet? Or does it seem more like this is simply for the sake of appearances?",

'Brothers in bad times' -after the fact- and walking away with 'regrets' (even if only two, or three) are hardly indicative of having 'done the best you can'. Maybe if the America was represented with more charity and honesty while in office, chiefs wouldn't have to represent it with excuses and explanations afterward.",
