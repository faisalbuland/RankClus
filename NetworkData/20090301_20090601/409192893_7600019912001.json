        "content": "What's happening is that the accounting rules are changing and that's all. Under the old mark to market rules, any institution holding mortgages, whether in arrears or not, had to value those mortgages for reporting purposes at the current, estimated market value, not the amount of the loan. That meant those institutions had to claim the huge \"losses\" between the estimated value of the house and the amount actually loaned on it. And, they had to do that with every property they held a mortgage on, whether or not the occupants were making payments on time. Consequently, what happened was the loaners APPEARED to be virtually broke when, in fact, they were not and are not. There would be no actual loss unless the bank foreclosed on the property and sold it immediately for the estimated going rate. It's very similar to claiming a \"loss\" because the value of your stock has gone down on paper when, in fact, you have not yet sold them, which would turn a paper loss into a real loss. I personally think that returning to the more logical reporting rules of allowing a bank to show the full value of the money loaned will go a long way toward \"solving\" the housing crisis. After all, they do not take a real loss until, and unless, that property is foreclosed upon. If that happens, they can then accurately report a real loss.",
