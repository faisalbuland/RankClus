Hell, an unloaded firearm is a melee weapon. Living in a country where you don't have the right to own firearms as a citizen, Jakob, I understand that you have to \"make do\".. but any US citizen who chooses a club over a gun for home defense is just a fool imo. And don't forget, the intruder may be packing some bang-bang of his own.. you gonna take that on with a bat? Good luck. You are quite right, that outside with clear and open lines of fire it would not be a good idea to go up against a gunman with a baseball bat. But we are talking about home defense here, not a shootout on the main street at noon. and home defence is rather a different situation. \"Good is better than bad cause its nicer\" Mammy Yokum (as related by Al Capp)",
