Bills, aren't necessary, what are necessary, are those deserving suffering Veteran's who sacrificed and gave so much for their Country, be recognized expeditiously as possible and provided the treatment and benefits befitting a heroic effort on their part to protect our way of life. I agree only that a process be implemented, to relieve a system so clogged and overwhelmed with disengenuine claims. this can be accomplished simply by submitting a plan on the lines of, Hiring Qualified Doctors to, Cipher through claims and challenge any material not meeting the requirements of legitimacy.

I'm fairly certain over the years you as well as myself have witnessed (through many years of group and other social participation) the behavior of those who just weren't genuine when interpreting their actual stress levels when describing events in Vietnam. This problem exist to this very day. Vote seeking Politicians, are agreeing with anything that passes itself off in a positive manner. Things such as: Bills that make PTSD automatic once a GI sets foot in a hostile Country. Making it unnecessary to prove a mental deficiency of any kind. This solution to assist Veterans seeking Care and claims is only adding to make this problematic condition even worse. Not everybody who served in a combat zone is entitled to benefits. Combat Veterans, who are deserving of aide usually find it relatively easy to accomplish this task. Documentation is provided upon request. Should verification requiring medical history be necessary, it is easily obtainable. What is becoming difficult are all the disengenuine Claims being submitted for PTSD. I can honestly attest to why many individuals over exaggerated their presents in a hostile area (never in a combat situation). I don't feel it necessary to explain. After many years attending group environments and other stress related settings, It's very obvious through the remarks of some participants that their presents could be viewed as something other then genuine. I hope you can see this as a crusade to better serve those with verifiable Disorders be given priority for treatment and other needs. These soldiers, deserve the respect and immediate attention necessary to settle any legitimate actions required and not be bog down in a process wasted on filtering claims that are not genuine. Surely, Graywolf, you can understand where I'm coming from. If not let me know and I'll explain another way. May not sound as nice, however, maybe it'll wake a few people up and see what's happening to our system. ***email address is removed*** all communications must be made through the profile page send option.

I will attempt to finish where I believe It was interrupted. It was along the lines of: our elected Officials, not wanting to say anything that might upset the new Majority in this Country, the 20 or so million Illegal Immigrants. It's my belief no offensive or rhetorical remarks are forth coming because, they're over populating the Country and eventually will succeed with this quest because our Government keeps supplying them with the means to do so. These means consist of: Welfare, Free Housing, Stamps and whatever is necessary to keep them BREEDING. Once the products of breeding are realized they become Legal because, you guessed it, born on our soil. By Breeding they become eligible for better benefits then Americans get and will be allowed to stay with the illiterate brat. Of course our Officials aren't stopping anything, which in turn encourages this behavior. Their weak, afraid of offending or making a disparaging remark. Just witness all the apologies that are continuously delivered to these Illegal masses. Wake up Government people, were being made fools of. The Blacks did it, and who better do the immigrants have to learn from. Look how far they've come. They've been out populating us 90 to 1, not caring who the babie's daddy is, just as long as their plan is realized. Their plan is simple, just like yours, bankrupt the Government, by over populating the whites by so many they'll never catch up, and get all the Welfare, Housing and freebies you can. If nothing is done, we'll have the next ethnicity in place. I'm not necessarily opposed to anyone sticking it to the Government, but Dam, you'd think our Politicians would've learned a lesson by now. Please, don't think me a racist, I'm not. Black, White, blue, anything, I hate you all if you're not compatible with me. This message has been edited.
