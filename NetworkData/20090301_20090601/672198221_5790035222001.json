        "content": "Apparent pressure from the White House has forced U.S. Rep. John Murtha to withdraw his proposal to split a $40 billion Air Force tanker contract between Boeing Co., and Northrop Grumman Corp. Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reported late last week that the White House stymied Murtha's plan by convincing congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to oppose the dual buy. Boeing, which lost out to Northrop in the initial contact award last year, is headquartered in Chicago, the hometown of President Barack Obama, and his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. Northrop, along with its European partner EADS, has plans to build a $600 million aircraft assembly plant in Mobile if it wins the contract to build 173 tankers. If Northrop were to win all or part of the contract, it would have a huge impact on the economies of Mobile and Pensacola, producing some 1,500 high-wage jobs, and attracting several hundred parts suppliers to the central Gulf Coast area. Northrop's plans have drawn broad support from local elected officials in the Pensacola area.

The only benefit I can see is it would determine which acft bests suites the need. But the downside is by the time that is learned, both models would be obsolete for the KC-Y and KC-Z competitions. And while the Gulf Coast would benefit from EADS winning, other parts of the country would lay workers off. persoannly, since the USAF is looking to replace the KC-135E models, buy the 767 since it meets the need and would be less expensive up front. If a MRTT is what is needed, say that or ut the requirement off until the next round of tanker purchases. After all, there are 537 KC-135s that need replacement and 59 KC-10s by the time all is said and done.",
