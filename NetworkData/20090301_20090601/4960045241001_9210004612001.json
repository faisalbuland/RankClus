The Constitution doesn't require one's mother to be an \"adult\" in order to meet the qualifications for holding the office of POTUS. Nor does it state that one's mother must be a resident of Hawaii in order to become President. I'm still reading the Constitution but I can't find anything regarding Kenyan, Arab, polygamous Moslems - please fill me in! There are an awful lot of juvenile \"adults\" on this forum.",

That is because sensible people respect evidence a lot more than they respect T-shirts with unsubstantiated allegations.
