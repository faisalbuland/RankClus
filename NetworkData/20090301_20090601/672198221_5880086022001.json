        "content": "wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=94803 WASHINGTON \u2013 A newly unclassified Department of Homeland Security report warns against the possibility of violence by unnamed \"right-wing extremists\" concerned about illegal immigration, increasing federal power, restrictions on firearms, abortion and the loss of U.S. sovereignty and singles out returning war veterans as particular threats. The report, titled \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" dated April 7, states that \"threats from white supremacist and violent anti-government groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts.\" However, the document, first reported by talk-radio host and WND columnist Roger Hedgecock, goes on to suggest worsening economic woes, potential new legislative restrictions on firearms and \"the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\" Are you ready for a second Declaration of Independence? Sign the petition promoting true freedom once again! The report from DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.\" \"[T]he consequences of a prolonged economic downturn \u2013 including real estate foreclosures, unemployment and an inability to obtain credit \u2013 could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past,\" the report says. It adds that \"growth in these groups subsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as a result of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and disrupted plots, improvements in the economy and the continued U.S. standing as the pre-eminent world power.\" \"Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government,\" the report continues. \"The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.\" Most notable is the report's focus on the impact of returning war veterans. \"Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists,\" it says. \"DHS/I&A is concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities.\" The report cites the April 4 shooting deaths of three police officers in Pittsburgh as an example of what may be coming, claiming the alleged gunman holds a racist ideology and believes in anti-government conspiracy theories about gun confiscations, citizen detention camps and \"a Jewish-controlled 'one-world government.'\" It also suggests the election of an African-American president and the prospect of his policy changes \"are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.\" The report also mentions \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.\" \"DHS/I&A assesses that right-wing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,\" the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with \"radical\" ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to \"take a hard look\" at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. \"My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,\" he wrote. \"Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.\" \"For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,\" he said. \"Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.\"",

In 1923, when the Ku Klux Klan still yielded unspeakable influence in this country, The American Legion passed Resolution 407. It resolved, in part, \u201c\u2026we consider any individual, group of individuals or organizations, which creates, or fosters racial, religious or class strife among our people, or which takes into their own hands the enforcement of law, determination of guilt, or infliction of punishment, to be un-American, a menace to our liberties, and destructive to our fundamental law\u2026\u201d The best that I can say about your recent report is that it is incomplete. The report states, without any statistical evidence, \u201cThe possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\u201d The American Legion is well aware and horrified at the pain inflicted during the Oklahoma City bombing, but Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation\u2019s uniform during wartime. To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical \u201cdisgruntled military veteran\u201d is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam. Your report states that \u201cRightwing extremists were concerned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away American jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages.\u201d Secretary Napolitano, this is more than a perception to those who have lost their job. Would you categorize union members as \u201cRight Wing extremists\u201d? In spite of this incomplete, and, I fear, politically-biased report, The American Legion and the Department of Homeland Security share many common and crucial interests, such as the Citizen Corps and disaster preparedness. Since you are a graduate of New Mexico Girls State, I trust that you are very familiar with The American Legion. I would be happy to meet with you at a time of mutual convenience to discuss issues such as border security and the war on terrorism. I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are. Sincerely, David K. Rehbein National Commander The American Legion",

The report, titled \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" dated April 7, states that \"threats from white supremacist and violent anti-government groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts.\" However, the document, first reported by talk-radio host and WND columnist Roger Hedgecock, goes on to suggest worsening economic woes, potential new legislative restrictions on firearms and \"the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\" Are you ready for a second Declaration of Independence? Sign the petition promoting true freedom once again! The report from DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.\" \"[T]he consequences of a prolonged economic downturn \u2013 including real estate foreclosures, unemployment and an inability to obtain credit \u2013 could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past,\" the report says. It adds that \"growth in these groups subsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as a result of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and disrupted plots, improvements in the economy and the continued U.S. standing as the pre-eminent world power.\" \"Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government,\" the report continues. \"The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.\" Most notable is the report's focus on the impact of returning war veterans. \"Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists,\" it says. \"DHS/I&A is concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities.\" The report cites the April 4 shooting deaths of three police officers in Pittsburgh as an example of what may be coming, claiming the alleged gunman holds a racist ideology and believes in anti-government conspiracy theories about gun confiscations, citizen detention camps and \"a Jewish-controlled 'one-world government.'\" It also suggests the election of an African-American president and the prospect of his policy changes \"are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.\" The report also mentions \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.\" \"DHS/I&A assesses that right-wing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,\" the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with \"radical\" ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to \"take a hard look\" at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. \"My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,\" he wrote. \"Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.\" \"For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,\" he said. \"Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.\"",

In 1923, when the Ku Klux Klan still yielded unspeakable influence in this country, The American Legion passed Resolution 407. It resolved, in part, \u201c\u2026we consider any individual, group of individuals or organizations, which creates, or fosters racial, religious or class strife among our people, or which takes into their own hands the enforcement of law, determination of guilt, or infliction of punishment, to be un-American, a menace to our liberties, and destructive to our fundamental law\u2026\u201d The best that I can say about your recent report is that it is incomplete. The report states, without any statistical evidence, \u201cThe possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\u201d The American Legion is well aware and horrified at the pain inflicted during the Oklahoma City bombing, but Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation\u2019s uniform during wartime. To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical \u201cdisgruntled military veteran\u201d is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam. Your report states that \u201cRightwing extremists were concerned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away American jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages.\u201d Secretary Napolitano, this is more than a perception to those who have lost their job. Would you categorize union members as \u201cRight Wing extremists\u201d? In spite of this incomplete, and, I fear, politically-biased report, The American Legion and the Department of Homeland Security share many common and crucial interests, such as the Citizen Corps and disaster preparedness. Since you are a graduate of New Mexico Girls State, I trust that you are very familiar with The American Legion. I would be happy to meet with you at a time of mutual convenience to discuss issues such as border security and the war on terrorism. I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are. Sincerely, David K. Rehbein National Commander The American Legion",

        "content": "wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=94803 WASHINGTON \u2013 A newly unclassified Department of Homeland Security report warns against the possibility of violence by unnamed \"right-wing extremists\" concerned about illegal immigration, increasing federal power, restrictions on firearms, abortion and the loss of U.S. sovereignty and singles out returning war veterans as particular threats. The report, titled \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" dated April 7, states that \"threats from white supremacist and violent anti-government groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts.\" However, the document, first reported by talk-radio host and WND columnist Roger Hedgecock, goes on to suggest worsening economic woes, potential new legislative restrictions on firearms and \"the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\" Are you ready for a second Declaration of Independence? Sign the petition promoting true freedom once again! The report from DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.\" \"[T]he consequences of a prolonged economic downturn \u2013 including real estate foreclosures, unemployment and an inability to obtain credit \u2013 could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past,\" the report says. It adds that \"growth in these groups subsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as a result of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and disrupted plots, improvements in the economy and the continued U.S. standing as the pre-eminent world power.\" \"Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government,\" the report continues. \"The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.\" Most notable is the report's focus on the impact of returning war veterans. \"Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists,\" it says. \"DHS/I&A is concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities.\" The report cites the April 4 shooting deaths of three police officers in Pittsburgh as an example of what may be coming, claiming the alleged gunman holds a racist ideology and believes in anti-government conspiracy theories about gun confiscations, citizen detention camps and \"a Jewish-controlled 'one-world government.'\" It also suggests the election of an African-American president and the prospect of his policy changes \"are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.\" The report also mentions \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.\" \"DHS/I&A assesses that right-wing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,\" the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with \"radical\" ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to \"take a hard look\" at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. \"My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,\" he wrote. \"Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.\" \"For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,\" he said. \"Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.\"",

In 1923, when the Ku Klux Klan still yielded unspeakable influence in this country, The American Legion passed Resolution 407. It resolved, in part, \u201c\u2026we consider any individual, group of individuals or organizations, which creates, or fosters racial, religious or class strife among our people, or which takes into their own hands the enforcement of law, determination of guilt, or infliction of punishment, to be un-American, a menace to our liberties, and destructive to our fundamental law\u2026\u201d The best that I can say about your recent report is that it is incomplete. The report states, without any statistical evidence, \u201cThe possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\u201d The American Legion is well aware and horrified at the pain inflicted during the Oklahoma City bombing, but Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation\u2019s uniform during wartime. To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical \u201cdisgruntled military veteran\u201d is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam. Your report states that \u201cRightwing extremists were concerned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away American jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages.\u201d Secretary Napolitano, this is more than a perception to those who have lost their job. Would you categorize union members as \u201cRight Wing extremists\u201d? In spite of this incomplete, and, I fear, politically-biased report, The American Legion and the Department of Homeland Security share many common and crucial interests, such as the Citizen Corps and disaster preparedness. Since you are a graduate of New Mexico Girls State, I trust that you are very familiar with The American Legion. I would be happy to meet with you at a time of mutual convenience to discuss issues such as border security and the war on terrorism. I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are. Sincerely, David K. Rehbein National Commander The American Legion",

        "content": "wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=94803 WASHINGTON \u2013 A newly unclassified Department of Homeland Security report warns against the possibility of violence by unnamed \"right-wing extremists\" concerned about illegal immigration, increasing federal power, restrictions on firearms, abortion and the loss of U.S. sovereignty and singles out returning war veterans as particular threats. The report, titled \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" dated April 7, states that \"threats from white supremacist and violent anti-government groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts.\" However, the document, first reported by talk-radio host and WND columnist Roger Hedgecock, goes on to suggest worsening economic woes, potential new legislative restrictions on firearms and \"the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\" Are you ready for a second Declaration of Independence? Sign the petition promoting true freedom once again! The report from DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.\" \"[T]he consequences of a prolonged economic downturn \u2013 including real estate foreclosures, unemployment and an inability to obtain credit \u2013 could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past,\" the report says. It adds that \"growth in these groups subsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as a result of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and disrupted plots, improvements in the economy and the continued U.S. standing as the pre-eminent world power.\" \"Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government,\" the report continues. \"The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.\" Most notable is the report's focus on the impact of returning war veterans. \"Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists,\" it says. \"DHS/I&A is concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities.\" The report cites the April 4 shooting deaths of three police officers in Pittsburgh as an example of what may be coming, claiming the alleged gunman holds a racist ideology and believes in anti-government conspiracy theories about gun confiscations, citizen detention camps and \"a Jewish-controlled 'one-world government.'\" It also suggests the election of an African-American president and the prospect of his policy changes \"are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.\" The report also mentions \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.\" \"DHS/I&A assesses that right-wing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,\" the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with \"radical\" ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to \"take a hard look\" at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. \"My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,\" he wrote. \"Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.\" \"For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,\" he said. \"Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.\"",

In 1923, when the Ku Klux Klan still yielded unspeakable influence in this country, The American Legion passed Resolution 407. It resolved, in part, \u201c\u2026we consider any individual, group of individuals or organizations, which creates, or fosters racial, religious or class strife among our people, or which takes into their own hands the enforcement of law, determination of guilt, or infliction of punishment, to be un-American, a menace to our liberties, and destructive to our fundamental law\u2026\u201d The best that I can say about your recent report is that it is incomplete. The report states, without any statistical evidence, \u201cThe possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\u201d The American Legion is well aware and horrified at the pain inflicted during the Oklahoma City bombing, but Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation\u2019s uniform during wartime. To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical \u201cdisgruntled military veteran\u201d is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam. Your report states that \u201cRightwing extremists were concerned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away American jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages.\u201d Secretary Napolitano, this is more than a perception to those who have lost their job. Would you categorize union members as \u201cRight Wing extremists\u201d? In spite of this incomplete, and, I fear, politically-biased report, The American Legion and the Department of Homeland Security share many common and crucial interests, such as the Citizen Corps and disaster preparedness. Since you are a graduate of New Mexico Girls State, I trust that you are very familiar with The American Legion. I would be happy to meet with you at a time of mutual convenience to discuss issues such as border security and the war on terrorism. I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are. Sincerely, David K. Rehbein National Commander The American Legion",

        "content": "wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=94803 WASHINGTON \u2013 A newly unclassified Department of Homeland Security report warns against the possibility of violence by unnamed \"right-wing extremists\" concerned about illegal immigration, increasing federal power, restrictions on firearms, abortion and the loss of U.S. sovereignty and singles out returning war veterans as particular threats. The report, titled \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" dated April 7, states that \"threats from white supremacist and violent anti-government groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts.\" However, the document, first reported by talk-radio host and WND columnist Roger Hedgecock, goes on to suggest worsening economic woes, potential new legislative restrictions on firearms and \"the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\" Are you ready for a second Declaration of Independence? Sign the petition promoting true freedom once again! The report from DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.\" \"[T]he consequences of a prolonged economic downturn \u2013 including real estate foreclosures, unemployment and an inability to obtain credit \u2013 could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past,\" the report says. It adds that \"growth in these groups subsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as a result of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and disrupted plots, improvements in the economy and the continued U.S. standing as the pre-eminent world power.\" \"Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government,\" the report continues. \"The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.\" Most notable is the report's focus on the impact of returning war veterans. \"Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists,\" it says. \"DHS/I&A is concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities.\" The report cites the April 4 shooting deaths of three police officers in Pittsburgh as an example of what may be coming, claiming the alleged gunman holds a racist ideology and believes in anti-government conspiracy theories about gun confiscations, citizen detention camps and \"a Jewish-controlled 'one-world government.'\" It also suggests the election of an African-American president and the prospect of his policy changes \"are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.\" The report also mentions \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.\" \"DHS/I&A assesses that right-wing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,\" the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with \"radical\" ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to \"take a hard look\" at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. \"My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,\" he wrote. \"Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.\" \"For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,\" he said. \"Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.\"",

To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical \u201cdisgruntled military veteran\u201d is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam. Your report states that \u201cRightwing extremists were concerned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away American jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages.\u201d Secretary Napolitano, this is more than a perception to those who have lost their job. Would you categorize union members as \u201cRight Wing extremists\u201d? In spite of this incomplete, and, I fear, politically-biased report, The American Legion and the Department of Homeland Security share many common and crucial interests, such as the Citizen Corps and disaster preparedness. Since you are a graduate of New Mexico Girls State, I trust that you are very familiar with The American Legion. I would be happy to meet with you at a time of mutual convenience to discuss issues such as border security and the war on terrorism.

        "content": "wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=94803 WASHINGTON \u2013 A newly unclassified Department of Homeland Security report warns against the possibility of violence by unnamed \"right-wing extremists\" concerned about illegal immigration, increasing federal power, restrictions on firearms, abortion and the loss of U.S. sovereignty and singles out returning war veterans as particular threats. The report, titled \"Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" dated April 7, states that \"threats from white supremacist and violent anti-government groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts.\" However, the document, first reported by talk-radio host and WND columnist Roger Hedgecock, goes on to suggest worsening economic woes, potential new legislative restrictions on firearms and \"the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\" Are you ready for a second Declaration of Independence? Sign the petition promoting true freedom once again! The report from DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis defines right-wing extremism in the U.S. as \"divided into those groups, movements and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.\" \"[T]he consequences of a prolonged economic downturn \u2013 including real estate foreclosures, unemployment and an inability to obtain credit \u2013 could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past,\" the report says. It adds that \"growth in these groups subsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as a result of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and disrupted plots, improvements in the economy and the continued U.S. standing as the pre-eminent world power.\" \"Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government,\" the report continues. \"The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.\" Most notable is the report's focus on the impact of returning war veterans. \"Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists,\" it says. \"DHS/I&A is concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities.\" The report cites the April 4 shooting deaths of three police officers in Pittsburgh as an example of what may be coming, claiming the alleged gunman holds a racist ideology and believes in anti-government conspiracy theories about gun confiscations, citizen detention camps and \"a Jewish-controlled 'one-world government.'\" It also suggests the election of an African-American president and the prospect of his policy changes \"are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.\" The report also mentions \"'end times' prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.\" \"DHS/I&A assesses that right-wing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,\" the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with \"radical\" ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to \"take a hard look\" at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. \"My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,\" he wrote. \"Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.\" \"For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,\" he said. \"Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.\"",

These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.\" \"DHS/I&A assesses that right-wing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,\" the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with \"radical\" ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to \"take a hard look\" at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. \"My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,\" he wrote. \"Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.\" \"For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,\" he said. \"Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.\"",

In 1923, when the Ku Klux Klan still yielded unspeakable influence in this country, The American Legion passed Resolution 407. It resolved, in part, \u201c\u2026we consider any individual, group of individuals or organizations, which creates, or fosters racial, religious or class strife among our people, or which takes into their own hands the enforcement of law, determination of guilt, or infliction of punishment, to be un-American, a menace to our liberties, and destructive to our fundamental law\u2026\u201d The best that I can say about your recent report is that it is incomplete. The report states, without any statistical evidence, \u201cThe possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\u201d The American Legion is well aware and horrified at the pain inflicted during the Oklahoma City bombing, but Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation\u2019s uniform during wartime. To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical \u201cdisgruntled military veteran\u201d is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam. Your report states that \u201cRightwing extremists were concerned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away American jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages.\u201d Secretary Napolitano, this is more than a perception to those who have lost their job. Would you categorize union members as \u201cRight Wing extremists\u201d? In spite of this incomplete, and, I fear, politically-biased report, The American Legion and the Department of Homeland Security share many common and crucial interests, such as the Citizen Corps and disaster preparedness. Since you are a graduate of New Mexico Girls State, I trust that you are very familiar with The American Legion. I would be happy to meet with you at a time of mutual convenience to discuss issues such as border security and the war on terrorism. I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are. Sincerely, David K. Rehbein National Commander The American Legion",

It resolved, in part, \u201c\u2026we consider any individual, group of individuals or organizations, which creates, or fosters racial, religious or class strife among our people, or which takes into their own hands the enforcement of law, determination of guilt, or infliction of punishment, to be un-American, a menace to our liberties, and destructive to our fundamental law\u2026\u201d The best that I can say about your recent report is that it is incomplete. The report states, without any statistical evidence, \u201cThe possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.\u201d The American Legion is well aware and horrified at the pain inflicted during the Oklahoma City bombing, but Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation\u2019s uniform during wartime. To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical \u201cdisgruntled military veteran\u201d is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam. Your report states that \u201cRightwing extremists were concerned during the 1990s with the perception that illegal immigrants were taking away American jobs through their willingness to work at significantly lower wages.\u201d Secretary Napolitano, this is more than a perception to those who have lost their job. Would you categorize union members as \u201cRight Wing extremists\u201d? In spite of this incomplete, and, I fear, politically-biased report, The American Legion and the Department of Homeland Security share many common and crucial interests, such as the Citizen Corps and disaster preparedness. Since you are a graduate of New Mexico Girls State, I trust that you are very familiar with The American Legion. I would be happy to meet with you at a time of mutual convenience to discuss issues such as border security and the war on terrorism. I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are. Sincerely, David K. Rehbein National Commander The American Legion",

You think returning war vets not being happy is something new? can't wait to see how the VA will have to report disgruntled Vets to DHS, now. VA: So, you're not happy? Vet: No Ma'am.
