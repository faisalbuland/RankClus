It's something that is demonstrated by track record. And, yes, those issues of abortion, big govt, gun control, fiscal responsibility, personal responsibility, etc. are all very important. These things get developed over a period of time by voting and other public stances. I'm not sure a convenient little checklist where there are ten items where all or 5 or 8 have to be checked in order to arrive at the label.
