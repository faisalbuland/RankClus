Doubt it duster, Memorial Day originated from Decoration Day back in the 1880s when flowers were put on Union graves. The South had their own day but when it change to Memorial Day, it then combined the WWI dead, it became the national day for rememberence.. Veteran's Day originated from Rememberence Day, Nov 11 1918. Most allied countries use that day for their Memorial Day as they call Rememberence Day. Since we already had May 30, originally, we turned Nov 11th into Vet's Day, signed into law by Eisenhower. I think both are here to stay...as is. BTW, I bought my poppy today.",
