Loran said I was over the airport, caught a glimpse of it thru a small break in cloud an circled around to land into the wind. Flying by Loran only now,it said I was at end of runway an I put the airplane in a slip an burst under the cloud at 600 an slipped it in. Stood on the brakes and the tail fishtailed but I controlled it with foot pedales. Runway was only like 2800 feet FOB operator said that was the closest to a real carrier landing he ever saw. Scarey!
