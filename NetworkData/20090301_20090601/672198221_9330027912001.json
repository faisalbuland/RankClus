Osher Doctorow It would be a neat trick to \"bomb them back into the stone ages.\" Where exactely are the factories to eliminate? They're already living in the stone age, and that's part of the problem. And you are attacking what would be the main component of ANY succesfull war in Afghanistan. The problem is NOT that we built roads and bridges, the problem is that even though we promised them, we didn't deliver. Instead we took all our resources and put them in Iraq. For every penny we invested in Afghanistan we spent a dollar in Iraq. Instead of picking out men and woman with an interest in defeating hard line fundamentalism, we CHOOSE to support hard line fundamentalists and Dope dealers. Finally, on the question of cooperating with Iran against the common enemy, Al Qaeda, we would be damnd stupid not to take advantage of their self interest, at least on THIS question. Dave",
