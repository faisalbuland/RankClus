At $6.55 per hour for 40 hours a week that equals $262 per week per employee or $524 a week total in extra costs to the employer. 56 weeks in a year times $524 equals an extra cost of $29,344 per year to the employer. That is a substantial cost to a small business that will not be absorbed by the business but made up for in other ways like price increases or layoffs.",

AND AGAIN, did you ever own or run a business? Unfortunately, you miss the point as well. It's called taking care of a nation, not the almighty dollar bill. The dollar bill fights for and defends no one. The dollar bill does not run and jump in to a lake to rescue someone, the dollar bill does not climb a burning building to rescue someone, the dollar bill does not put their lives on the line, heal the sick, help their neighbor, the dollar bill does absolutely nothing but sit there and entrance people to want more and more. How could you not read and understand and appreciate the words of one of the greatest Presidents this nation has ever had? I understand perfectly what you are saying, and I say this, America is going to hell and a hand basket because of that dollar bill and that ideology is exactly what's helping it get there. The bussiness world will come to an end just because people will be allowed 5 days of paid vacation...were all doomed.",
