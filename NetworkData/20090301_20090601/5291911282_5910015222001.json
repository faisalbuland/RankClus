Liberal Justice David Souter, 69, announced last week that he is planning to retire at the end of the Supreme Court's current term. Souter, who was appointed by George H.W. Bush, has served on the high court since October 1990. This part removed.. For complete story use url below.. \"[President Obama] has said that he's looking for a judicial activist,\" says Levey. \"He didn't use that actual word. He said he's looking for a judge who shows empathy by favoring certain groups -- pregnant women, minorities, so on, and so forth. That is the definition of judicial activism -- outcome-oriented judging.\" Levey hopes Obama will pick a nominee based on their qualifications -- not their gender, race, or sexual orientation. \"I don't think it will be Hillary Clinton,\" he responds when asked. \"It may certainly be Elena Kagan or Sonia Sotomayor [Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals], since he probably wants to appoint the first Hispanic justice. It could be Kathleen Sullivan, law professor and former dean at Stanford. It could be Diane Wood on the Seventh Circuit. I do think it will be a woman.\" Levey notes that two of President Obama's potential picks -- current Solicitor General Elena Kagan and Kathleen Sullivan -- are open lesbians. Levey says people in red and purple states need to remind their senators that they want a judicial nominee who both supports their values and the rule of law. *http://www.onenewsnow.com/Politics/Default.aspx?id=513222* SEABEE'S \"CAN DO\", \"HAVE DONE\", AND WILL DO SO FOREVER.

These are supposed to be Jurists, without political bias of consideration - but only and eye to the Constitution...right or wrong? So anything added into the the selection process beyond that is a perversion of the process and concept - - It is an imperfect selection process in an imperfect world, but can a potential employer ask for your race, gender, political persuasion, sexual preference, and stance on marriage or abortion before hiring you?? Then aren't those very prejudice/bias questions to be thinking about while selecting a Supreme Court Justice??? If not, then the perfect choice MUST be a homosexual female of Mexican descent, who has a live-in lover from some other minority - - Legal experience and Constitutional expertise is a non-sequitur Wandering and Wondering",

Apparently, Mr. Obama cannot state the same. Rich -- babe. Did Mr. Obama ever \"state the same\" ?? If he did, then let's start the debate there. Show me his quoted statements. If he did indeed make those comments, then I will join you in the criticism. But so far, all I see are \"experts\" and \"opinion pieces\" agitating the masses. Actually, if you'll read my first post on this matter, you'll find that I did indeed purport a hope that he will not follow his advisers: quote: I sincerely he hope that he is willing to be different and that all this speculation is just hype. That Mr. Obama will consider the rule of the law that makes discrimination illegal. However, we are naive to think that he will ignore their advice and choose against the wishes of his own cabinet staff. To me, \"Obama\" isn't reflective of any one man's decision - it encompasses his entire administration. So when I use it, I am abbreviating \"President Obama's Administration's Decision.\" For now. When he does choose, then any praise or criticism will be inclusive of him alone as it is his decision alone. But GWG is right: they should be voted in by the people, not by the sitting administration. It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

If only women are being considered, then that is indeed sexism against men. 2. The SCOTUS is currently more representative of the \"white male\" demographic than any others. That does not mean we should not consider qualified white males... but it might indicate past unfairness in the selection process. You can not \"fix\" this with \"reverse discrimination\" (I hate that term), but moving forwards, it would be good to consider a diverse pool of candidates as a starting point each time a new appointee is considered. 3. FollowMeInfantry, you're usually correct on many things, but you got one of your facts wrong. You said: quote: Why is it against the law for me to refuse to hire a lesbian but within the law for him to hire one because of it? That's actually false. It is NOT against federal laws to refuse to hire a lesbian (or a gay man) based solely on sexual orientation. Some states have laws against it, but the majority of states do not. Essentially, in most of the United States, is it perfectly LEGAL to intentionally discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. I wonder what would happen if a gay CEO were to intentionally discriminate against a straight potential employee? Just a theoretical situation, of course, but I do wonder.",
