The Air Force didn't take care of those of that worked there anyway. They shut down the dining facility, and it was taken over by a contractor as more of a fast food place. It would cost 5 or 6 dollars to get a burger and fries, compared to what should be $2.40 in a DFAC. There were no MPF services in the mountain, only at Peterson. Well Petersons MPF hours went to 0900-1500 (to accomadate PT and training), and considering it takes 30 minutes to go to Pete from the mountain that was a big chunk out of a work day and going on your way in or leaving wasn't an option because the desk jockeys couldn't be bothered to do PT before work.",
