Jasim, whose name is being withheld for his safety, has received strong support from the U.S. military, and the Department of Homeland Security approved his application for a visa. But the State Department has denied Jasim a visa because he was arrested in 1996 for actions against the Saddam dictatorship. . . Because Iraqi translators are seen by jihadists and former Baathists as \"traitors,\" Jasim's life is at greater risk the longer he stays in Iraq, according to multiple State Department and U.S. military officials. A number of translators and their families have already been tortured and/or murdered. . . U.S. military officials familiar with Jasim's case believe that he will be in even greater danger after U.S. forces withdraw from most of Iraq next year. The State Department, meanwhile, has told Jasim that he must wait three more years before he can apply for a waiver of its visa rejection. . . During his three years as a translator, Jasim has exposed himself to enemy fire in the course of saving American lives. Three different Americans who served with him in Iraq told FOXNews.com that they are alive today because of Jasim. \"The only reason I am here today is because of Jasim,\" said Elisabeth Keene, a U.S. Army specialist who serves in a combat unit. \"He saved the life of everyone in my unit. \"On several occasions while our guys were putting rounds down range, Jasim put himself in harm's way to pull the wounded out and treat them,\" Keene said. \"Jasim is a hero to everyone he has ever met.\" \"I owe my life to Jasim ... hands down,\" said Master Sgt. Jason Krieger, who went on over 200 combat patrols with Jasim. \"I consider him a brother, not only in arms, but in love as well.\" Those who have worked with Jasim are astonished at the decision to deny him a visa. FOXNews.com has obtained numerous letters submitted by U.S. Army and Marine Corps personnel supporting his application. Each letter praises his heroism in glowing terms and strongly recommends issuing a visa. Jasim even received letters of recommendation from a couple of two-star generals. It is unusual for a translator's visa application to be endorsed even by one general. U.S. Army Captain Joseph Schwankhaus wrote about one day in particular when Jasim performed multiple heroic acts. \"While establishing security positions around a patrol that was struck by an IED, [Jasim] singlehandedly removed a wounded soldier from a disabled vehicle and ensured that he was treated by the company medic. During this security cordon, another soldier was shot in the head by a sniper and a large fire fight ensued. [Jasim], while under direct enemy fire provided cover for the wounded soldier while medical personnel rendered life-saving first aid.\" Schwankhaus stated emphatically, \"His dedication to my soldiers and his total disregard for his own personal safety assisted in saving the life of a very good Non-Commissioned Officer.\" . . It's a concern shared by Americans who have served with him. \"To deprive him of his opportunity to protect his family, after he had protected mine for well over a year, is nothing short of criminal,\" said Master Sgt. Krieger. \"Every day he remains in Iraq, he, his wife, and newborn son are at risk of death, solely due to his service to our country.\" <much more> \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,512422,00.html\" Way to go Hillary ...",

Qwert I know you have some experience with the federal government so I am sure you know it will take some time before the change will become apparent. I will buy off on your comment about past administrations, but what makes you so sure that the State Department is not acting correctly? Sound like something trumped up so the right has to be outraged over. Fact is the guy could be a not so good caandidate for a green card. I, like you, get my \"news\" from the media. If you have something that refutes the story, I'll be glad to listen. I can't find a negative in this one ... and the statements (separate link from within the article) seem to bear it out ... as does the quote from this guy: quote: Vice Consul David Jendrisak, the Baghdad-based consular officer who denied Jasim's visa, said in a phone interview that the decision to deny Jasim a visa was made in consultation with the legal office of Consular Affairs in Washington, D.C., something that isn't done for most visas. He acknowledged that the decision was based on Jasim's theft of Uday Hussein's car, which he said was not deemed a \"political\" act for purposes of the visa denial. Based on government documents obtained by FOXNews.com, it appears that the Department of Homeland Security cleared Jasim for a visa, issuing him last May a \"notice of approval.\" Jendrisak, however, said that DHS had no authority to issue a visa now. The consular officer explained that Jasim would have to wait three years to apply for a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security. He refused to explain why Jasim would have to wait three years. Now ... maybe there is something else we don't know about ... but Jendrisak sure didn't provide it. This issue, I acknowledge, transcends two administrations ... the process began under Bush ... but has climaxed under Obama. Regardless of who one wishes to blame ... it is, IMHO, a bad decision.",

Are you suggesting that by not electing Senator McCain, we nonetheless got more of \"McSame\"? Qwert I know you have some experience with the federal government so I am sure you know it will take some time before the change will become apparent. I will buy off on your comment about past administrations, but what makes you so sure that the State Department is not acting correctly? Sound like something trumped up so the right has to be outraged over. Fact is the guy could be a not so good caandidate for a green card.", 
        "reply": " I, like you, get my \"news\" from the media. If you have something that refutes the story, I'll be glad to listen. I can't find a negative in this one ... and the statements (separate link from within the article) seem to bear it out ... as does the quote from this guy: quote: Vice Consul David Jendrisak, the Baghdad-based consular officer who denied Jasim's visa, said in a phone interview that the decision to deny Jasim a visa was made in consultation with the legal office of Consular Affairs in Washington, D.C., something that isn't done for most visas. He acknowledged that the decision was based on Jasim's theft of Uday Hussein's car, which he said was not deemed a \"political\" act for purposes of the visa denial. Based on government documents obtained by FOXNews.com, it appears that the Department of Homeland Security cleared Jasim for a visa, issuing him last May a \"notice of approval.\" Jendrisak, however, said that DHS had no authority to issue a visa now. The consular officer explained that Jasim would have to wait three years to apply for a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security. He refused to explain why Jasim would have to wait three years. Now ... maybe there is something else we don't know about ... but Jendrisak sure didn't provide it.
