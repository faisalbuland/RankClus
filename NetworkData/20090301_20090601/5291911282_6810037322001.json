That condition makes it a desirable port of entry for the scumbags that do this crime. Of course the Police around here are more concerned with \"who's driving around the city or walking through the neighborhoods\" rather than who's committing the real crime that effects the citizens and those who aren't yet and are in our country illegally. LEO's here are the micro-managers of the law enforcement world. I'm really surprised at the amount of crime that just goes un-investigated because their too damn lazy. A really sad part of this whole mess is that the criminals are probably being expedited by the local LEO's. I sympathize with your outrage but I think it's slightly misplaced. GO DUCKS!",

The Rose Garden and the Japanese Garden are older attractions created by another generation. When Vera came on the scene I saw the trouble coming. President of the Senate in the Oregon House. She fostered a lot of the recent liberal policy in this state. And the real kicker is she's from New York! Sam Adams the pedophile Mayor (Only the 2nd to hold this title while in office) will continue to laugh at the gullible morons he calls constituents and his conquest will write a book and make money. When did you leave Portland anyway? Wasn't Neil Goldsmith the other pediphile? 2004 was a busy year for me in Portland. I had a heart Attack on Feb 29, then followed that up with a stroke on July 28. Then my best friend who was living with me ( I was taking care of him)died of Emphysema so I had him cremated and his ashes buried up at Willamet National Cemetery. Then I sold me house and left town. Happiness was seeing Portland in the rear view mirror. Portland is a beautiful city with many super nice people and the view of Mt Hood is awesome, it's just too bad that there are so many liberals living there. What is the name of those bike riders that block traffic once a month? (critical mass or something like that?)",

Instead they check the criminals background and make a judgement based on whether the person had a good childhood rather than focusing on the crime that the person has committed.
