        "content": "For the long version, read this .... My Personal Credit Crisis By EDMUND L. ANDREWS Published: May 14, 2009 If there was anybody who should have avoided the mortgage catastrophe, it was I. As an economics reporter for The New York Times, I have been the paper\u2019s chief eyes and ears on the Federal Reserve for the past six years. I watched Alan Greenspan and his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, at close range. I wrote several early-warning articles in 2004 about the spike in go-go mortgages. Before that, I had a hand in covering the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Russia meltdown in 1998 and the dot-com collapse in 2000. I know a lot about the curveballs that the economy can throw at us. But in 2004, I joined millions of otherwise-sane Americans in what we now know was a catastrophic binge on overpriced real estate and reckless mortgages. Nobody duped or hypnotized me. Like so many others \u2014 borrowers, lenders and the Wall Street dealmakers behind them \u2014 I just thought I could beat the odds. We all had our reasons. The brokers and dealmakers were scoring huge commissions. Ordinary homebuyers were stretching to get into first houses, or bigger houses, or better neighborhoods. Some were greedy, some were desperate and some were deceived. As for me, I had two utterly compelling reasons for taking the plunge: the money was there, and I was in love. It was August 2004, just as the mortgage party was getting really good. I was 48 years old and eager to start a new chapter in my life with Patricia Barreiro, who was then my fianc\u00e9e. Patty was brainy, regal, sexy, fiery and eclectic. She was one of my closest friends when we were both students at an American high school in Argentina. Back then, we would talk together about politics and books at a coffee shop every day after school. We were not romantic in those days and went our separate ways after high school. But each of us would go through bruising two-decade-long marriages, and we felt that sweet spark of remembrance and renewal upon meeting again in middle age. After a one-year bicoastal courtship, Patty was about to move from her home in Los Angeles to Washington. We would need a home with enough space for her two youngest children, as well as for my own teenage boys on the weekends. I had assumed we would start by renting a house or an apartment, but it quickly became clear that it was almost easier to borrow a half-million dollars and buy something. Patty discovered a small but stately brick home in a leafy, kid-filled neighborhood in Silver Spring, Md. We sent in an offer of $460,000 and one day later got our answer: the sellers accepted. I felt both amazed and exhilarated, convinced that the stars had aligned for us. I loved the house as soon as I saw it. It was one block from a school and a park. My boys would be within a 15-minute drive, and it would be easy for them to come over and stay whenever they wanted. The only problem was money. Having separated from my wife of 21 years, who had physical custody of our sons, I was handing over $4,000 a month in alimony and child-support payments. That left me with take-home pay of $2,777, barely enough to make ends meet in a one-bedroom rental apartment. Patty had yet to even look for a job. At any other time in history, the idea of someone like me borrowing more than $400,000 would have seemed insane. But this was unlike any other time in history. My real estate agent gave me the number of Bob Andrews, a loan officer at American Home Mortgage Corporation. Bob wasn\u2019t related to me, and I had never heard of his company. \u201cBob can be very helpful,\u201d my agent explained. \u201cHe specializes in unusual situations.\u201d Bob returned my call right away. \u201cHow big a mortgage do you think you\u2019ll need?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy situation is a little complicated,\u201d I warned. I told him about my child support and alimony payments and said I was banking on Patty to earn enough money to keep us afloat. Bob cut me off. \u201cI specialize in challenges,\u201d he said confidently. As I quickly found out, American Home Mortgage had become one of the fastest-growing mortgage lenders in the country. One of its specialties was serving people just like me: borrowers with good credit scores who wanted to stretch their finances far beyond what our incomes could justify. In industry jargon, we were \u201cAlt-A\u201d customers, and we usually paid slightly higher rates for the privilege of concealing our financial weaknesses. I thought I knew a lot about go-go mortgages. I had already written several articles about the explosive growth of liar\u2019s loans, no-money-down loans, interest-only loans and other even more exotic mortgages. I had interviewed people with very modest incomes who had taken out big loans. Yet for all that, I was stunned at how much money people were willing to throw at me. Bob called back the next morning. \u201cYour credit scores are almost perfect,\u201d he said happily. \u201cBased on your income, you can qualify for a mortgage of about $500,000.\u201d What about my alimony and child-support obligations? No need to mention them. What would happen when they saw the automatic withholdings in my paycheck? No need to show them. If I wanted to buy a house, Bob figured, it was my job to decide whether I could afford it. His job was to make it happen. \u201cI am here to enable dreams,\u201d he explained to me long afterward. Bob\u2019s view was that if I\u2019d been unemployed for seven years and didn\u2019t have a dime to my name but I wanted a house, he wouldn\u2019t question my prudence. \u201cWho am I to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t do what you want to do? I am here to sell money and to help you do what you want to do. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your signature on the mortgage \u2014 not mine.\u201d You had to admire this muscular logic. My lenders weren\u2019t assuming that I was an angel. They were betting that a default would be more painful to me than to them. If I wanted to take a risk, for whatever reason, they were not going to second-guess me. What mattered more than anything, Bob explained, was a person\u2019s credit record. History seemed to show that the most important predictor of whether people defaulted on their mortgages was their \u201cFICO\u201d score (named after the Fair Isaac Corporation, which developed the main rating system). If you always paid your debts on time before, the theory went, you would probably keep paying on time in the future. Bob\u2019s original plan was to write two mortgages, one for 80 percent of the purchase price and a piggyback loan for 10 percent. I would kick in the final 10 percent, cashing out a chunk of New York Times stock \u2014 my last. If I had been a normal borrower, the whole deal would have sailed through at a low interest rate. My $120,000 base salary and my assets were easy to document. But given my actual income after alimony and child support, I couldn\u2019t possibly have qualified for a standard mortgage. Bob\u2019s plan was to write a \u201cstated-income loan,\u201d or \u201cliar\u2019s loan,\u201d so that I wouldn\u2019t have to give the game away by producing paychecks or tax returns. Unfortunately, Bob\u2019s plan hit a snag a few days later. \u201cEd, the underwriters say that your name is on another mortgage,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat means you\u2019re carrying too much debt.\u201d The mortgage was on my old house, which I had turned over to my ex-wife. As part of our separation agreement, she accepted full legal responsibility for making the payments. But the separation agreement also spelled out exactly how much I had to pay each month to my ex-wife. If we showed it to the underwriters, they would reject me. Bob didn\u2019t get flustered. If Plan A didn\u2019t work, he would simply move down another step on the ladder of credibility. Instead of \u201cstating\u201d my income without documenting it, I would take out a \u201cno ratio\u201d mortgage and not state my income at all. For the price of a slightly higher interest rate, American Home would verify my assets, but that was it. Because I wasn\u2019t stating my income, I couldn\u2019t have a debt-to-income ratio, and therefore, I couldn\u2019t have too much debt. I could have had four other mortgages, and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. American Home was practically begging me to take the money. Despite the obvious red flag of applying for a Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell loan, I wasn\u2019t paying that much for the money. The rate on my primary mortgage of $333,700 was a remarkably low 5.625 percent for the first five years, though my monthly payments would probably jump substantially after the fifth year. On top of that, I was paying a much higher rate of 8.5 percent on my \u201cpiggyback\u201d loan for $80,300. Even so, I would be paying slightly more than $2,500 a month for the first five years. It would get expensive eventually, but I could worry about that later. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Bob reassured me, saying what almost everybody else in real estate was saying at that moment. \u201cThe value of your house will be higher in five years. You\u2019ll be able to refinance.\u201d As I walked out of the settlement office with my loan papers, I couldn\u2019t shake the sense of having just done something bad . . . but also kind of cool. I had just come up with almost a half-million dollars, and I had barely lifted a finger. It had been so easy and fast. Almost fun. I couldn\u2019t help feeling like a high roller, a sophisticated player who could lay his hands on big money at a moment\u2019s notice. Despite my nagging anxiety about the gamble that Patty and I were taking, I had whipped through the pile of loan documents in less than 45 minutes. The icy slap of reality hit me two weeks after New Year\u2019s Day in January 2005. We had been living in our new house for five months. I walked out of The Times\u2019s Washington bureau, several blocks from the White House, and crossed Farragut Square to my bank. I had a bad feeling about what the A.T.M. would reveal about my balance, but I was shocked when I looked at the receipt: $196. We were broke. My stomach churning, I reached Patty on her cellphone as she was running errands. \u201cWe are out of money,\u201d I snapped, skipping over any warm-up chat. \u201cWhat do you mean, we\u2019re out of money?\u201d she asked in bewilderment. \u201cI mean, I just checked my bank account, and we are out of money,\u201d I repeated, my voice rising in panic. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy anything!\u201d My next paycheck would come in about a day or so, but that was entirely reserved for the February mortgage payment. We didn\u2019t have enough cash to cover more than a week\u2019s worth of groceries and gasoline. For the last few months we were living off the cash left over after I sold my Times stock and we bought the house. But now it was gone. \u201cHow the hell could we have run through so much money so quickly?\u201d I asked her accusingly. Patty wasn\u2019t sharing my shock. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she responded. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it when you get home.\u201d Patty had spent much of the two previous decades as a stay-at-home mother in Los Angeles. Her last full-time job, as an editor at a political research company, was back in the early 1980s. Not surprisingly, Patty\u2019s re-entry into the job market was bumpy. When Saks Fifth Avenue offered her a full-time job selling high-end clothing on commission \u2014 something she knew about and loved \u2014 she grabbed it. But with her take-home income averaging only about $2,400 a month, we didn\u2019t make enough to cover our bills because my take-home pay was going straight to the mortgage. We were spending way more than we were earning. In the euphoria of moving in together, we both succumbed to magical thinking about ourselves, as well as about money. My fantasy was that Patty would become an ambitious go-getter. \u201cThis can really be an exciting new chapter of your life,\u201d I kept telling her. Patty had a very different dream. \u201cI feel as if I am finally at home,\u201d she exclaimed as soon as we moved into the house. She could settle down and do the things she had always been best at: making a new home, nurturing her children and loving me. One way or another, she figured, we would earn enough money to make good on our glorious gamble. We had very different ideas about money. Patty spent little on herself, but she refused to scrimp on top-quality produce, Starbucks coffee, bottled juices, fresh cheeses and clothing for the children and for me. She regularly bought me new shirts and ties to replace the frayed and drab ones in my closet. She thought it wasn\u2019t worth agonizing over nickels and dimes. I was almost exactly the opposite. My answer to any money squeeze was to stop spending. I would skip lunch at work to save $7. If I arrived at the Metro just before the end of rush hour, I would wait for five minutes to save 50 cents on the fare. We were both building up grudges. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep second-guessing me,\u201d she told me angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s small-minded and petty, and it\u2019s not very attractive.\u201d I was beginning to wonder whether she had any clue about how money worked. We were lurching from paycheck to paycheck, one big home repair away from disaster. Meanwhile, neither of us was paying attention to how easy our bank had made it to build up debt. The key was the overdraft protection \u2014 more accurately described as \u201cbounced-check loans.\u201d Every time I overdrew my checking account by even a few dollars, the bank would tap my MasterCard for $100, helpfully deposit the cash in my account and charge me $10 for the privilege. Patty and I were now unwittingly tapping into our credit line at a terrifying pace: $5 overdrawn because of school supplies for Patty\u2019s daughter Emily \u2014 $100 from the MasterCard. Fifteen bucks over because of gasoline? Another $100 from the MasterCard. Groceries for $305? No problem! Uncle MasterCard would front us $400. Our debt spiraled up faster than I had ever dreamed possible. Chase Bank had cold-called me to offer a \u201cplatinum\u201d card with no interest charges for the first six months. I took them up on it and shifted $3,000 in debt from my old card onto the new Chase card. But instead of paying down the balance before the interest charges began, I let it balloon to $6,000. Chase had sent us blank checks that we could use to either pay bills or give ourselves cash advances. I dismissed them as a cheap trick to lure dimwits into borrowing more money. In March, I grabbed one of the checks and used it to pay down $1,000 on my more expensive credit card. I felt like a crack addict calling up my dealer. It was April 2006, and I had just reached Bob Andrews, our once and future mortgage broker, on his cellphone. I was surprised at how glad I was to hear his voice. In his own way, Bob knew more about my messy life than almost anybody else. He never seemed judgmental or condescending. Instead, he seemed to think that money trouble and failed marriages were natural parts of life, even for good people with decent jobs. I felt relieved to have the chance to unload my problems and ask for his advice. \u201cBob, we\u2019re dying over here,\u201d I wailed. \u201cI can\u2019t even explain how it happened, but we\u2019ve got these unbelievable credit-card bills, and the minimum payments add up to almost $1,100 a month. There\u2019s no way we can keep that up.\u201d I had months and months of credit-card bills spread across the dining-room table, and I quickly confessed the full horror of what they contained. We were approaching $50,000 in credit-card debt alone, and it was amazing how fast and how deeply we had dug ourselves in. It was even more amazing how long we had avoided the screaming evidence of a train wreck in the making. Patty had suddenly got the break that seemed to solve our problems. In November 2005, she was hired as a full-time editor at a nonprofit organization with a salary of $60,000 a year. The problem, I told Bob, was that things were so bad that even Patty\u2019s new job wouldn\u2019t be enough to rescue us. Chase was now charging us 13.99 percent on our platinum card, and the rate on our SunTrust card was up to 27 percent. Between humongous loan balances and high rates, we had hung ourselves with the rope they gave us. In the previous December alone, we charged $2,845 on the Chase card for Christmas gifts, food, gasoline, clothing and other expenses. The charges included almost $350 for groceries, $700 in clothes from J. Crew, $179 at GapKids and $700 for airplane tickets for two of Patty\u2019s children to visit their father in Los Angeles. Our balance climbed from $14,118 to $17,135, and in January 2006 we maxed out at our $19,000 credit limit. And there were other expenses on other cards: $1,200 in dental work for Patty\u2019s son Ben; $1,600 to rent a beach house the previous year for us and all the children. Granted, the beach house was an embarrassing mistake. But given that Patty had landed a solid job, it seemed like an indulgence we could work off later. I felt foolish, ashamed and angry as I confessed to Bob. Why had I been trying to live a lifestyle that I couldn\u2019t afford? Why had I tried to keep up the image of a conventional suburban family man, when nothing about my situation was conventional? How could I have glossed over the fact that we had been spending about $3,000 more than we were earning, month after month after month? How could a person who wrote about economics for a living fall into the kind of credit-card trap that consumer groups had warned about for years? \u201cMy inclination is to just raid my 401(k) account to pay off the cards,\u201d I told Bob. \u201cI know we\u2019d be paying huge taxes and penalties for withdrawing money before retirement, but it\u2019s not as bad as paying all that interest to the banks.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Bob interrupted fiercely. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that. You\u2019ll be paying a basic tax rate of 28 percent, and they\u2019ll hit you with another 10 percent penalty. You\u2019d be giving up 40 percent in taxes. There\u2019s got to be a better way.\u201d I gave Bob permission to pull a credit report on us, and by the next day, he had come up with a scheme that was either wickedly smart or proof that the big-money people had gone mad. Or both. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is a two-step plan,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe bad news is that your credit scores are down, so we can\u2019t just do a simple refinance. But the good news is that you\u2019ve owned your house for a year and a half, and it\u2019s gone up in value. So you can borrow against the equity. So in the first step of the plan, we\u2019re going to get you a really ugly mortgage that is big enough to pay off all your credit cards.\u201d \u201cO.K., I\u2019m with you so far,\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cNow, because this mortgage is really ugly, your monthly payments will jump to about $3,700. But don\u2019t worry about it, because you\u2019re only going to stay in it for about three months. Once we pay off your credit cards, your credit scores will go up and we can get you a cheaper loan.\u201d The way Bob figured it, my monthly payment would be down to about $3,200 by the fall. The new mortgage would be nearly $700 more than my current mortgage because it would include all my credit-card debt, but it would be at least $500 a month less than the combined total of what I was paying on everything right then. And mortgage interest, unlike interest on credit-card debt, is entirely tax-deductible. The whole plan worked exactly as Bob had predicted. Within a few weeks, an appraiser valued our house at $505,000, almost 10 percent above the original purchase price two years earlier. On June 12, Patty and I signed a new mortgage for $472,000 with Fremont Investment and Loan in Santa Monica, Calif. Fremont gave us a classic subprime loan. Our monthly payment jumped to $3,700 from $2,500. If we kept the mortgage for two years, the interest rate would jump as high as 11.5 percent, and the monthly payments would ratchet up to as high as $4,500. The paperwork was so confusing that I was never exactly sure who was paying what. I hazily understood that I was paying most of the fees, one way or another, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how, and I couldn\u2019t see any better alternatives. After it was all over, I figured we had paid about $5,800 in fees to Bob\u2019s mortgage company and the settlement company, on top of the sales commission that came out in higher interest rates every month. But Patty and I paid off our credit cards, and my credit scores jumped. In October 2006, Bob refinanced us once again, and our payments dropped just as he had predicted. We were still loaded with debt, but we weren\u2019t paying 27 percent interest rates on our credit cards. Patty was earning a solid salary, and I was earning extra money working overtime at The Times. If we were careful, we could meet our monthly expenses, chip away at our debt and even go out to dinner once in a while. Our brief interlude of optimism and peace ended on Oct. 10, 2006, when Patty lost her job. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said bravely. \u201cThis will not be like the first time I was looking for a job. I\u2019ve learned so much since then, and I am going to find another job quickly.\u201d In the meantime, she said, she could collect unemployment for six months. She would also cash out her retirement account, which had about $7,000 in it. By any measure, the loss of Patty\u2019s job was a financial catastrophe. We hadn\u2019t yet gone more than 30 days delinquent on the mortgage, thanks, in part, to $15,000 I had borrowed shamefacedly from my mother after Patty stopped working. But we were behind on everything else. Bill collectors were calling six days a week, starting promptly at 8 a.m. \u201cTelemarketers,\u201d I would mumble when my son Matthew asked why we got so many robocalls from 800 numbers. Our stately little house looked increasingly trashy: peeling paint and broken screens on the front windows, crumbling concrete on the front stoop, a lawn that was mostly crabgrass. The furniture that Patty salvaged from her first marriage was falling apart. The cotton slipcovers on the sofa and armchair were in shreds. The frosted-crystal shade on a beloved Italian floor lamp was cracked. The dog had gnawed the leg on her Biedermeier chair. The panic attack hit me around 2 a.m. on Patty\u2019s birthday. It was Oct. 17, 2007, and I was lying in bed obsessing over bills that couldn\u2019t be postponed and the money we didn\u2019t have to pay them. Like many of my predawn fear cascades, this one had its start with a specific unpaid bill: $240 in traffic tickets \u2014 $140 for speeding, $50 each for expired tags and inspection. The fines would double if we didn\u2019t pay them in less than a week. The tickets had uncorked the bottle on all the other \u201cmust pays\u201d: the $400 electric bill with the cutoff date printed in red; the $220 cable/telephone/Internet bill for the past two months; the MasterCard and American Express bills \u2014 at least one of which had to be brought current or I wouldn\u2019t even be able to travel for work. And of course, there was the $3,271 mortgage payment. My panic circuitry was in fine form, connecting small debts to big ones, short-term problems to the bottomless abyss, private calamity to public shame. Once Patty was asleep and I was alone in the dark, the bottled-up fear reached the surface. I tossed from side to side, trying to figure out at least a triage plan for our bills. I was too fidgety to lie still in bed, but I was in no mood to actually sit down with the bills themselves. I climbed out of bed for a moment, then jumped back in. I couldn\u2019t decide if I would rather feel confined or all alone. Patty woke up, irritated by all my movement and my occasional moans of despair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d I answered. \u201cI\u2019m panicking about money, because I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to pay all the bills that need to be paid right now.\u201d I wanted her to take me in her arms and reassure me that everything would be O.K. But that wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it right now,\u201d she answered sleepily. \u201cIf this keeps on, we\u2019re going to lose the house,\u201d I persisted, sounding less panicked than petulant. If Patty wouldn\u2019t give me comfort, then I wanted her to suffer alongside me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to make it. We can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d Patty had begged me to grant her a birthday reprieve from my nagging and kvetching over money issues. What I saw as an uncontrollable moment of panic, she saw as another deliberate attempt to browbeat her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are doing this to me on my birthday,\u201d she hissed in fury. \u201cAll I asked for was one day of peace \u2014 one day when you weren\u2019t beating me over the head. And here it is, not even daylight yet, and you\u2019re waking me up to berate me about money.\u201d \u201cSon of a *****, what did I do to you?\u201d I asked, punching my pillow in the dark. \u201cDo you think I enjoy having a panic attack? I can\u2019t help what I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m just scared out of my mind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Patty snapped, getting out of bed and pulling on her robe. \u201cI\u2019m not going to listen to any more of this. I\u2019m going to sleep downstairs.\u201d In the morning, she let me have it. \u201cYou lied to me,\u201d she told me as I got coffee. \u201cYou said that what I saw on the outside was pretty much what you were. But you\u2019re completely different. If I had known what you were really like, I would never have come out here.\u201d Patty and I were hurtling toward bottom. We had been under so much strain for so long that we were often at each other\u2019s throats, jeopardizing the love that brought us together in the first place. In November, four years after buying the house, we finally crossed our personal Rubicon and fell 30 days behind on our mortgage. \u201cThe last thing Chase wants is to foreclose on your home,\u201d JPMorgan Chase wrote us. It assured us that it wanted to \u201chelp\u201d and was willing to evaluate us for a number of \u201calternatives.\u201d If we didn\u2019t \u201cresolve\u201d our payment delinquency, it politely warned, \u201cyou will lose your home.\u201d *** I took a certain pride that I outlasted two of my three mortgage lenders. American Home, my original lender, collapsed overnight when the financial markets first froze up in August 2007. Fremont, my second lender, was forced out of the mortgage business by federal regulators. That left me with JPMorgan Chase, one of the few big banks smart enough to sell off most of the subprime loans it financed. It still serviced my loan, but it wasn\u2019t on the hook if I defaulted. By the time that Patty and I fell behind, the rest of the world was falling apart so fast that Chase barely had time for us. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were gone. American International Group, one of the world\u2019s biggest insurance conglomerates, received the biggest taxpayer-financed bailout in history. Citigroup was a zombie bank. All of them were brought down by the same mortgage madness that infected me. When I first called Chase in October, a representative named Sarah said I didn\u2019t qualify for a loan modification because I wasn\u2019t yet 90 days past due. The only \u201cloan modification\u201d she could offer me was a \u201crepayment plan\u201d under which I paid $400 more per month for six months until I was current again. \u201cIt sounds as if I would be better off waiting to fall 90 days behind,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll wait for that.\u201d It took a while, but Patty and I found we could get past blaming each other. We had seen each other\u2019s worst sides, but we were still together, and that helped us to get closer. We started listening to each other. Patty began to find her way in the work world, and I was learning that I didn\u2019t have all the answers. And we saw how our children were thriving. My three sons transferred to schools in our neighborhood and made scores of friends. Emily, Patty\u2019s daughter, was a sparkling 10-year-old who loved her home and her school as well as all her brothers. Even if we lost the house, we had gained in other ways. I called Chase back in January, when I was 90 days past due. Another representative told me that I would automatically be evaluated for a loan modification. \u201cYou should just wait until you hear from one of our negotiators,\u201d he told me politely. Another two months passed without anyone calling, so I tried again in late March. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but our analysts have been backed up,\u201d yet another Chase rep told me, even more politely than the previous one. She said each analyst had about 500 distressed borrowers to deal with, and it had been taking about five weeks for customers to get a direct response. The delays seemed to be getting longer. I was actually beginning to feel sorry for Chase. It seemed to be so flooded with defaulting borrowers that it didn\u2019t have time to foreclose on my house. Eight months after my last payment to the bank, I am still waiting for the ax to fall. nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17foreclosure-t.html?pagewanted=6&_r=1",

        "reply": "For the long version, read this .... My Personal Credit Crisis By EDMUND L. ANDREWS Published: May 14, 2009 If there was anybody who should have avoided the mortgage catastrophe, it was I. As an economics reporter for The New York Times, I have been the paper\u2019s chief eyes and ears on the Federal Reserve for the past six years. I watched Alan Greenspan and his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, at close range. I wrote several early-warning articles in 2004 about the spike in go-go mortgages. Before that, I had a hand in covering the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Russia meltdown in 1998 and the dot-com collapse in 2000. I know a lot about the curveballs that the economy can throw at us. But in 2004, I joined millions of otherwise-sane Americans in what we now know was a catastrophic binge on overpriced real estate and reckless mortgages. Nobody duped or hypnotized me. Like so many others \u2014 borrowers, lenders and the Wall Street dealmakers behind them \u2014 I just thought I could beat the odds. We all had our reasons. The brokers and dealmakers were scoring huge commissions. Ordinary homebuyers were stretching to get into first houses, or bigger houses, or better neighborhoods. Some were greedy, some were desperate and some were deceived. As for me, I had two utterly compelling reasons for taking the plunge: the money was there, and I was in love. It was August 2004, just as the mortgage party was getting really good. I was 48 years old and eager to start a new chapter in my life with Patricia Barreiro, who was then my fianc\u00e9e. Patty was brainy, regal, sexy, fiery and eclectic. She was one of my closest friends when we were both students at an American high school in Argentina. Back then, we would talk together about politics and books at a coffee shop every day after school. We were not romantic in those days and went our separate ways after high school. But each of us would go through bruising two-decade-long marriages, and we felt that sweet spark of remembrance and renewal upon meeting again in middle age. After a one-year bicoastal courtship, Patty was about to move from her home in Los Angeles to Washington. We would need a home with enough space for her two youngest children, as well as for my own teenage boys on the weekends. I had assumed we would start by renting a house or an apartment, but it quickly became clear that it was almost easier to borrow a half-million dollars and buy something. Patty discovered a small but stately brick home in a leafy, kid-filled neighborhood in Silver Spring, Md. We sent in an offer of $460,000 and one day later got our answer: the sellers accepted. I felt both amazed and exhilarated, convinced that the stars had aligned for us. I loved the house as soon as I saw it. It was one block from a school and a park. My boys would be within a 15-minute drive, and it would be easy for them to come over and stay whenever they wanted. The only problem was money. Having separated from my wife of 21 years, who had physical custody of our sons, I was handing over $4,000 a month in alimony and child-support payments. That left me with take-home pay of $2,777, barely enough to make ends meet in a one-bedroom rental apartment. Patty had yet to even look for a job. At any other time in history, the idea of someone like me borrowing more than $400,000 would have seemed insane. But this was unlike any other time in history. My real estate agent gave me the number of Bob Andrews, a loan officer at American Home Mortgage Corporation. Bob wasn\u2019t related to me, and I had never heard of his company. \u201cBob can be very helpful,\u201d my agent explained. \u201cHe specializes in unusual situations.\u201d Bob returned my call right away. \u201cHow big a mortgage do you think you\u2019ll need?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy situation is a little complicated,\u201d I warned. I told him about my child support and alimony payments and said I was banking on Patty to earn enough money to keep us afloat. Bob cut me off. \u201cI specialize in challenges,\u201d he said confidently. As I quickly found out, American Home Mortgage had become one of the fastest-growing mortgage lenders in the country. One of its specialties was serving people just like me: borrowers with good credit scores who wanted to stretch their finances far beyond what our incomes could justify. In industry jargon, we were \u201cAlt-A\u201d customers, and we usually paid slightly higher rates for the privilege of concealing our financial weaknesses. I thought I knew a lot about go-go mortgages. I had already written several articles about the explosive growth of liar\u2019s loans, no-money-down loans, interest-only loans and other even more exotic mortgages. I had interviewed people with very modest incomes who had taken out big loans. Yet for all that, I was stunned at how much money people were willing to throw at me. Bob called back the next morning. \u201cYour credit scores are almost perfect,\u201d he said happily. \u201cBased on your income, you can qualify for a mortgage of about $500,000.\u201d What about my alimony and child-support obligations? No need to mention them. What would happen when they saw the automatic withholdings in my paycheck? No need to show them. If I wanted to buy a house, Bob figured, it was my job to decide whether I could afford it. His job was to make it happen. \u201cI am here to enable dreams,\u201d he explained to me long afterward. Bob\u2019s view was that if I\u2019d been unemployed for seven years and didn\u2019t have a dime to my name but I wanted a house, he wouldn\u2019t question my prudence. \u201cWho am I to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t do what you want to do? I am here to sell money and to help you do what you want to do. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your signature on the mortgage \u2014 not mine.\u201d You had to admire this muscular logic. My lenders weren\u2019t assuming that I was an angel. They were betting that a default would be more painful to me than to them. If I wanted to take a risk, for whatever reason, they were not going to second-guess me. What mattered more than anything, Bob explained, was a person\u2019s credit record. History seemed to show that the most important predictor of whether people defaulted on their mortgages was their \u201cFICO\u201d score (named after the Fair Isaac Corporation, which developed the main rating system). If you always paid your debts on time before, the theory went, you would probably keep paying on time in the future. Bob\u2019s original plan was to write two mortgages, one for 80 percent of the purchase price and a piggyback loan for 10 percent. I would kick in the final 10 percent, cashing out a chunk of New York Times stock \u2014 my last. If I had been a normal borrower, the whole deal would have sailed through at a low interest rate. My $120,000 base salary and my assets were easy to document. But given my actual income after alimony and child support, I couldn\u2019t possibly have qualified for a standard mortgage. Bob\u2019s plan was to write a \u201cstated-income loan,\u201d or \u201cliar\u2019s loan,\u201d so that I wouldn\u2019t have to give the game away by producing paychecks or tax returns. Unfortunately, Bob\u2019s plan hit a snag a few days later. \u201cEd, the underwriters say that your name is on another mortgage,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat means you\u2019re carrying too much debt.\u201d The mortgage was on my old house, which I had turned over to my ex-wife. As part of our separation agreement, she accepted full legal responsibility for making the payments. But the separation agreement also spelled out exactly how much I had to pay each month to my ex-wife. If we showed it to the underwriters, they would reject me. Bob didn\u2019t get flustered. If Plan A didn\u2019t work, he would simply move down another step on the ladder of credibility. Instead of \u201cstating\u201d my income without documenting it, I would take out a \u201cno ratio\u201d mortgage and not state my income at all. For the price of a slightly higher interest rate, American Home would verify my assets, but that was it. Because I wasn\u2019t stating my income, I couldn\u2019t have a debt-to-income ratio, and therefore, I couldn\u2019t have too much debt. I could have had four other mortgages, and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. American Home was practically begging me to take the money. Despite the obvious red flag of applying for a Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell loan, I wasn\u2019t paying that much for the money. The rate on my primary mortgage of $333,700 was a remarkably low 5.625 percent for the first five years, though my monthly payments would probably jump substantially after the fifth year. On top of that, I was paying a much higher rate of 8.5 percent on my \u201cpiggyback\u201d loan for $80,300. Even so, I would be paying slightly more than $2,500 a month for the first five years. It would get expensive eventually, but I could worry about that later. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Bob reassured me, saying what almost everybody else in real estate was saying at that moment. \u201cThe value of your house will be higher in five years. You\u2019ll be able to refinance.\u201d As I walked out of the settlement office with my loan papers, I couldn\u2019t shake the sense of having just done something bad . . . but also kind of cool. I had just come up with almost a half-million dollars, and I had barely lifted a finger. It had been so easy and fast. Almost fun. I couldn\u2019t help feeling like a high roller, a sophisticated player who could lay his hands on big money at a moment\u2019s notice. Despite my nagging anxiety about the gamble that Patty and I were taking, I had whipped through the pile of loan documents in less than 45 minutes. The icy slap of reality hit me two weeks after New Year\u2019s Day in January 2005. We had been living in our new house for five months. I walked out of The Times\u2019s Washington bureau, several blocks from the White House, and crossed Farragut Square to my bank. I had a bad feeling about what the A.T.M. would reveal about my balance, but I was shocked when I looked at the receipt: $196. We were broke. My stomach churning, I reached Patty on her cellphone as she was running errands. \u201cWe are out of money,\u201d I snapped, skipping over any warm-up chat. \u201cWhat do you mean, we\u2019re out of money?\u201d she asked in bewilderment. \u201cI mean, I just checked my bank account, and we are out of money,\u201d I repeated, my voice rising in panic. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy anything!\u201d My next paycheck would come in about a day or so, but that was entirely reserved for the February mortgage payment. We didn\u2019t have enough cash to cover more than a week\u2019s worth of groceries and gasoline. For the last few months we were living off the cash left over after I sold my Times stock and we bought the house. But now it was gone. \u201cHow the hell could we have run through so much money so quickly?\u201d I asked her accusingly. Patty wasn\u2019t sharing my shock. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she responded. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it when you get home.\u201d Patty had spent much of the two previous decades as a stay-at-home mother in Los Angeles. Her last full-time job, as an editor at a political research company, was back in the early 1980s. Not surprisingly, Patty\u2019s re-entry into the job market was bumpy. When Saks Fifth Avenue offered her a full-time job selling high-end clothing on commission \u2014 something she knew about and loved \u2014 she grabbed it. But with her take-home income averaging only about $2,400 a month, we didn\u2019t make enough to cover our bills because my take-home pay was going straight to the mortgage. We were spending way more than we were earning. In the euphoria of moving in together, we both succumbed to magical thinking about ourselves, as well as about money. My fantasy was that Patty would become an ambitious go-getter. \u201cThis can really be an exciting new chapter of your life,\u201d I kept telling her. Patty had a very different dream. \u201cI feel as if I am finally at home,\u201d she exclaimed as soon as we moved into the house. She could settle down and do the things she had always been best at: making a new home, nurturing her children and loving me. One way or another, she figured, we would earn enough money to make good on our glorious gamble. We had very different ideas about money. Patty spent little on herself, but she refused to scrimp on top-quality produce, Starbucks coffee, bottled juices, fresh cheeses and clothing for the children and for me. She regularly bought me new shirts and ties to replace the frayed and drab ones in my closet. She thought it wasn\u2019t worth agonizing over nickels and dimes. I was almost exactly the opposite. My answer to any money squeeze was to stop spending. I would skip lunch at work to save $7. If I arrived at the Metro just before the end of rush hour, I would wait for five minutes to save 50 cents on the fare. We were both building up grudges. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep second-guessing me,\u201d she told me angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s small-minded and petty, and it\u2019s not very attractive.\u201d I was beginning to wonder whether she had any clue about how money worked. We were lurching from paycheck to paycheck, one big home repair away from disaster. Meanwhile, neither of us was paying attention to how easy our bank had made it to build up debt. The key was the overdraft protection \u2014 more accurately described as \u201cbounced-check loans.\u201d Every time I overdrew my checking account by even a few dollars, the bank would tap my MasterCard for $100, helpfully deposit the cash in my account and charge me $10 for the privilege. Patty and I were now unwittingly tapping into our credit line at a terrifying pace: $5 overdrawn because of school supplies for Patty\u2019s daughter Emily \u2014 $100 from the MasterCard. Fifteen bucks over because of gasoline? Another $100 from the MasterCard. Groceries for $305? No problem! Uncle MasterCard would front us $400. Our debt spiraled up faster than I had ever dreamed possible. Chase Bank had cold-called me to offer a \u201cplatinum\u201d card with no interest charges for the first six months. I took them up on it and shifted $3,000 in debt from my old card onto the new Chase card. But instead of paying down the balance before the interest charges began, I let it balloon to $6,000. Chase had sent us blank checks that we could use to either pay bills or give ourselves cash advances. I dismissed them as a cheap trick to lure dimwits into borrowing more money. In March, I grabbed one of the checks and used it to pay down $1,000 on my more expensive credit card. I felt like a crack addict calling up my dealer. It was April 2006, and I had just reached Bob Andrews, our once and future mortgage broker, on his cellphone. I was surprised at how glad I was to hear his voice. In his own way, Bob knew more about my messy life than almost anybody else. He never seemed judgmental or condescending. Instead, he seemed to think that money trouble and failed marriages were natural parts of life, even for good people with decent jobs. I felt relieved to have the chance to unload my problems and ask for his advice. \u201cBob, we\u2019re dying over here,\u201d I wailed. \u201cI can\u2019t even explain how it happened, but we\u2019ve got these unbelievable credit-card bills, and the minimum payments add up to almost $1,100 a month. There\u2019s no way we can keep that up.\u201d I had months and months of credit-card bills spread across the dining-room table, and I quickly confessed the full horror of what they contained. We were approaching $50,000 in credit-card debt alone, and it was amazing how fast and how deeply we had dug ourselves in. It was even more amazing how long we had avoided the screaming evidence of a train wreck in the making. Patty had suddenly got the break that seemed to solve our problems. In November 2005, she was hired as a full-time editor at a nonprofit organization with a salary of $60,000 a year. The problem, I told Bob, was that things were so bad that even Patty\u2019s new job wouldn\u2019t be enough to rescue us. Chase was now charging us 13.99 percent on our platinum card, and the rate on our SunTrust card was up to 27 percent. Between humongous loan balances and high rates, we had hung ourselves with the rope they gave us. In the previous December alone, we charged $2,845 on the Chase card for Christmas gifts, food, gasoline, clothing and other expenses. The charges included almost $350 for groceries, $700 in clothes from J. Crew, $179 at GapKids and $700 for airplane tickets for two of Patty\u2019s children to visit their father in Los Angeles. Our balance climbed from $14,118 to $17,135, and in January 2006 we maxed out at our $19,000 credit limit. And there were other expenses on other cards: $1,200 in dental work for Patty\u2019s son Ben; $1,600 to rent a beach house the previous year for us and all the children. Granted, the beach house was an embarrassing mistake. But given that Patty had landed a solid job, it seemed like an indulgence we could work off later. I felt foolish, ashamed and angry as I confessed to Bob. Why had I been trying to live a lifestyle that I couldn\u2019t afford? Why had I tried to keep up the image of a conventional suburban family man, when nothing about my situation was conventional? How could I have glossed over the fact that we had been spending about $3,000 more than we were earning, month after month after month? How could a person who wrote about economics for a living fall into the kind of credit-card trap that consumer groups had warned about for years? \u201cMy inclination is to just raid my 401(k) account to pay off the cards,\u201d I told Bob. \u201cI know we\u2019d be paying huge taxes and penalties for withdrawing money before retirement, but it\u2019s not as bad as paying all that interest to the banks.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Bob interrupted fiercely. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that. You\u2019ll be paying a basic tax rate of 28 percent, and they\u2019ll hit you with another 10 percent penalty. You\u2019d be giving up 40 percent in taxes. There\u2019s got to be a better way.\u201d I gave Bob permission to pull a credit report on us, and by the next day, he had come up with a scheme that was either wickedly smart or proof that the big-money people had gone mad. Or both. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is a two-step plan,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe bad news is that your credit scores are down, so we can\u2019t just do a simple refinance. But the good news is that you\u2019ve owned your house for a year and a half, and it\u2019s gone up in value. So you can borrow against the equity. So in the first step of the plan, we\u2019re going to get you a really ugly mortgage that is big enough to pay off all your credit cards.\u201d \u201cO.K., I\u2019m with you so far,\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cNow, because this mortgage is really ugly, your monthly payments will jump to about $3,700. But don\u2019t worry about it, because you\u2019re only going to stay in it for about three months. Once we pay off your credit cards, your credit scores will go up and we can get you a cheaper loan.\u201d The way Bob figured it, my monthly payment would be down to about $3,200 by the fall. The new mortgage would be nearly $700 more than my current mortgage because it would include all my credit-card debt, but it would be at least $500 a month less than the combined total of what I was paying on everything right then. And mortgage interest, unlike interest on credit-card debt, is entirely tax-deductible. The whole plan worked exactly as Bob had predicted. Within a few weeks, an appraiser valued our house at $505,000, almost 10 percent above the original purchase price two years earlier. On June 12, Patty and I signed a new mortgage for $472,000 with Fremont Investment and Loan in Santa Monica, Calif. Fremont gave us a classic subprime loan. Our monthly payment jumped to $3,700 from $2,500. If we kept the mortgage for two years, the interest rate would jump as high as 11.5 percent, and the monthly payments would ratchet up to as high as $4,500. The paperwork was so confusing that I was never exactly sure who was paying what. I hazily understood that I was paying most of the fees, one way or another, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how, and I couldn\u2019t see any better alternatives. After it was all over, I figured we had paid about $5,800 in fees to Bob\u2019s mortgage company and the settlement company, on top of the sales commission that came out in higher interest rates every month. But Patty and I paid off our credit cards, and my credit scores jumped. In October 2006, Bob refinanced us once again, and our payments dropped just as he had predicted. We were still loaded with debt, but we weren\u2019t paying 27 percent interest rates on our credit cards. Patty was earning a solid salary, and I was earning extra money working overtime at The Times. If we were careful, we could meet our monthly expenses, chip away at our debt and even go out to dinner once in a while. Our brief interlude of optimism and peace ended on Oct. 10, 2006, when Patty lost her job. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said bravely. \u201cThis will not be like the first time I was looking for a job. I\u2019ve learned so much since then, and I am going to find another job quickly.\u201d In the meantime, she said, she could collect unemployment for six months. She would also cash out her retirement account, which had about $7,000 in it. By any measure, the loss of Patty\u2019s job was a financial catastrophe. We hadn\u2019t yet gone more than 30 days delinquent on the mortgage, thanks, in part, to $15,000 I had borrowed shamefacedly from my mother after Patty stopped working. But we were behind on everything else. Bill collectors were calling six days a week, starting promptly at 8 a.m. \u201cTelemarketers,\u201d I would mumble when my son Matthew asked why we got so many robocalls from 800 numbers. Our stately little house looked increasingly trashy: peeling paint and broken screens on the front windows, crumbling concrete on the front stoop, a lawn that was mostly crabgrass. The furniture that Patty salvaged from her first marriage was falling apart. The cotton slipcovers on the sofa and armchair were in shreds. The frosted-crystal shade on a beloved Italian floor lamp was cracked. The dog had gnawed the leg on her Biedermeier chair. The panic attack hit me around 2 a.m. on Patty\u2019s birthday. It was Oct. 17, 2007, and I was lying in bed obsessing over bills that couldn\u2019t be postponed and the money we didn\u2019t have to pay them. Like many of my predawn fear cascades, this one had its start with a specific unpaid bill: $240 in traffic tickets \u2014 $140 for speeding, $50 each for expired tags and inspection. The fines would double if we didn\u2019t pay them in less than a week. The tickets had uncorked the bottle on all the other \u201cmust pays\u201d: the $400 electric bill with the cutoff date printed in red; the $220 cable/telephone/Internet bill for the past two months; the MasterCard and American Express bills \u2014 at least one of which had to be brought current or I wouldn\u2019t even be able to travel for work. And of course, there was the $3,271 mortgage payment. My panic circuitry was in fine form, connecting small debts to big ones, short-term problems to the bottomless abyss, private calamity to public shame. Once Patty was asleep and I was alone in the dark, the bottled-up fear reached the surface. I tossed from side to side, trying to figure out at least a triage plan for our bills. I was too fidgety to lie still in bed, but I was in no mood to actually sit down with the bills themselves. I climbed out of bed for a moment, then jumped back in. I couldn\u2019t decide if I would rather feel confined or all alone. Patty woke up, irritated by all my movement and my occasional moans of despair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d I answered. \u201cI\u2019m panicking about money, because I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to pay all the bills that need to be paid right now.\u201d I wanted her to take me in her arms and reassure me that everything would be O.K. But that wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it right now,\u201d she answered sleepily. \u201cIf this keeps on, we\u2019re going to lose the house,\u201d I persisted, sounding less panicked than petulant. If Patty wouldn\u2019t give me comfort, then I wanted her to suffer alongside me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to make it. We can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d Patty had begged me to grant her a birthday reprieve from my nagging and kvetching over money issues. What I saw as an uncontrollable moment of panic, she saw as another deliberate attempt to browbeat her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are doing this to me on my birthday,\u201d she hissed in fury. \u201cAll I asked for was one day of peace \u2014 one day when you weren\u2019t beating me over the head. And here it is, not even daylight yet, and you\u2019re waking me up to berate me about money.\u201d \u201cSon of a *****, what did I do to you?\u201d I asked, punching my pillow in the dark. \u201cDo you think I enjoy having a panic attack? I can\u2019t help what I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m just scared out of my mind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Patty snapped, getting out of bed and pulling on her robe. \u201cI\u2019m not going to listen to any more of this. I\u2019m going to sleep downstairs.\u201d In the morning, she let me have it. \u201cYou lied to me,\u201d she told me as I got coffee. \u201cYou said that what I saw on the outside was pretty much what you were. But you\u2019re completely different. If I had known what you were really like, I would never have come out here.\u201d Patty and I were hurtling toward bottom. We had been under so much strain for so long that we were often at each other\u2019s throats, jeopardizing the love that brought us together in the first place. In November, four years after buying the house, we finally crossed our personal Rubicon and fell 30 days behind on our mortgage. \u201cThe last thing Chase wants is to foreclose on your home,\u201d JPMorgan Chase wrote us. It assured us that it wanted to \u201chelp\u201d and was willing to evaluate us for a number of \u201calternatives.\u201d If we didn\u2019t \u201cresolve\u201d our payment delinquency, it politely warned, \u201cyou will lose your home.\u201d *** I took a certain pride that I outlasted two of my three mortgage lenders. American Home, my original lender, collapsed overnight when the financial markets first froze up in August 2007. Fremont, my second lender, was forced out of the mortgage business by federal regulators. That left me with JPMorgan Chase, one of the few big banks smart enough to sell off most of the subprime loans it financed. It still serviced my loan, but it wasn\u2019t on the hook if I defaulted. By the time that Patty and I fell behind, the rest of the world was falling apart so fast that Chase barely had time for us. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were gone. American International Group, one of the world\u2019s biggest insurance conglomerates, received the biggest taxpayer-financed bailout in history. Citigroup was a zombie bank. All of them were brought down by the same mortgage madness that infected me. When I first called Chase in October, a representative named Sarah said I didn\u2019t qualify for a loan modification because I wasn\u2019t yet 90 days past due. The only \u201cloan modification\u201d she could offer me was a \u201crepayment plan\u201d under which I paid $400 more per month for six months until I was current again. \u201cIt sounds as if I would be better off waiting to fall 90 days behind,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll wait for that.\u201d It took a while, but Patty and I found we could get past blaming each other. We had seen each other\u2019s worst sides, but we were still together, and that helped us to get closer. We started listening to each other. Patty began to find her way in the work world, and I was learning that I didn\u2019t have all the answers. And we saw how our children were thriving. My three sons transferred to schools in our neighborhood and made scores of friends. Emily, Patty\u2019s daughter, was a sparkling 10-year-old who loved her home and her school as well as all her brothers. Even if we lost the house, we had gained in other ways. I called Chase back in January, when I was 90 days past due. Another representative told me that I would automatically be evaluated for a loan modification. \u201cYou should just wait until you hear from one of our negotiators,\u201d he told me politely. Another two months passed without anyone calling, so I tried again in late March. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but our analysts have been backed up,\u201d yet another Chase rep told me, even more politely than the previous one. She said each analyst had about 500 distressed borrowers to deal with, and it had been taking about five weeks for customers to get a direct response. The delays seemed to be getting longer. I was actually beginning to feel sorry for Chase. It seemed to be so flooded with defaulting borrowers that it didn\u2019t have time to foreclose on my house. Eight months after my last payment to the bank, I am still waiting for the ax to fall. nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17foreclosure-t.html?pagewanted=6&_r=1",
