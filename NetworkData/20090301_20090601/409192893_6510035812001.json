I wonder how long it will be before someone comes out and makes the point that if the animal is in heat that thats means the creature is giving consent? Im sure some nutt job lawyer will come out for the cause, and soon well have people coming out of the ...ehh closet ehh... shed...ehh barn, saying they sleep with animals. warnign the link below and the article will tuen your stomach JUNEAU, Alaska \u2014 It's a subject that can cause nervous snickering, a little uneasiness and even a few bad jokes. But many in the southeast Alaska community of Klawock, population 800, weren't laughing last April after a 26-year-old registered sex offender was accused of molesting a local family's pet dog. The man was spotted by a local woman coaxing the Labrador retriever into the woods near a ball field. There he allegedly tied it to a tree, taped its muzzle shut with duct tape and had sex with it, witnesses told police at the time. The man had been twice convicted of raping a young boy and more recently had served probation for assault after lunging at a child. While the incident with the dog was reported to the police, Klawock Mayor Don Marvin said nothing happened for two days while fearful parents escorted their children home from school. \"When this incident happened, we had a community that was scared,\" Marvin said. Because Alaska has no law against such an attack, Ketchikan District Attorney James Scott eventually charged the man with two counts of criminal mischief, which was later changed to a Just to be fair, the same news story discussed similar problems (goat rape) in the FL panhandle. As in Alaska, as well as other states, there are no laws prohibiting such behavior. This was on the local news last night. It is sick and disgusting, IMO and we don't have any laws here for it. In case some of you aren't aware, some real sicko's are hiding out in the bush and some of them are guilty of this and much worse. I have had the unfortunate experience of knowing someone who is guilty of this sadistic action and is proud of it. I am all for this becoming outlawed. It's about damn time.",
