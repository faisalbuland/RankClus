It's perfectly reasonable to want the same rights in regards to taxation as every other married couple. Why, as a married person, should I be forced to pay the higher \"single\" tax rate because of the gender of my spouse? That's not religious stuff - that's legal stuff. Tax codes. But then, what about the other benefits? Why can't my spouse receive social security benefits if I die? Why can't she get my belongings without paying inheritance taxes, whereas if she was my federally-recognized legal spouse, there would be no inheritance taxes? Marriage isn't about monetary benefits, but they sure are nice, aren't they?

In order to have that working mothers have to stay home raise thoes kids and monitor their activities. Latch key kids aint a good Idea. It seems to me that same thought process led to the proposition that having fathers at home wasn't all that important either.
