Jim Webb take baby steps toward sanity. By David Sirota Apr. 04, 2009 | Finally, a little honesty. Finally, after America has frittered away billions of taxpayer dollars arming Latin American death squads, air-dropping toxic herbicides on equatorial farmland, and incarcerating more of its own citizens on nonviolent drug charges than any other industrialized nation, two political leaders last week tried to begin taming the most wildly out-of-control beast in the government zoo: federal narcotics policy. It started with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stating an embarrassingly obvious truth that politicians almost never discuss. In a speech about rising violence in Mexico, she said, \"Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade,\" and then added that \"we have co-responsibility\" for the cartel-driven carnage plaguing our southern border. She's right, of course. For all the Rambo-ish talk about waging a war on drugs that interdicts the supply of narcotics, we have not diminished demand -- specifically, demand for marijuana that cartels base their business on. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Americans spend about $9 billion a year on Mexican pot. Add that to the roughly $36 billion worth of domestically produced weed, and cannabis has become one of the continent's biggest cash crops. As any mob movie illustrates, mixing such \"insatiable\" demand for a product with statutes outlawing said product guarantees the emergence of a violent black market -- in this case, one in which Mexican drug cartels reap 62 percent of their profits from U.S. marijuana sales. -",
