Or do you have another alternative. For my part I always thought the thing was a bit engineered, not least because the ceasefire that the Serbs eventually signed was very much watered down from that pre-war ultimatum. Very odd, particularly because the whole cock-up further fed that idiotic Slavic pride and meant that any sort of rapprochement between Belgrade and Kosovo was impossible, even when Milosevic was gone and they could have started with a clean sheet. Instead Europe is lumbered with another ridiculously small and poor statelet. What makes it even stranger is that there was a rush to recognise Kosovo when are actually reasonably viable breakaway states like Somaliland that the international community fails to recognise. Serbia was fighting separatists & terrorists (domestic & foreign)! Were their actions somewhat heavy handed, sure, but not unreasonable or unexpected. Milosevic actually agreed on international presence in Kosovo, apparently he was sure he had nothing to worry about and ethnic cleansing was a myth at this point....we on the other hand demanded full military access to the entire area of Yugoslavia (including Serbia & Montenegro)although those areas had nothing to do with the supposed crimes! As far as a fresh start after Milosevic\u2026\u2026it was never going to happen\u2026\u2026.Ethnic cleansing of non-Albanians and destruction of Serbian property (including centuries old monasteries) continued unabated for years after the bombing & NATO supposed peacekeeping mission. Also, add the fact that newly \u201celected\u201d Kosovo officials were nearly all former members of KLA!",
