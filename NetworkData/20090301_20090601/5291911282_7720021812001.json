The friend does have symptoms of something and has not ever been in the military. The father was exposed to agent orange and trying to get his benifits even today. He keeps getting turned down. Knowing that children can collect benifits from inherited issues due to agent orange he wants my friend to try and get benifits for thier conditon. I am just trying to see what conditions has made this possible for others to do if they have. As far as the Bio goes. You can find me on many different message bords under the name mrdel or mr_del. I have not filled out a bio in any of them. I guess it has to do with my bipolar. Google can bring up all my posts I ever made. The mr_del name is not in use only by me thats why I changed it to mrdel. -Del",
