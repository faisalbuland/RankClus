There are some other things I would like to see in there, as well as more details. It sure seems better than the crap the Obama administration has been throwing around. Where was the line by line review, accountability and so on? People speak out about Bush's spending (many of us have spoken out), but yet are quiet when Obama is spending at record amounts. Oh, but it's all OK now, because Obama is signing for the spending. The blame goes around to many people, both Democrat and Republican. The Dem's and Repubs who signed porkulus with over 8,000 earmarks should be ashamed of themselves. Those who support Cap and Trade, the GWPRA, and carbon taxes, should as well be ashamed. So I guess you support the GWPRA, Carbon Taxes, and the Cap and trade scam? That will fix everything . People that have never generated an ounce of steam, or Watt of electricity are coming up with these scams. Many of these same folks are put in charge, whether it be a cabinet position, within the EPA, or just the writing of legislation. The fact that any of those ill equipped, ill informed folks are allowed to make decisions and draft policy is beyond me. When you refer to the great obstructionist party....are you talking about many Democrats, and their obstruction of further drilling and exploration? Pelosi and others have nerve saying anything about \"failed energy policy\". Ever been to the UAE Sea Witch? In 2006 their GDP grew by 35%. Oh the evil oil companies over here don't deserve to expand, create more jobs, and make us less dependent on imported oil. Those evil greedy Americans don't deserve any more wealth. Let's just keep it overseas. You talk of obstructionist policies? You need to know where to look. How can Obama talk about growing our economy, creating more jobs, and his famous \"tax cuts for 95% of Americans\" when he supports Cap and Trade along with energy taxes to boot ? Their energy taxes and cap and trade scams will be an increase on 100% of Americans. There was one thing that was most effective by way of environmental control's, and bettering the environment. Can you guess what that was? I'll give you a hint. It has been more effective and successful than Al Gore, the IPCC, the UN, and even the alarmists. It also has been and will be more effective than any scam they have on the drawing board. It has actually produced results, instead of hot air. You have people here calling the Republicans and some Democrats obstructionists, and they should, as one poster said in another thread \"shut up and let Obama do what he wants\". I'm glad some of these elected officials are obstructing policy that will lead us to disaster, rather than help. I am glad they are getting in the way of Cap and Trade, carbon taxes and the other scams they are throwing around. Many have woken up, and it's about damn time. Maybe some Democrats will run against Polosi, Dodd, Reid, and Frank. If not, I do hope there will be someone to put up a challenge. There are many others that need to be voted out on both sides as well.",
