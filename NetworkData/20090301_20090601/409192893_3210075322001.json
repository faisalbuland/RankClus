First, we rented out the carriage house and garden area from a beautiful local inn for the ceremony and reception. We also rented the groundkeeper's apartment and gardener's room above the carriage house for our stay. We ordered catering from the inn. We bought a huge tray of canolis from an Italian bakery in Boston's North End. While this was a hometown wedding for me, it was a destination wedding for my wife. We bought plane tickets for ourselves, and all of my wife's family (including cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws, and several of our close friends) bought plane tickets and rental vehicles to travel from the midwest to New Hampshire. Then, of course, they all rented hotel rooms for the course of their stay. People bought wedding gifts, souvenirs, and other things. They also patronized many local restaurants, museums, and other establishments during their stay. While our actual wedding only cost between two and three thousand dollars (dresses, rental location, catering, and decorations), we probably brought over $30,000 to the area between all our family members and ourselves. Additionally, young gay couples are often dual-income-no-kids households, and have more expendable income. If such a couple moves to an area, they'll buy stuff, pay taxes, and are less likely to have children who will drain off the system. If couples are able to support each other better, such as being able to let one person be placed on the other person's health insurance plan, then you have fewer uninsured people who end up going on state health insurance programs. There you go - even LESS of a drain on the government! So, never mind just the cost of the weddings... the economic boost is much bigger than that. But the states that have done this aren't just doing it for \"revenue.\" They're doing it because they realize that giving all groups equal rights doesn't diminish the rights of the majority.",

Negative population growth 2 years in a row is a fairly uncommon event. I can't prove the population loss and the allowing same sex marriages are connected, but it is suspect (at least to me) I suspect that the negative population growth is related to the re-location of hi-tech industries which used to employ many Massachusetts residents rather than the State Supreme Court's interpretation of the state Constitution which concluded that banning same-sex marriages violated the state's Constitution. I do find it interesting the number of state's rights conservatives from the 45 other states that want to pass a federal law to end same-sex marriage in the 5 states that allow it. They're usually the same people who yell, \"No other state or even the federal government should tell MY state what to do!

Nor do I believe that the Supreme court ruling is solely responsible, if it did at all factor into the population decline. This is not a \"decline in population growth\", it is a decline in population. Two years in the long run is statistically insignificant, the timing of the decline is the issue. Your statistics class should have also taught you that looking at one aspect of something (the money homosexuals spend on their weddings) does not give the true picture (thread title \"The costs of same-sex marriage to Massachusetts\") there are many other factors to be considered. Once all these factors are considered this may be a financial boom for Mass, I don't know. But to show the \"cost\" by looking at one aspect only is ridiculous. The car I bought is a great financial move because it has low insurance rates. (I won't mention that it cost 6 times more than most cars and only gets 2.3 MPG) This is a case of looking at what you want to find the results you want and reporting it.

That means that just because two men in my division on board the submarine are going bald does not mean that submariners are more likely to go bald. It doesn't mean anything at all aside from pointing out that there is a higher proportion of bald people in my workspace. The fact that we are in the same workspace does not mean that the workspace is making us go bald. There may be, and in this case are, other factors at work. You are trying to say that the correlation between the acceptance of gay marriage and a subsequent decline in population growth (over a statistically insignificant mere two year period no less) implies that one caused the other. It doesn't follow logically, especially in a situation where there are so many other variables.", 
        "reply": " I realize there I have no evidence that they are related (there I said it again). Nor do I believe that the Supreme court ruling is solely responsible, if it did at all factor into the population decline. This is not a \"decline in population growth\", it is a decline in population. Two years in the long run is statistically insignificant, the timing of the decline is the issue. Your statistics class should have also taught you that looking at one aspect of something (the money homosexuals spend on their weddings) does not give the true picture (thread title \"The costs of same-sex marriage to Massachusetts\") there are many other factors to be considered. Once all these factors are considered this may be a financial boom for Mass, I don't know. But to show the \"cost\" by looking at one aspect only is ridiculous. The car I bought is a great financial move because it has low insurance rates. (I won't mention that it cost 6 times more than most cars and only gets 2.3 MPG) This is a case of looking at what you want to find the results you want and reporting it. The press reported it, so it must be true and accurate picture of the whole thing.",

First, we rented out the carriage house and garden area from a beautiful local inn for the ceremony and reception. We also rented the groundkeeper's apartment and gardener's room above the carriage house for our stay. We ordered catering from the inn. We bought a huge tray of canolis from an Italian bakery in Boston's North End. While this was a hometown wedding for me, it was a destination wedding for my wife. We bought plane tickets for ourselves, and all of my wife's family (including cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws, and several of our close friends) bought plane tickets and rental vehicles to travel from the midwest to New Hampshire. Then, of course, they all rented hotel rooms for the course of their stay. People bought wedding gifts, souvenirs, and other things. They also patronized many local restaurants, museums, and other establishments during their stay. While our actual wedding only cost between two and three thousand dollars (dresses, rental location, catering, and decorations), we probably brought over $30,000 to the area between all our family members and ourselves. Additionally, young gay couples are often dual-income-no-kids households, and have more expendable income. If such a couple moves to an area, they'll buy stuff, pay taxes, and are less likely to have children who will drain off the system. If couples are able to support each other better, such as being able to let one person be placed on the other person's health insurance plan, then you have fewer uninsured people who end up going on state health insurance programs. There you go - even LESS of a drain on the government! So, never mind just the cost of the weddings... the economic boost is much bigger than that. But the states that have done this aren't just doing it for \"revenue.\" They're doing it because they realize that giving all groups equal rights doesn't diminish the rights of the majority.",

I can't prove the population loss and the allowing same sex marriages are connected, but it is suspect (at least to me) I suspect that the negative population growth is related to the re-location of hi-tech industries which used to employ many Massachusetts residents rather than the State Supreme Court's interpretation of the state Constitution which concluded that banning same-sex marriages violated the state's Constitution. I do find it interesting the number of state's rights conservatives from the 45 other states that want to pass a federal law to end same-sex marriage in the 5 states that allow it. They're usually the same people who yell, \"No other state or even the federal government should tell MY state what to do!

Watkinson, Minister of the Gospel from Ridleyville, Pennsylvania, quote: It was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. quote: The Congress passed the Act of April 22, 1864. This legislation changed the composition of the one-cent coin and authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864 two-cent coin. quote: The use of IN GOD WE TRUST has not been uninterrupted. The motto disappeared from the five-cent coin in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938. Since 1938, all United States coins bear the inscription. quote: A law passed by the 84th Congress (P.L. 84-140) and approved by the President on July 30, 1956, the President approved a Joint Resolution of the 84th Congress, declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States.
