So decrees the sicherheitsdienst of the obamanation.\" That's correct, it was RRR52 that is calling the Obama administration, \"the distinct vestiges of totalitarianism.\" I didn't write that, I criticised it sarcastically because it bears no merit! He is further insulting the Obama administration, by saying it's not permissable to even discuss the administration's intentions. And, going so far to say it's criminal and un-constitutional to speak against it, is pure horse manure! Furthermore, he is comparing the administration to the \"Sicherheitsdienst.\" The was a Nazi Party organization, and translated literally means \"the nazi party security police from 1933-45, and branch of the SS.\" It was made up of the Gestapo and the (Kripo)-Criminal Police. This branch was directly under the command of Reinhard Heydrich, who was directly under the overall head of the \"SS\" Henrich Himmler. Now, I was being sarcastic about it, because a sarcastic comment rightly deserves one in return. That's why my response - translated; \"How very Nazi Party-SS Security Police on the staff of the Reichs Leader SS (Himmler) of you,\" was appropriate. A horses azz comment, rightly deserves one in return! Duh! Bush wearing his neocon t-shirt, simply reiterated my point. This message has been edited.

        "reply": " Lets back up for a moment to see who really instigated this \"high intellect\" and incomplete analysis as you call it. \"Yes, the distinct vestiges of totalitarianism. . . not only behavior but our very thoughts must be jackass-pure and leftist-true. Daring to openly discuss the intentions and behavior of the messiah, the one--no matter how well-supported by the facts of the deepest influences of his life and the cult that falsifies the deep threat of his ideas and action for an American nation true to the Constitution and worthy of the patriots who created it--is verboten. So decrees the sicherheitsdienst of the obamanation.\" That's correct, it was RRR52 that is calling the Obama administration, \"the distinct vestiges of totalitarianism.\" I didn't write that, I criticised it sarcastically because it bears no merit! He is further insulting the Obama administration, by saying it's not permissable to even discuss the administration's intentions. And, going so far to say it's criminal and un-constitutional to speak against it, is pure horse manure! Furthermore, he is comparing the administration to the \"Sicherheitsdienst.\" The was a Nazi Party organization, and translated literally means \"the nazi party security police from 1933-45, and branch of the SS.\" It was made up of the Gestapo and the (Kripo)-Criminal Police. This branch was directly under the command of Reinhard Heydrich, who was directly under the overall head of the \"SS\" Henrich Himmler. Now, I was being sarcastic about it, because a sarcastic comment rightly deserves one in return. That's why my response - translated; \"How very Nazi Party-SS Security Police on the staff of the Reichs Leader SS (Himmler) of you,\" was appropriate. A horses azz comment, rightly deserves one in return! Duh! Bush wearing his neocon t-shirt, simply reiterated my point. This message has been edited.
