Excellent post, seems some folks have \"selective\" memories, when it comes to Presidents and actual recorded history... Again, excellent post... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 ADDED NOTE: I would be more worried about the \"water boarding\" aspects of it, than the suspension of \"freedom of the press\", especially, during time of war... Secrets are kept, very closely, in time of war and the restriction of the press, was in common practice in war, since the civil war... The press in the civil war printed troop movements and speculated, with some accuracy, on battle plans... The northern press helped greatly the southern cause and didn't give a rodent's rosey red rectum, as long as it sold newsprint... Thus leading to the military adopting the philosophy of, \"Fool me once, shame on you! Fool me twice, shame on me!\", when it came to the unrestricted freedom of the press during war time... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 As I pointed out in the related thread, Mr. Roosevelt has Congressional authorisation for his acts. As did Lincohn. The Constitution allows for itself to be suspended in whole or in part, as long as it is done legally. In this case, the memo Mr. Bush recieved claimed that he, personally, One Man, could do whatever he damned well pleased. Dave Let me know if you want to borrow a hankie, Dave.",

Excellent post, seems some folks have \"selective\" memories, when it comes to Presidents and actual recorded history... Again, excellent post... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 ADDED NOTE: I would be more worried about the \"water boarding\" aspects of it, than the suspension of \"freedom of the press\", especially, during time of war... Secrets are kept, very closely, in time of war and the restriction of the press, was in common practice in war, since the civil war... The press in the civil war printed troop movements and speculated, with some accuracy, on battle plans... The northern press helped greatly the southern cause and didn't give a rodent's rosey red rectum, as long as it sold newsprint... Thus leading to the military adopting the philosophy of, \"Fool me once, shame on you! Fool me twice, shame on me!\", when it came to the unrestricted freedom of the press during war time... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 As I pointed out in the related thread, Mr. Roosevelt has Congressional authorisation for his acts. As did Lincohn. The Constitution allows for itself to be suspended in whole or in part, as long as it is done legally. In this case, the memo Mr. Bush recieved claimed that he, personally, One Man, could do whatever he damned well pleased. Dave Given a pressing emergency... The Constitution allows for the President to act \"unilaterally\", without Congress, till Congress can take the matter under consideration, it's called, \"The War Powers Act\"... Now, could he do what he accused of?... Good question, there has been precedence for it... Lincoln during the civil war, Roosevelt prior to and during the Second World War... Truman during Korea and this is the most interesting of all, hostilities and no declaration of war... Many different and interesting speculations can be made... Personally, I find that any time, a President acts \"unilaterally\" and does not have \"authorization\", I begin to worry... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
