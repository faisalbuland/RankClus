Mon May 11, 4:56 PM TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Taiwanese man became a sitting target for a snake, which bit his ***** as sat on the toilet at his rural home, local media reported on Monday. \"As soon as he sat down, he suddenly felt a knife-like pain and reacted instinctively by standing up,\" the China Times said. \"When he looked down, he saw the big snake.\" The 51-year-old man, from Nantou County, was under medical care with minor injuries, a director at Puli Christian Hospital said. \"As soon as he has passed the risk of infection, he can go,\" the director, who declined to be named, said. \"A snake's mouth isn't always clean.\" Local television images showed the black and yellow reptile, reportedly a species of rat snake, being uncoiled and plucked slowly from the toilet bowl. Snakes regularly enter rural homes in Taiwan and other sub-tropical regions of Asia. (Reporting by Ralph Jennings; Editing by Nick Macfie and Miral Fahmy)",

Don't know how it is now but, back in the days of the \"BROWN SHOE\" military and no, I'm not really that old but, my Dad was, we got into our sleeping bags with our uniforms and boots on... Just left your \"TA\" i.e. web gear outside and you, if you had one, brought your sidearm into the bag with you, rifle if you were issued one but, made it sorta hard to get it out and in operation, the rifle that is, should things get sorta dicey...
