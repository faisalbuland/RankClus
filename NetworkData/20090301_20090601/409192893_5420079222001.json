Top Pelosi Aide Learned Of Waterboarding in 2003 By Paul Kane Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday, May 9, 2009 A top aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attended a CIA briefing in early 2003 in which it was made clear that waterboarding and other harsh techniques were being used in the interrogation of an alleged al-Qaeda operative, according to documents the CIA released to Congress on Thursday. Pelosi has insisted that she was not directly briefed by Bush administration officials that the practice was being actively employed. But Michael Sheehy, a top Pelosi aide, was present for a classified briefing that included Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.), then the ranking minority member of the House intelligence committee, at which agency officials discussed the use of waterboarding on terrorism suspect Abu Zubaida. A Democratic source acknowledged yesterday that it is almost certain that Pelosi would have learned about the use of waterboarding from Sheehy. Pelosi herself acknowledged in a December 2007 statement that she was aware that Harman had learned of the waterboarding and had objected in a letter to the CIA's top counsel. US appears guilty of torture: Pelosi - AFP , October, 2007 WASHINGTON (AFP) \u2014 The United States appears to be illegally torturing terror suspects contrary to denials by President George W. Bush, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday. The country's highest ranking Democrat also said that she still hoped to get most US troops out of Iraq by the end of 2008, despite the party's repeated failure to win over enough Republicans in Congress to an exit strategy. Interviewed on Fox News Sunday, Pelosi said reported interrogation tactics such as simulated drowning, head slapping and exposure to extreme temperatures all amounted to banned torture. \"There is a legal definition of torture that I believe this would fit.

The reaction to his slander - or rather, the lack of reaction - speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of the American left. Speaking in the Senate on May 10, Kennedy had this to say about the Abu Ghraib prison scandal: ''On March 19, 2004, President Bush asked, 'Who would prefer that Saddam's torture chambers still be open?' Shamefully, we now learn that Saddam's torture chambers reopened under new management - US management.'' \u2026This was not a blurted, off-the-cuff comment - Kennedy was reading from a prepared text. It was not a shocked first reaction to the abuses at Abu Ghraib - the story had broken more than a week earlier.

The images horrified us and severely damaged our reputation in the Middle East and around the world.\" Kennedy continued... \"\u2026Where are we a year later? Has this problem been resolved? Has the moral authority of the U.S. been restored? Have we recovered from what is perhaps the steepest and deepest fall from grace in our history?\" \"Sadly, the answer is no, because at every opportunity, the Administration has tried to minimize the problem and avoid responsibility for it. The tone was set at the very start. Senior-level military commanders knew about the problems much earlier. They knew about Abu Ghraib photos as early as January 2004.

Scary is that President Obama has an agenda that is as radical as that of FDR - the difference is there is no effective Republican Party to oppose him. Now there are some good ideas in that agenda. Health care must be fixed and it takes a strong leader to get it done. But Republicans should have an effective voice in that policy. The Republicans in the '30s were organized in their opposition to some of the more outrages FDR policies and managed to tone some others down. Today, the Republican Party is too disorganized, too petty and many of the \u201cbase\u201d want someone who is like the average Joe the plumber for a leader - someone who is not smart enough to push back on the Obama agenda. Those who say that President Obama is an empty suit are just foolishly repeating what Rush told them. President Obama is very smart and while he may do much good for the country, too much power without opposition is not good. The Pelosi thing is just a distraction \u2013 red meat for the Republican Base. Meanwhile, the President has managed to pass fuel standards that would have been unthinkable four years ago. After a while, the Republicans will be chewing on some bones that have been tossed to them and becoming less and less relevant. To the detriment of the country.",

OK, Pelosi lied to the press and the American public. Politicians lying is not a crime. Now What? Doesn't it strike you as a little wrong for Pelosi to try and prosecute those she sent to do her dirty work... all the while knowing she and the others agreed - but because it is a top secret meeting - she didn't think anyone would find out... Come-on - what's wrong with that picture... and just think - what else has she deliberately lied about - skewed and twisted for liberal agenda... There is plenty wrong with that picture and much more is wrong with Nancy Pelosi than her lying about what she knew about torture. She, nor anyone else, will be able to prosecute anyone for the policy of torture that the Bush Administration carried out. She did not lie under oath, so there is no crime. She has lost power because her credibility is now in question. And the Republican base has something legitimate to b tch about (instead of making things up.) Now what? The Republicans going after Pelosi helps President Obama. She is too divisive and even more liberal than President Obama. She has got in the way of several Obama proposals, or made it more difficult for him to further his agenda. The Republicans (and many independence like me) may not like Pelosi, but if she is out and Steny Hoyer becomes Speaker, the Obama Administration will be able to move even more of its agenda though Congress. The Republicans are focusing on petty things like Pelosi lying to the American public and stirring up the base with fear tactics like \u201cObama is going to release terrorists into the United States and give them welfare\u201d (which is a lie) because they have no real leadership. Meanwhile, President Obama is building a \u201cnew foundation\u201d for the country and Republicans are clueless about how to be effective counterweights like they should be. I agree with that - though it's a little scary to think she is third in line for the captain seat... I agree though - politically, they should beat her up - then save all the footage for reruns later when it becomes useful artillery...", 
        "reply": " Scary is that President Obama has an agenda that is as radical as that of FDR - the difference is there is no effective Republican Party to oppose him. Now there are some good ideas in that agenda. Health care must be fixed and it takes a strong leader to get it done. But Republicans should have an effective voice in that policy. The Republicans in the '30s were organized in their opposition to some of the more outrages FDR policies and managed to tone some others down. Today, the Republican Party is too disorganized, too petty and many of the \u201cbase\u201d want someone who is like the average Joe the plumber for a leader - someone who is not smart enough to push back on the Obama agenda. Those who say that President Obama is an empty suit are just foolishly repeating what Rush told them. President Obama is very smart and while he may do much good for the country, too much power without opposition is not good. The Pelosi thing is just a distraction \u2013 red meat for the Republican Base. Meanwhile, the President has managed to pass fuel standards that would have been unthinkable four years ago. After a while, the Republicans will be chewing on some bones that have been tossed to them and becoming less and less relevant. To the detriment of the country.",
