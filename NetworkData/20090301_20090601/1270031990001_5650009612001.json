And yet many there are who will take wholesale their moral guidance from a book that allows rape\u2026 just like it appears to forbid so much else it also allows so much else. But distorting the Bible is many a believers\u2019 favorite pastime, by carefully detoured around all the nasty stuff in the Bible. So grab your Bibles and follow along as we scan across the ages of some of the nasty rapes that bible folks don't want to tell you about. Sometimes it is often referred to \"taking a wife\". The act of involuntary marriages. Judges 21:10-24 So they (the chosen of God) sent twelve thousand warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children. \"This is what you are to do,\" they said. \"Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin.\" Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh \u2026\u2026\u2026 later they throw a party because they didn\u2019t get enough women to satisfy their \u2018need\u2019 and needing more went and set up an ambush and They kidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance. Anyhow, they \u201cbiblically\u201d (meaning for the Lord) killed and raped an entire town and then wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road to kidnap and rape some more. Numbers 31:7-18 is Moses in action and scolding (that what he does best) his horde for killing women before they could use them, and then instructs them to kill some more (boys mostly) but Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves. Orgy time! But of course these virgins are not of the right religion or race so I guess it\u2019s ok? It\u2019s no wonder their neighbors to be didn\u2019t trust or like them! And there is more: Deuteronomy 20:10-14 can be summed up with this revealing part When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill every man in the town. But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder. You may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you. I wonder if the Founders just forgot to include this in the founding documents? Maybe it could be retroactively applied to our wars we are in now? I know some solders who could \u2018dig it\u2019. One is in prison already for \u201cobeying\u201d that part\u2026 maybe he should have used the Bible to defend himself? This one is the Law of Rape, but it only applied to the ones chosen to be lucky enough to have such a generous fair and loving God: Deuteronomy 22:28-29 If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her. An early form of the \u2018shotgun wedding\u2019. What a pleasant family that must be\u2026 \u201cDaddy raped my mommy and now I\u2019m here.\u201d PTL. Deuteronomy 22:23-24 may or may not include rape but it sounds like something that should be in the UCMJ? If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife Got rocks? Anyway, you get the drift\u2026 and there is more, and some of it goes off into polygamy and more rape: 2 Samuel 12:11-14; Deuteronomy 21:10-14; Judges 5:30; Exodus 21:7-11; Zechariah 14:1-2 (not many people read old Zechariah but there is a phrase there that the Lord uses on his own \u2018chosen ones\u2019 which can be translated women ravished) And so on, and on, and on\u2026.. and we call our selves a Bible believing nation! We forget so many things the Lord will allow with his good book! Speaking of \u201cchild rape\u201d, how old was Jesus\u2019 mommy when she got pregnant out of wedlock and ended up betrothed to a man much older than she? Thirteen maybe?

Actually, the general idea for what I posted comes from a rather 'aggressive' web site I can no longer find, but the stories I know well. I am especially amazed how the bible thumping Xians constantly refer to the stuff Moses concocted to manage his herd/flock. Considering the New Testament makes its faith based references to Abraham, 440 some years before Moses and the Law, or the imputation of sin on everyone, these fighting fundies will drive home their own specially selected legal references to terrorize anyone they determine needs it... and all in the name of the loving god. Even if the bulk of the stories are fiction and myth, you'd still think they could get the major premises down right! It always amuses me that Jesus has his biggest problems with the same type of overly religious 'law abiding' fundamentalist folks in his day!",

LJ Let's see...Lot, the only man deemed worthy enough to be permitted to escape Sodom's destruction with his family...how did he view rape? Two strangers under his roof; townspeople want to rape them; Lot says, \"Take my daughters instead.\" So Lot apparently thought rape is only bad when it happens to strange men under your protection. Those crazy Bedouin traditions! Judges chapter 19...a Levite stays in a strange city with a kindly old man; city dwellers demand the old man give them the Levite so they can rape him; old man says, \"No, take my daughter and the Levite's concubine instead;\" city dwellers rape the hell out of the concubine; the Levite \"thanks\" her (for taking HIS gang-raping) by cutting her up into 12 pieces with a knife. I guess he assumed she enjoyed it, because she had been \"playing the wh0re\" earlier in their travels. So you can't be a rape victim if you have a checkered past. Deuteronomy 20: 10-14...If you attack a city and they surrender, make 'em all your slaves. But if they resist, kill all the men and rape all the virgins. That's what I call WIN-WIN! Deuteronomy 22:23 through 27...if a virgin gets raped in the city, stone her to death, because it's assumed she didn't cry out. If she gets raped in the field, she gets to live, lucky girl, because it's assumed she cried out. So a victim's reaction to rape is ASSUMED, based upon where the rape happened! But confusingly, 28 & 29 says that if a man rapes a virgin, he has to pay HER FATHER, and then he MUST MARRY her, and can't divorce her. That'll teach him! Judges 21: 10-24...Israel kicks its enemy's butt, and takes all the virgins as (literally) trophy wives; but ALAS there aren't enough virgins for all the soldiers. Solution? Some other folks are having a dance; let's go hide in the bushes, and when we see their virgins, we'll take THEM! Don't you just hate it when there aren't enough virgin rape victims to go around? Now, LJ, you may not call this \"condoning\" rape in the Buy-Bull (although I do), but there is certainly no condemnation of rape in general. What an enlightened book!",

The prophets started many of their declarations that way, but they're still just human, aren't they? If you are suggesting that \"Thus sayeth the Lord\" is preamble to parts of the Buy-Bull that you believe to be the word of God, aren't you (a human) subjectively choosing? Those words were, after all, spoken and recorded by humans. All words spoken in churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, etc. are spoken by humans. For that matter, Jesus was just a human. Anything that suggests otherwise was suggested by humans. Once again, I'll point out that this is the problem with believing in INVISIBLE, INAUDIBLE beings. You end up taking someone else's word for what the being says or wants. Or you ask others to take YOUR word for it. Both amount to hearsay evidence, which is ultimately no evidence at all.",

Did you want to discuss each of them, or do you think you could get to the point? SteveDeHaven, You are one funny guy. To get to the point on your last post and not comment again on your verbosity, I will respond to your 2 (points, comments or post). 1. I guess the fact that you got hits on your post is an indication that you said something important. OK if that is what you think, I will leave it at that. 2. My main point: quote: Originally posted by SteveDeHaven (in black) and All4truth (in blue): Deuteronomy 22:23 through 27...if a virgin gets raped in the city, stone her to death, because it's assumed she didn't cry out. If she gets raped in the field, she gets to live, lucky girl, because it's assumed she cried out. So a victim's reaction to rape is ASSUMED, based upon where the rape happened! So you are saying that this recording of actions teaches that God condoned the actions? Not how I read it. This is a harsh punishment, I would agree. But a man made one trying to interpret God's desires. Have you ever searched online versions of scripture for the words 'Thus said or sayeth' the Lord. Then read what follows to understand that God has always sent messengers to correct what has been taught about Him. Finally He even sent His Son to correct certain teachings of men. But that type of information would destroy your position and statement so I understand you want to hide that it. This is the quote as it was originally written unless my copy and pasting caused an error somewhere. You can scroll back up and read it for yourself. a. Have you searched the biblical text in this manner (Thus said the Lord) and taken note of what followed? b. How do you take the parts of scripture commonly referred to as new testament? I only asked to understand if you are commenting about the Bible as 1. A single book 2. Individual works to be validated or thrown out. 3. Just some text that you can use to justify an argument or position. Since we do not believe or agree on God then I would expect we have to agree on how we are discussing the text to have any kind of discussion. Otherwise it would seem you are on 'Religion in the Military' simply to be an antagonist. If there is another set of conclusions, please enlighten me in your follow up post. LJ",
