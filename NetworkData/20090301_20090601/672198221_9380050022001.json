F-16 aircraft from the Minnesota Air National Guard initially scrambled out of Duluth, Minn., were replaced by fighters from the Wisconsin Air National Guard based out of Madison, Wisc., who then handed off the pursuit to the Louisiana Air National Guard fighters from New Orleans.

The pilot, identified by police as 31-year-old Adam Dylan Leon, eventually landed the plane on a rural road, reportedly tried to hide it under a bridge, and hitched a ride to a nearby grocer. Inside, he bought a bottle of Gatorade and waited for 30 minutes before being arrested. \"The plane was put down, the suspect fled the aircraft on foot, and local authorities subsequently picked him up,\" said RCMP superintendent Tim Cogan. (...) \"He had access [to the hangar, so obviously there's some connection, but I'm not sure what that connection is,\" Supt. Cogan said, adding the man was a Canadian citizen. CNN reported a suicide note was found near the hangar. The pilot got in a Cessna 172 single-engine plane with full fuel tanks, and took off. (...) \"He did land on his own accord, and he's currently under the jurisdiction of local authorities,\" North American Aerospace Defense Command Master Sergeant Claudette Hutchinson said. After landing the plane around 9:45 ET, the suspect fled into the woods, Missouri State Highway Patrol Sergeant Marty Elmore said. According to staff at nearby grocery store and restaurant, he hitched a ride with another person before entering Simmons Grocery & Hardware, near Ellsinore. He used the facilities and bought a drink. \"He sat in here in the store with us for like 30 minutes. He heard us talking about people looking for a man who was running from the law,\" said Teresa Davidson, 41, a cashier at the place. Mr. Leon tried to buy beef jerky and a lemon-lime Gatorade, but only had enough for the drink, she said. \"He did seem a little nervous, but he didn't act strange or nothing,\" Ms. Davidson told The Globe and Mail. Then, around 10:20 ET, \"Oh man there was just cops everywhere, they just came in and got him.\" He went peacefully, she said. Staff identified him as an outsider when he asked to use a \"washroom\" instead of a \"bathroom.\" (...) This message has been edited. Last edited by: Canuck_Centaur, Tue 07 April 2009 12:05 PM",
