Not only are the remnants of the internment camp there, but the lava fields were the site of the final act of the Modoc Wars, where Gen. Canfield was murdered during peace negotiations with Capt. Jack. Of course, you should remember that all those maginficent, snow-capped mountains around there are active volcanoes!",

More hieroglyphs. Captain Jacks HQ was not very big but it provided great cover and his soldiers were excellent shots. There is a monolith near there that is sacred to the Modoc and has many hieroglyphics. One of the many caves they hid in. A Wama Suc Abinake of mine friend stands in the prayer circle of the Modoc.

Enjoy those potatoes and onions, cause they are being grown in the old lake bed. 200 Modoc men women and children held off the US Army. The terrain doesn't look too bad until you try to walk a distance in a straight line. It's Lava rock and it's sharp and pointy. Sacred rock, lava rock and determination kept these people in their caves. The trails are from the Modocs seige but mainly there because of the parks design. They have a short trail and a long trail. A lot of natural hiding places. Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
