The journo shows and describes the quality and skills of the troops, discussing how much better equipped, and more experienced they are now at this kind of warfare.

The gist of his article was that WP does cause massive burns. Such as those treating burned civilians noted. The USAF uses a Mark 77 incendiary bomb containing neo-napalm and WP. Helicopters are able to deploy WP 'shake and bake' rounds. Sorties by rotary-wing AC are not 'counted' in tac air reports. Accusations have been made, this time as well, that WP was deployed by the taliban, ostensibly against a target being bombed by coalition forces. The latter might explain his reference to craters. Common usage of WP is to get them out in the open,and kill them with HE. Not having been there during the attack, and having \"no knowledge about the military\", the writer can be excused this blunder. Of late, the only forces admitting to use WP in Afghanistan, for whatever 'valid military purpose', and in this instant denying its use, are coalition forces. Ps: Like lots of us he reads wrong too, but that's no sin. The dead soldier's name was 'Richard DEWATER' the article says his mates called him 'tricky'. He'd been killed by an IED.

If one has never served one is hardly able to tell what was tactically correct. *From ISAF (U) Discussion: Three means of white phosphorus use and access by insurgents can be identified: 1) improvised explosive devices 2) indirect fire attacks 3) ordnance caches or UXO. It is notable that the enemy has stockpiled and used white phosphorus in attacks since 2003 and as recently as the week prior to this release. It should also be noted that these instances have occurred in nearly every province in RC-East, which demonstrates the wide availability of white phosphorus to insurgents. Finally, it is important to note that insurgent stockpiles do not necessarily derive from old Soviet-era left-behind stocks; the white phosphorus munitions found in these 38 events have their origins in a wide range of countries. Also, the vast majority of white phosphorus rounds found in listed caches were determined to be in serviceable condition. 1. Improvised Explosive Devices using White Phosphorus: (U) 1.1 On 5 FEB 2009, an ISAF unit observed a white phosphorus detonation, determined to be a 107mm WP rocket IED, near a civilian district center in Sabari District, Khost province.

If one has never served one is hardly able to tell what was tactically correct. *From ISAF (U) Discussion: Three means of white phosphorus use and access by insurgents can be identified: 1) improvised explosive devices 2) indirect fire attacks 3) ordnance caches or UXO. It is notable that the enemy has stockpiled and used white phosphorus in attacks since 2003 and as recently as the week prior to this release. It should also be noted that these instances have occurred in nearly every province in RC-East, which demonstrates the wide availability of white phosphorus to insurgents. Finally, it is important to note that insurgent stockpiles do not necessarily derive from old Soviet-era left-behind stocks; the white phosphorus munitions found in these 38 events have their origins in a wide range of countries. Also, the vast majority of white phosphorus rounds found in listed caches were determined to be in serviceable condition. 1. Improvised Explosive Devices using White Phosphorus: (U) 1.1 On 5 FEB 2009, an ISAF unit observed a white phosphorus detonation, determined to be a 107mm WP rocket IED, near a civilian district center in Sabari District, Khost province.
