This same thing happened with females in the Israeli military. Is anyone surprised? I sure wish it were not so. Helen Benedict the author and the book came out in the US on Wed. The title is \"the Lonely Soldier: the private war of women in Iraq.\" The author interviewed 40 women. The article goes on to say that up to 79% of females since WW2 have been sexually mistreated in the military. Perhaps combat duty ought be left to males would be my conclusion. Men ought to view females as respected and tender human beings. The Bra burners of the 60's and 70's now reap the whirwind of their equality bullsquat. They wanted it and they got it much to American shame. This message has been edited. Last edited by: 5727609, Fri 17 April 2009 04:34 PM",

        "reply": "Hi, my name is Catherine and I plan on joining the military. I think it's horrible that any women is raped. They have the right to fight in the military as the men do without being raped. I plan to get my degree and help military women who have been raped and abused. I want to help them get better. For all the women in the military out there who have been raped here is someone you can talk to and her name is Sorry, it is not a good idea to post someones personal information on a Forum read worldwide. If someone wants the information about who and how to contact, they can add you as a friend, and then email you for the information. To all the victim's out there we are with you we care.

The title is \"the Lonely Soldier: the private war of women in Iraq.\" The author interviewed 40 women. The article goes on to say that up to 79% of females since WW2 have been sexually mistreated in the military. Perhaps combat duty ought be left to males would be my conclusion.

They have the right to fight in the military as the men do without being raped. I plan to get my degree and help military women who have been raped and abused. I want to help them get better. For all the women in the military out there who have been raped here is someone you can talk to and her name is Sorry, it is not a good idea to post someones personal information on a Forum read worldwide. If someone wants the information about who and how to contact, they can add you as a friend, and then email you for the information. To all the victim's out there we are with you we care.
