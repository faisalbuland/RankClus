Our daughters, the two oldest kids, came to us when started high school, (They were always in they same grade.) and asked how much money did we think we spent on their clothing and personal things. We said an average of about $10.00 \u2013 15.00 a week average. How about doing this; you give us each $30.00 a week now allowance. We keep the same giving and savings rules on the $30.00 a week and we buy and choose our own personal things. They said, this is a good deal for you and it lets us buy what we want to buy. We said fine, we thought it would last about a month. It lasted the rest of the time they lived at home. They both had summer and weekend jobs. The girls were and still are the best money managers I know. They had about $10,000.00 each in savings when graduated from high school.

Any money the earned went: 25% to savings 10% to church or same as above. 15% to house hold expenses. 50% rest was theirs\u2019 When we paid for their things, we chose them. If they paid for it, it still had to meet family our standards. It was never a problem. The spacing between birthdates was 15 months, 25 months and 6 \u00bd years. Our daughters, the two oldest kids, came to us when started high school, (They were always in they same grade.) and asked how much money did we think we spent on their clothing and personal things. We said an average of about $10.00 \u2013 15.00 a week average. How about doing this; you give us each $30.00 a week now allowance. We keep the same giving and savings rules on the $30.00 a week and we buy and choose our own personal things. They said, this is a good deal for you and it lets us buy what we want to buy. We said fine, we thought it would last about a month. It lasted the rest of the time they lived at home. They both had summer and weekend jobs. The girls were and still are the best money managers I know. They had about $10,000.00 each in savings when graduated from high school. The boys didn\u2019t become good money managers until they got married. God and the soldier, All men adore, In time of trouble, And no more; For when war is over, And all things righted, God is neglected - The old soldier slighted.
