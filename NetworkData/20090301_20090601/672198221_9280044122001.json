Among the senior rebels who turned themselves in was the Tigers' main mouthpiece to the outside world, chief spokesman Velayudam Dayanidi, who is better known as Daya Master. Another official, who once served as an aide to the late head of the Tigers' political wing, S.P. Thamilselvan, also surrendered. The defence ministry spokesman said more than 100,000 people had fled the shrinking patch of territory still controlled by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), adding troops were \"rescuing\" civilians caught up in the war. (...) The apparent endgame in Sri Lanka has triggered protests around the world, with up to 30,000 Tamil demonstrators clogging the Canadian capital Ottawa to demand a ceasefire. Similar rallies have been held in London and Paris. The LTTE were once considered one of the world's most efficient guerilla outfits, lording over a third of Sri Lanka's territory and running a de facto mini-state. A Norwegian-brokered truce between the government and the rebels began falling apart in December 2005, and fighting since then has seen the progressive collapse of the rebel army. Last month the UN's human rights chief said both sides in the conflict may be guilty of war crimes.",
