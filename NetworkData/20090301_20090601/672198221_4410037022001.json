The study released today by the Pew Hispanic Center highlights a growing dilemma in the immigration debate: Illegal immigrants' children born in the United States are American citizens, yet they struggle in poverty and uncertainty along with parents who fear deportation, toil largely in low-wage jobs and face layoffs in an ailing economy. The analysis by Pew, a nonpartisan research organization, estimated that 11.9 million illegal immigrants lived in the U.S. Of those, 8.3 million were in the labor force as of March 2008, making up 5.4 percent of the U.S. work force, primarily in lower-paying farming, construction or janitorial work. Roughly three out of four of their children \u2014 or 4 million \u2014 were born in the U.S. In 2003, 2.7 million children of illegal immigrants, or 63 percent, were born in this country. Overall, illegal immigrants' children account for one of every 15 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Read full article here >>> >http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6372823.html",

The LAUSD would be a whole lot better if children born to legal immigrants were the only ones in these schools. The vast majority of illegal immigrants fully expect the government to take care of everything....this is a damn fact, believe me. Sometimes I get the impression that these parents simply consider the school system another form of day care....its sad and a damn waste of my tax dollars.",
