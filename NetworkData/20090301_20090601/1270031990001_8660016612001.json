Time Travel can not exist. Fundamental Theory Of Existence. Let us consider x, y and z as any three numbers. If we take an equation such that x / y = z then x = y * z. 4 / 0 is said to be infinity. If 4 / 0 is equal to infinity, 4 / 0 = infinity then 4 = 0 * infinity, that is 4 = 0 but 4 is not equal to 0 therefore 4 / 0 is not equal to infinity. What is infinity? Infinity means not finite. If infinity means not finite then infinity can not be a number. Therefore infinity is not a number. When we divide a finite number with another finite number we get a finite answer but not infinity. Therefore any finite number divided by any finite number is equal to some finite number. For example 4 divided by 4 is equal to 1. The numerator is 4 which is a finite number. The denominator is 4 which is again a finite number. Now 4 / 4 is equal to 1 and once again 1 is a finite number. Therefore the result of dividing a finite number with another finite number is also a finite number. 4 / 0 is sometimes said to be undefined or not defined. If it is so then let us define it. We already know that 4 / 0 should give us a finite number. 0 / 4 means we are dividing the numerator 0 with the denominator 4. Zero means nothing. Dividing 0 with 4 means dividing nothing into 4 parts, it means we are not dividing anything. Therefore 0 in the numerator means we have nothing to divide. What does 4 in the denominator mean? 4 in the denominator means we are dividing the numerator into 4 parts that is we are converting the numerator into 4 parts. Now that we know what denominator means we will discuss 4 / 0. 0 in the denominator means dividing the numerator that is 4 into zero parts. Mind you, 0 in the denominator does not mean we are not dividing. Zero in the denominator actually means we are converting the numerator into zero parts. If we can divide the numerator into zero parts then each part is equal to zero. But sum of zeroes does not give us 4. Therefore 4 can not be divided by 0. In fact numerator can not be divided by 0. Therefore 0 can not exist as denominator. It is true that the numerator can not be divided into zero parts and it is also true that sum of zeroes does not give anything but zero. Therefore 1. Zero can not exist as denominator. The fact that the numerator can not be divided into zero parts means anything that exists can not be destroyed into nothingness. And the fact that sum of zeroes gives us zero alone means anything that does not exist can not be given existence out of nothingness. Therefore 2. Anything can not be created out of nothingness, only change of form is possible and change is everywhere. 3. Anything can not be destroyed into nothingness, only change of form is possible and change is everywhere. Once again we need to know what infinite means. What does infinite mean? Infinite means not finite and not finite means unlimited. By now we know that creation and destruction are impossible. If creation is impossible then there is no other way new things can add up to the World that already exists. If new things can not add up to the World then there is no way anything that exists in this World can be infinite. Therefore 4. Existence of anything can not be infinite. Numbers are infinite but number of apples ( existence ) can not be infinite. Now, we know that creation and destruction are impossible and we also know that the existence of anything can not be infinite. We are part of the world we live in. In our world existence of anything can not be infinite. That is Space, Mass, Energy, Density, Gravity, Force,... etc; can not be infinite. Also, in our World creation and destruction are impossible. Creation is impossible means no new things can add up to the World that already exists and it also means what already exists can not come out of creation. Creation is impossible, creation is completely ruled out. We also know that destruction of the World is impossible. Therefore 5. There is no beginning and an end to the existence of the World. We know what an equation means. An equation is a law of equity. If creation and destruction are possible then all laws have to fail. In a World where creation and destruction are possible laws can not exist, only Chaos exists. Therefore 6. There are finite absolute laws. E = M C2 has another side to it. E stands for the energy of the electromagnetic radiation, M is the intrinsic mass of the electromagnetic radiation and C is the velocity of the electromagnetic radiation. Any ordinary body can be moved and therefore its velocity is relative at constant gravity. Electromagnetic radiation travels on its own, it can not be moved like any ordinary body by moving the source of the electromagnetic radiation. Therefore velocity of electromagnetic radiation is observed to be constant at constant gravity. When there is considerable change in gravity there is change in velocity of the electromagnetic radiation. Therefore velocity of electromagnetic radiation is relative to change in gravity. E = M C2 F = M g E = ( F/g ) C2 7. Velocity of anything is relative. Everything is well defined in three dimensions. Space too is three dimensional. String Theory claims more than three dimensions. Time is an imaginary dimension. Existence of anything short of three dimensions is impossible since anything that exists can not be destroyed into nothingness. If more than three dimensions can exist, they have to exist everywhere and always. Since anything can not be created out of nothingness more than three dimensions can not be given existence out of nothingness. Therefore String Theory can not be true. 8. There are three dimensions and three dimensions only. Therefore anything short of three dimensions and more than three dimensions is impossible. Time is an imaginary dimension. Time Travel is impossible since Time is an imaginary dimension. 9. Time Travel can not exist. There are no infinite parallel Worlds with infinite parallel changes and we can not Time Travel. Time Travel is meaningless.

If this were truly the description of space, it would cease to exist and would disappear in a wink or not exist in the first place. It did not, so there must be more to it. There is a fourth dimension to space and that is the fabric of space or what we perceive as gravity. Gravity appears when matter is inserted into space creating a rent. Gravity of space then resists and pushes back to close the rent and in doing so pushes matter together. Space is continually forcing matter together to reach a state of equilibrium of a space without matter. Gravity is not a force of matter; it is a force of space itself and only appears when matter is intruding into space. Gravity waves will remain undiscovered, as they do not exist unless you think of space as one giant gravity wave. Gravity is a force against matter that opposes its intrusion into space. . This gravity force of space is a weak force but enough to retard the speed of light and keep it constant along with radio wave propagation. .",

And finally, to the original author of the content; I suspect that blogger is a junior college studant or just a \"dabbler\" in the arcane arts of Physics, Stellar Mechanics, and Calculus.....plus I further suspect that (to judge by his repetition), he likely had induldged in some mind-altering substance and suddenly thought that he had gained insight into life, the universe, and everything! After he sobered up (if he has yet), he was probably too embarrassed to even reconsider his overall thesis, much less edit or delete it! There's a moral in there somewhere!

Declare, if thou hast understanding.\" Our own era's physical theories about the big bang cannot quite reach back to an ultimate beginning from nothing--although in mathematics we can generate all numbers from the empty set.

        "content": "Wednesday, September 24, 2008 Fundamental Theory Of Existence. Name: Sagar Gorijala 'http://sagargorijala.blogspot.com/ Fundamental Theory Of Existence. 1. Zero can not exist as denominator. 2. Anything can not be created out of nothingness, only change of form is possible and change is everywhere. 3. Anything can not be destroyed into nothingness, only change of form is possible and change is everywhere. 4. Existence of anything can not be infinite. 5. There is no beginning and an end to the existence of the World. 6. There are finite absolute laws. 7. Velocity of anything is relative. 8. There are three dimensions and three dimensions only. 9. Time Travel can not exist. Fundamental Theory Of Existence. Let us consider x, y and z as any three numbers. If we take an equation such that x / y = z then x = y * z. 4 / 0 is said to be infinity. If 4 / 0 is equal to infinity, 4 / 0 = infinity then 4 = 0 * infinity, that is 4 = 0 but 4 is not equal to 0 therefore 4 / 0 is not equal to infinity. What is infinity? Infinity means not finite. If infinity means not finite then infinity can not be a number. Therefore infinity is not a number. When we divide a finite number with another finite number we get a finite answer but not infinity. Therefore any finite number divided by any finite number is equal to some finite number. For example 4 divided by 4 is equal to 1. The numerator is 4 which is a finite number. The denominator is 4 which is again a finite number. Now 4 / 4 is equal to 1 and once again 1 is a finite number. Therefore the result of dividing a finite number with another finite number is also a finite number. 4 / 0 is sometimes said to be undefined or not defined. If it is so then let us define it. We already know that 4 / 0 should give us a finite number. 0 / 4 means we are dividing the numerator 0 with the denominator 4. Zero means nothing. Dividing 0 with 4 means dividing nothing into 4 parts, it means we are not dividing anything. Therefore 0 in the numerator means we have nothing to divide. What does 4 in the denominator mean? 4 in the denominator means we are dividing the numerator into 4 parts that is we are converting the numerator into 4 parts. Now that we know what denominator means we will discuss 4 / 0. 0 in the denominator means dividing the numerator that is 4 into zero parts. Mind you, 0 in the denominator does not mean we are not dividing. Zero in the denominator actually means we are converting the numerator into zero parts. If we can divide the numerator into zero parts then each part is equal to zero. But sum of zeroes does not give us 4. Therefore 4 can not be divided by 0. In fact numerator can not be divided by 0. Therefore 0 can not exist as denominator. It is true that the numerator can not be divided into zero parts and it is also true that sum of zeroes does not give anything but zero. Therefore 1. Zero can not exist as denominator. The fact that the numerator can not be divided into zero parts means anything that exists can not be destroyed into nothingness. And the fact that sum of zeroes gives us zero alone means anything that does not exist can not be given existence out of nothingness. Therefore 2. Anything can not be created out of nothingness, only change of form is possible and change is everywhere. 3. Anything can not be destroyed into nothingness, only change of form is possible and change is everywhere. Once again we need to know what infinite means. What does infinite mean? Infinite means not finite and not finite means unlimited. By now we know that creation and destruction are impossible. If creation is impossible then there is no other way new things can add up to the World that already exists. If new things can not add up to the World then there is no way anything that exists in this World can be infinite. Therefore 4. Existence of anything can not be infinite. Numbers are infinite but number of apples ( existence ) can not be infinite. Now, we know that creation and destruction are impossible and we also know that the existence of anything can not be infinite. We are part of the world we live in. In our world existence of anything can not be infinite. That is Space, Mass, Energy, Density, Gravity, Force,... etc; can not be infinite. Also, in our World creation and destruction are impossible. Creation is impossible means no new things can add up to the World that already exists and it also means what already exists can not come out of creation. Creation is impossible, creation is completely ruled out. We also know that destruction of the World is impossible. Therefore 5. There is no beginning and an end to the existence of the World. We know what an equation means. An equation is a law of equity. If creation and destruction are possible then all laws have to fail. In a World where creation and destruction are possible laws can not exist, only Chaos exists. Therefore 6. There are finite absolute laws. E = M C2 has another side to it. E stands for the energy of the electromagnetic radiation, M is the intrinsic mass of the electromagnetic radiation and C is the velocity of the electromagnetic radiation. Any ordinary body can be moved and therefore its velocity is relative at constant gravity. Electromagnetic radiation travels on its own, it can not be moved like any ordinary body by moving the source of the electromagnetic radiation. Therefore velocity of electromagnetic radiation is observed to be constant at constant gravity. When there is considerable change in gravity there is change in velocity of the electromagnetic radiation. Therefore velocity of electromagnetic radiation is relative to change in gravity. E = M C2 F = M g E = ( F/g ) C2 7. Velocity of anything is relative. Everything is well defined in three dimensions. Space too is three dimensional. String Theory claims more than three dimensions. Time is an imaginary dimension. Existence of anything short of three dimensions is impossible since anything that exists can not be destroyed into nothingness. If more than three dimensions can exist, they have to exist everywhere and always. Since anything can not be created out of nothingness more than three dimensions can not be given existence out of nothingness. Therefore String Theory can not be true. 8. There are three dimensions and three dimensions only. Therefore anything short of three dimensions and more than three dimensions is impossible. Time is an imaginary dimension. Time Travel is impossible since Time is an imaginary dimension. 9. Time Travel can not exist. There are no infinite parallel Worlds with infinite parallel changes and we can not Time Travel. Time Travel is meaningless.

There is a fourth dimension to space and that is the fabric of space or what we perceive as gravity. Gravity appears when matter is inserted into space creating a rent. Gravity of space then resists and pushes back to close the rent and in doing so pushes matter together. Space is continually forcing matter together to reach a state of equilibrium of a space without matter. Gravity is not a force of matter; it is a force of space itself and only appears when matter is intruding into space. Gravity waves will remain undiscovered, as they do not exist unless you think of space as one giant gravity wave. Gravity is a force against matter that opposes its intrusion into space. . This gravity force of space is a weak force but enough to retard the speed of light and keep it constant along with radio wave propagation. .",

As an artist, I try to teach people to get more depth in their two dimensional art by the use of some serious chiaroscuro and contrast. People tend to want to represent things too flatly... not that it's either here or there regarding the Mobius.", 
        "reply": " Really? Ever do a study of Pamala Lee Anderson? I defy you to do one that's two dimensional! OK! Granted, personality-wise, she's somewhat less than single-dimensional, but you'd be hard-pressed to sketch that for anyone! Sorry! The director's cut of \"Barb Wire\" has been on a few times lately in High-def and I couldn't resist! It is not our belief or disbelief that can make or unmake the fact. ~ Thomas Paine",

Thanx. :-) A person could keep a poster of her in a locker, but if I were selecting a model for a nude rendering I'd more likely find someone with more natural attributes. Usually, people avoid buying and hanging over-endowed artwork unless their presentation is intentionally kitschy. I have known models who were naturally endowed that way, but even they become suspect. How's that for pondering a chain of thought?",
