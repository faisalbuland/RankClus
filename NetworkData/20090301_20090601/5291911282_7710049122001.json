        "content": "Today I went down to the local Hunting/Fishing License bureau and renewed my Hunting and Fishing License. I put in for a couple of hunts that might be fruitful. I will be hunting with my friend in La Pine and his Father Who is from Bend. It was a cold season last year and I can verify that my water tube froze on my backpack while out trying to surprise the \"Ghost of the woods\" the Great Northwest Elk. Yeah right like I'm gonna sneak up on one of them. But the experience is still the same and I enjoy getting out in the woods and beating myself to death on the hills and mountains and rocks and thistles... Why am I doing this again? Oh well here is a survey in the spirit of the last one with a bit of humor. Question: Do you Hunt and/or Fish and spend a lot doing it? Choices: Never, I'm scared of Guns and fishing is just too icky! $0.00 COST. Only the opposite sex, I hunt in the regular places and use a sexy clothes and fancy lines to draw in the game, The fatal blow is when I blink my eyelashes. I get my honey for nuthin and my drinks for free. I hunt for bargains all the time. It's Garage Sale season! and fish for a better price on all purchases, WHAT! You want how much for that? I'm gonna HAVE A HEART ATTACK! I'm from the MacSpendless Clan, we never pay full price! Been hunting and fishing a few times always came home tired muddy and without what I went out for in the first place, How much did I spend? Do I count the cost of calamine, laundry detergent and embarrassment? I Spend as much hunting and fishing as I would spend just buying the doggone game outright... In a fancy NewYork Restaurant WITH CHEF PIERRE COOKIN! Somebody Help ME! My credit cards are maxxed! I never spend more than what it costs to pick up the game from the center line and carve it into unrecognizable peices and smoke it so's the gaminess of the asphalt doesn't come through in the meat. Fishin? Dyno-mite iz muh fren. I hunt and fish all the time and am never seen by the others doing the same. I sit amused in my secluded spot and watch the comedy of the season, whichever it may be. My game or fish are usually driven to me by the other's antics. I spend little money Question: Do you buy Special stamps or tags? Choices: The only \"Special Stamps and Tags\" I get are in the Nightclubs. I hear Disco is coming back. I get'em but I rarely use'em, Just let me stick to the riverbank and catch them slow fish. The only time I've ever needed one it was too late and the game officer was already there. But, but OFFICER! Special Stamps and Tags! he11, I don't even buy the license. Season? What are you talking about? I have a great \"Camo\" paint job on my custom 4X4 CADILLAC! LOQUITA! Get me a BEER and A'll take yall down to Wal-Mart, gotta get me s'more apple chips fe I have a short attention span and don't even remember what I did last week. Stamp what? Are you gonna smoke that thing or what? What were we talking about? I buy the stamps but usually wind up in the wrong area anyway. Game Officers don't understand when you go in the wrong direction. Yes Sir, I was on the west side of that rock and downstream from the bridge and yes I was in the south side of the stream If I wear my guille suit and stay low I can shoot, gut and skin my deer and never stand up. Low crawl to the pickup with my game and drive out of the woods in a subdued SUV. I AM A GOD in the woods! Question: Do you prefer bow hunting or rifle hunting? Choices: Bow seems a little primative, give me a Thompson any day, Did I menthion I'm an Full Auto Hunter? AK-47 works well for Skqwerel. The gun doesn't snap back at you like a bow, I still have bruises from trying to keep the bow from slapping my wrist and crippling my hand. I'm gonna give this thing to my BIL. Silent and deadly slinking through the woods me and arrow, flat out and narrow. I'm RAMBO slippin and slidin through the woods. I have cookies in my knapsack and a yoohoo in my pocket. I prefer a 105mm but I can't get one at the local gun-mart. I hear there's a guy in El Paso who will give me one with the purchase of a dozen night goggles. Give me a compound and I'll come home with dinner. Does anybody have a possum recipe? Question: Do you have special hunting/fishing buddies? Choices: I have a special Hunting and Fishing buddy and if my Wife ever finds out I'm in big trouble. The upside is my fishing buddy, she wears the same lipstick as my wife. Yeah and he won't shut up. Who says you have to be nice to your Brother in Law. I have a few that think their special. I just never let them plan any hunting/fishing trips and I can be sure they go off without a hitch. I have a few that are challenged. That's special ain't it. One of them is equiliberally challenged and I rarely take him out in a canoe. The other is common sense challenged, I always let him take point on the hunt. Are you kidding? Take someone else with me when I'm going to be working with sharp knives and powerful weapons? I don't know anybody I trust that much. No thx, I'll just do all my hunting and fishing on my own. Question: Do you use a GPS unit? Choices: Charlie don't surf and GPS don't hunt. Naw I don't need no steenkeen GPS. Is that a new bait? I'll try anything. Is it waterproof? Is that the new Pontiac? Yeah, I've gotten my last few deer with one and never had to leave the truck. Always to my advantage, particularly useful when I find lost hunters and fishermen and convincing them what is the best direction to go. Question: What is the Biggest game you ever bagged? Choices: A poker game in Cleveland. A 2 0z. fur-bearing white mouse, in a Victor device. 10 pd. Possum with a 55 chevrolet Bel-air and One Buck Deer with the windshield of my F-150. A fair sized deer either mule or white tail or any other combination of deer with or without horns in daylight or at night with a 1,000,000 CP spot. Brand new Pickup truck (After the retriever fetched the dyno-mite and then jumped into the Pickup truck). My Mother-in-law. But don't tell anyone, the police are still looking for her. Question: What kind of tackle do you use? Choices: What ever worked for Refrigerator Perry works for me. I buy all my gear online and from the sport fishing channel. I lose all my gear the same old fashioned way on log, rocks, unidentified submerged objects... Time to call the History Channel. I only buy my gear when it's on sale, 50% or less or I'm not buying it. It disappears just the same as the guy 's who spends a fortune on stuff that will just get lost anyway. I make all my own tackle, I melt and pour all of my own sinkers and weights. I tie all of my own fly's and carve all of my plugs from raw stock wood. I am the consumate mountain man. Honey get me a beer would ya? Whatever I can find in my BIL's tackle box. I ain't spendin money on this stuff. Besides he's the one with the government job. Question: What is the Biggest fish you ever caught? Choices: Poly-Wogs in the ditch next to the trailer park. My Goldfish A 10 lb. Salmon at the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle Washington. My BIL's Oscar when he was moving to their new Apartment. I swear I'm gonna drop that fish in the toilet if they ever move again. A 25 Pound Salmon on the Kenai river in Alaska. Took ten minutes to land it and three seconds to abandon it, when the griz came in and claimed my fish. Took a while to find my guide as he ran off screaming when the bear materialized. Wheres my BIL now Question: Do you take the spouse fishing/hunting? Choices: I did till she started catching/shooting more and I wuz losing money on the First, Biggest, Most bets. Who knew a Woman could hit a running rabbit at a hundred yards? No, he just keeps forgetting his gear and won't sit still long enough. It's enough that I have to babysit him during the week as well. I did until we had to go to the ER to remove the hook. I was off a little on my cast and... OH well... It took a while to get things back to normal. Getting the stitches out was a turning point. I can buy tackle again but I have to keep the tackle bo Not anymore. I had to keep running one season until she unloaded the magazine on what she though was a deer. I managed to stay ahead of the barrage of 243 Winchester rounds that I had lovingly purchased for my beloved at the local gun-mart. Still not s No I've heard some horror stories regarding that practice. I will have to keep that one in the box so to speak. Question: Did you mean? Choices: All of the above except the last three. None of the last answers but most of the first ones. Every other question and most of the odd ones. One two and three but not four and five. What kind of answers are these? The majority was right on that last survey you are nutz! :) \u00a0 Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",

Isn't it funny the people who live in the urban culture always see the fast paced big city folk as a threat. Remember the thread about Texans and New Yorkers?

        "content": "Today I went down to the local Hunting/Fishing License bureau and renewed my Hunting and Fishing License. I put in for a couple of hunts that might be fruitful. I will be hunting with my friend in La Pine and his Father Who is from Bend. It was a cold season last year and I can verify that my water tube froze on my backpack while out trying to surprise the \"Ghost of the woods\" the Great Northwest Elk. Yeah right like I'm gonna sneak up on one of them. But the experience is still the same and I enjoy getting out in the woods and beating myself to death on the hills and mountains and rocks and thistles... Why am I doing this again? Oh well here is a survey in the spirit of the last one with a bit of humor. Question: Do you Hunt and/or Fish and spend a lot doing it? Choices: Never, I'm scared of Guns and fishing is just too icky! $0.00 COST. Only the opposite sex, I hunt in the regular places and use a sexy clothes and fancy lines to draw in the game, The fatal blow is when I blink my eyelashes. I get my honey for nuthin and my drinks for free. I hunt for bargains all the time. It's Garage Sale season! and fish for a better price on all purchases, WHAT! You want how much for that? I'm gonna HAVE A HEART ATTACK! I'm from the MacSpendless Clan, we never pay full price! Been hunting and fishing a few times always came home tired muddy and without what I went out for in the first place, How much did I spend? Do I count the cost of calamine, laundry detergent and embarrassment? I Spend as much hunting and fishing as I would spend just buying the doggone game outright... In a fancy NewYork Restaurant WITH CHEF PIERRE COOKIN! Somebody Help ME! My credit cards are maxxed! I never spend more than what it costs to pick up the game from the center line and carve it into unrecognizable peices and smoke it so's the gaminess of the asphalt doesn't come through in the meat. Fishin? Dyno-mite iz muh fren. I hunt and fish all the time and am never seen by the others doing the same. I sit amused in my secluded spot and watch the comedy of the season, whichever it may be. My game or fish are usually driven to me by the other's antics. I spend little money Question: Do you buy Special stamps or tags? Choices: The only \"Special Stamps and Tags\" I get are in the Nightclubs. I hear Disco is coming back. I get'em but I rarely use'em, Just let me stick to the riverbank and catch them slow fish. The only time I've ever needed one it was too late and the game officer was already there. But, but OFFICER! Special Stamps and Tags! he11, I don't even buy the license. Season? What are you talking about? I have a great \"Camo\" paint job on my custom 4X4 CADILLAC! LOQUITA! Get me a BEER and A'll take yall down to Wal-Mart, gotta get me s'more apple chips fe I have a short attention span and don't even remember what I did last week. Stamp what? Are you gonna smoke that thing or what? What were we talking about? I buy the stamps but usually wind up in the wrong area anyway. Game Officers don't understand when you go in the wrong direction. Yes Sir, I was on the west side of that rock and downstream from the bridge and yes I was in the south side of the stream If I wear my guille suit and stay low I can shoot, gut and skin my deer and never stand up. Low crawl to the pickup with my game and drive out of the woods in a subdued SUV. I AM A GOD in the woods! Question: Do you prefer bow hunting or rifle hunting? Choices: Bow seems a little primative, give me a Thompson any day, Did I menthion I'm an Full Auto Hunter? AK-47 works well for Skqwerel. The gun doesn't snap back at you like a bow, I still have bruises from trying to keep the bow from slapping my wrist and crippling my hand. I'm gonna give this thing to my BIL. Silent and deadly slinking through the woods me and arrow, flat out and narrow. I'm RAMBO slippin and slidin through the woods. I have cookies in my knapsack and a yoohoo in my pocket. I prefer a 105mm but I can't get one at the local gun-mart. I hear there's a guy in El Paso who will give me one with the purchase of a dozen night goggles. Give me a compound and I'll come home with dinner. Does anybody have a possum recipe? Question: Do you have special hunting/fishing buddies? Choices: I have a special Hunting and Fishing buddy and if my Wife ever finds out I'm in big trouble. The upside is my fishing buddy, she wears the same lipstick as my wife. Yeah and he won't shut up. Who says you have to be nice to your Brother in Law. I have a few that think their special. I just never let them plan any hunting/fishing trips and I can be sure they go off without a hitch. I have a few that are challenged. That's special ain't it. One of them is equiliberally challenged and I rarely take him out in a canoe. The other is common sense challenged, I always let him take point on the hunt. Are you kidding? Take someone else with me when I'm going to be working with sharp knives and powerful weapons? I don't know anybody I trust that much. No thx, I'll just do all my hunting and fishing on my own. Question: Do you use a GPS unit? Choices: Charlie don't surf and GPS don't hunt. Naw I don't need no steenkeen GPS. Is that a new bait? I'll try anything. Is it waterproof? Is that the new Pontiac? Yeah, I've gotten my last few deer with one and never had to leave the truck. Always to my advantage, particularly useful when I find lost hunters and fishermen and convincing them what is the best direction to go. Question: What is the Biggest game you ever bagged? Choices: A poker game in Cleveland. A 2 0z. fur-bearing white mouse, in a Victor device. 10 pd. Possum with a 55 chevrolet Bel-air and One Buck Deer with the windshield of my F-150. A fair sized deer either mule or white tail or any other combination of deer with or without horns in daylight or at night with a 1,000,000 CP spot. Brand new Pickup truck (After the retriever fetched the dyno-mite and then jumped into the Pickup truck). My Mother-in-law. But don't tell anyone, the police are still looking for her. Question: What kind of tackle do you use? Choices: What ever worked for Refrigerator Perry works for me. I buy all my gear online and from the sport fishing channel. I lose all my gear the same old fashioned way on log, rocks, unidentified submerged objects... Time to call the History Channel. I only buy my gear when it's on sale, 50% or less or I'm not buying it. It disappears just the same as the guy 's who spends a fortune on stuff that will just get lost anyway. I make all my own tackle, I melt and pour all of my own sinkers and weights. I tie all of my own fly's and carve all of my plugs from raw stock wood. I am the consumate mountain man. Honey get me a beer would ya? Whatever I can find in my BIL's tackle box. I ain't spendin money on this stuff. Besides he's the one with the government job. Question: What is the Biggest fish you ever caught? Choices: Poly-Wogs in the ditch next to the trailer park. My Goldfish A 10 lb. Salmon at the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle Washington. My BIL's Oscar when he was moving to their new Apartment. I swear I'm gonna drop that fish in the toilet if they ever move again. A 25 Pound Salmon on the Kenai river in Alaska. Took ten minutes to land it and three seconds to abandon it, when the griz came in and claimed my fish. Took a while to find my guide as he ran off screaming when the bear materialized. Wheres my BIL now Question: Do you take the spouse fishing/hunting? Choices: I did till she started catching/shooting more and I wuz losing money on the First, Biggest, Most bets. Who knew a Woman could hit a running rabbit at a hundred yards? No, he just keeps forgetting his gear and won't sit still long enough. It's enough that I have to babysit him during the week as well. I did until we had to go to the ER to remove the hook. I was off a little on my cast and... OH well... It took a while to get things back to normal. Getting the stitches out was a turning point. I can buy tackle again but I have to keep the tackle bo Not anymore. I had to keep running one season until she unloaded the magazine on what she though was a deer. I managed to stay ahead of the barrage of 243 Winchester rounds that I had lovingly purchased for my beloved at the local gun-mart. Still not s No I've heard some horror stories regarding that practice. I will have to keep that one in the box so to speak. Question: Did you mean? Choices: All of the above except the last three. None of the last answers but most of the first ones. Every other question and most of the odd ones. One two and three but not four and five. What kind of answers are these? The majority was right on that last survey you are nutz! :) \u00a0 Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",

Low crawl to the pickup with my game and drive out of the woods in a subdued SUV. I AM A GOD in the woods! Question: Do you prefer bow hunting or rifle hunting? Choices: Bow seems a little primative, give me a Thompson any day, Did I menthion I'm an Full Auto Hunter? AK-47 works well for Skqwerel. The gun doesn't snap back at you like a bow, I still have bruises from trying to keep the bow from slapping my wrist and crippling my hand. I'm gonna give this thing to my BIL. Silent and deadly slinking through the woods me and arrow, flat out and narrow. I'm RAMBO slippin and slidin through the woods. I have cookies in my knapsack and a yoohoo in my pocket. I prefer a 105mm but I can't get one at the local gun-mart. I hear there's a guy in El Paso who will give me one with the purchase of a dozen night goggles. Give me a compound and I'll come home with dinner. Does anybody have a possum recipe? Question: Do you have special hunting/fishing buddies? Choices: I have a special Hunting and Fishing buddy and if my Wife ever finds out I'm in big trouble. The upside is my fishing buddy, she wears the same lipstick as my wife. Yeah and he won't shut up. Who says you have to be nice to your Brother in Law. I have a few that think their special. I just never let them plan any hunting/fishing trips and I can be sure they go off without a hitch. I have a few that are challenged. That's special ain't it. One of them is equiliberally challenged and I rarely take him out in a canoe. The other is common sense challenged, I always let him take point on the hunt. Are you kidding? Take someone else with me when I'm going to be working with sharp knives and powerful weapons? I don't know anybody I trust that much. No thx, I'll just do all my hunting and fishing on my own. Question: Do you use a GPS unit? Choices: Charlie don't surf and GPS don't hunt. Naw I don't need no steenkeen GPS. Is that a new bait? I'll try anything. Is it waterproof? Is that the new Pontiac? Yeah, I've gotten my last few deer with one and never had to leave the truck. Always to my advantage, particularly useful when I find lost hunters and fishermen and convincing them what is the best direction to go. Question: What is the Biggest game you ever bagged? Choices: A poker game in Cleveland. A 2 0z. fur-bearing white mouse, in a Victor device. 10 pd. Possum with a 55 chevrolet Bel-air and One Buck Deer with the windshield of my F-150. A fair sized deer either mule or white tail or any other combination of deer with or without horns in daylight or at night with a 1,000,000 CP spot. Brand new Pickup truck (After the retriever fetched the dyno-mite and then jumped into the Pickup truck). My Mother-in-law. But don't tell anyone, the police are still looking for her. Question: What kind of tackle do you use? Choices: What ever worked for Refrigerator Perry works for me. I buy all my gear online and from the sport fishing channel. I lose all my gear the same old fashioned way on log, rocks, unidentified submerged objects... Time to call the History Channel. I only buy my gear when it's on sale, 50% or less or I'm not buying it. It disappears just the same as the guy 's who spends a fortune on stuff that will just get lost anyway. I make all my own tackle, I melt and pour all of my own sinkers and weights. I tie all of my own fly's and carve all of my plugs from raw stock wood. I am the consumate mountain man. Honey get me a beer would ya? Whatever I can find in my BIL's tackle box. I ain't spendin money on this stuff. Besides he's the one with the government job. Question: What is the Biggest fish you ever caught? Choices: Poly-Wogs in the ditch next to the trailer park. My Goldfish A 10 lb. Salmon at the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle Washington. My BIL's Oscar when he was moving to their new Apartment. I swear I'm gonna drop that fish in the toilet if they ever move again. A 25 Pound Salmon on the Kenai river in Alaska. Took ten minutes to land it and three seconds to abandon it, when the griz came in and claimed my fish. Took a while to find my guide as he ran off screaming when the bear materialized. Wheres my BIL now Question: Do you take the spouse fishing/hunting? Choices: I did till she started catching/shooting more and I wuz losing money on the First, Biggest, Most bets. Who knew a Woman could hit a running rabbit at a hundred yards? No, he just keeps forgetting his gear and won't sit still long enough. It's enough that I have to babysit him during the week as well. I did until we had to go to the ER to remove the hook. I was off a little on my cast and... OH well... It took a while to get things back to normal. Getting the stitches out was a turning point. I can buy tackle again but I have to keep the tackle bo Not anymore. I had to keep running one season until she unloaded the magazine on what she though was a deer. I managed to stay ahead of the barrage of 243 Winchester rounds that I had lovingly purchased for my beloved at the local gun-mart. Still not s No I've heard some horror stories regarding that practice. I will have to keep that one in the box so to speak. Question: Did you mean? Choices: All of the above except the last three. None of the last answers but most of the first ones. Every other question and most of the odd ones. One two and three but not four and five. What kind of answers are these? The majority was right on that last survey you are nutz! :) \u00a0 Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",

        "content": "Today I went down to the local Hunting/Fishing License bureau and renewed my Hunting and Fishing License. I put in for a couple of hunts that might be fruitful. I will be hunting with my friend in La Pine and his Father Who is from Bend. It was a cold season last year and I can verify that my water tube froze on my backpack while out trying to surprise the \"Ghost of the woods\" the Great Northwest Elk. Yeah right like I'm gonna sneak up on one of them. But the experience is still the same and I enjoy getting out in the woods and beating myself to death on the hills and mountains and rocks and thistles... Why am I doing this again? Oh well here is a survey in the spirit of the last one with a bit of humor. Question: Do you Hunt and/or Fish and spend a lot doing it? Choices: Never, I'm scared of Guns and fishing is just too icky! $0.00 COST. Only the opposite sex, I hunt in the regular places and use a sexy clothes and fancy lines to draw in the game, The fatal blow is when I blink my eyelashes. I get my honey for nuthin and my drinks for free. I hunt for bargains all the time. It's Garage Sale season! and fish for a better price on all purchases, WHAT! You want how much for that? I'm gonna HAVE A HEART ATTACK! I'm from the MacSpendless Clan, we never pay full price! Been hunting and fishing a few times always came home tired muddy and without what I went out for in the first place, How much did I spend? Do I count the cost of calamine, laundry detergent and embarrassment? I Spend as much hunting and fishing as I would spend just buying the doggone game outright... In a fancy NewYork Restaurant WITH CHEF PIERRE COOKIN! Somebody Help ME! My credit cards are maxxed! I never spend more than what it costs to pick up the game from the center line and carve it into unrecognizable peices and smoke it so's the gaminess of the asphalt doesn't come through in the meat. Fishin? Dyno-mite iz muh fren. I hunt and fish all the time and am never seen by the others doing the same. I sit amused in my secluded spot and watch the comedy of the season, whichever it may be. My game or fish are usually driven to me by the other's antics. I spend little money Question: Do you buy Special stamps or tags? Choices: The only \"Special Stamps and Tags\" I get are in the Nightclubs. I hear Disco is coming back. I get'em but I rarely use'em, Just let me stick to the riverbank and catch them slow fish. The only time I've ever needed one it was too late and the game officer was already there. But, but OFFICER! Special Stamps and Tags! he11, I don't even buy the license. Season? What are you talking about? I have a great \"Camo\" paint job on my custom 4X4 CADILLAC! LOQUITA! Get me a BEER and A'll take yall down to Wal-Mart, gotta get me s'more apple chips fe I have a short attention span and don't even remember what I did last week. Stamp what? Are you gonna smoke that thing or what? What were we talking about? I buy the stamps but usually wind up in the wrong area anyway. Game Officers don't understand when you go in the wrong direction. Yes Sir, I was on the west side of that rock and downstream from the bridge and yes I was in the south side of the stream If I wear my guille suit and stay low I can shoot, gut and skin my deer and never stand up. Low crawl to the pickup with my game and drive out of the woods in a subdued SUV. I AM A GOD in the woods! Question: Do you prefer bow hunting or rifle hunting? Choices: Bow seems a little primative, give me a Thompson any day, Did I menthion I'm an Full Auto Hunter? AK-47 works well for Skqwerel. The gun doesn't snap back at you like a bow, I still have bruises from trying to keep the bow from slapping my wrist and crippling my hand. I'm gonna give this thing to my BIL. Silent and deadly slinking through the woods me and arrow, flat out and narrow. I'm RAMBO slippin and slidin through the woods. I have cookies in my knapsack and a yoohoo in my pocket. I prefer a 105mm but I can't get one at the local gun-mart. I hear there's a guy in El Paso who will give me one with the purchase of a dozen night goggles. Give me a compound and I'll come home with dinner. Does anybody have a possum recipe? Question: Do you have special hunting/fishing buddies? Choices: I have a special Hunting and Fishing buddy and if my Wife ever finds out I'm in big trouble. The upside is my fishing buddy, she wears the same lipstick as my wife. Yeah and he won't shut up. Who says you have to be nice to your Brother in Law. I have a few that think their special. I just never let them plan any hunting/fishing trips and I can be sure they go off without a hitch. I have a few that are challenged. That's special ain't it. One of them is equiliberally challenged and I rarely take him out in a canoe. The other is common sense challenged, I always let him take point on the hunt. Are you kidding? Take someone else with me when I'm going to be working with sharp knives and powerful weapons? I don't know anybody I trust that much. No thx, I'll just do all my hunting and fishing on my own. Question: Do you use a GPS unit? Choices: Charlie don't surf and GPS don't hunt. Naw I don't need no steenkeen GPS. Is that a new bait? I'll try anything. Is it waterproof? Is that the new Pontiac? Yeah, I've gotten my last few deer with one and never had to leave the truck. Always to my advantage, particularly useful when I find lost hunters and fishermen and convincing them what is the best direction to go. Question: What is the Biggest game you ever bagged? Choices: A poker game in Cleveland. A 2 0z. fur-bearing white mouse, in a Victor device. 10 pd. Possum with a 55 chevrolet Bel-air and One Buck Deer with the windshield of my F-150. A fair sized deer either mule or white tail or any other combination of deer with or without horns in daylight or at night with a 1,000,000 CP spot. Brand new Pickup truck (After the retriever fetched the dyno-mite and then jumped into the Pickup truck). My Mother-in-law. But don't tell anyone, the police are still looking for her. Question: What kind of tackle do you use? Choices: What ever worked for Refrigerator Perry works for me. I buy all my gear online and from the sport fishing channel. I lose all my gear the same old fashioned way on log, rocks, unidentified submerged objects... Time to call the History Channel. I only buy my gear when it's on sale, 50% or less or I'm not buying it. It disappears just the same as the guy 's who spends a fortune on stuff that will just get lost anyway. I make all my own tackle, I melt and pour all of my own sinkers and weights. I tie all of my own fly's and carve all of my plugs from raw stock wood. I am the consumate mountain man. Honey get me a beer would ya? Whatever I can find in my BIL's tackle box. I ain't spendin money on this stuff. Besides he's the one with the government job. Question: What is the Biggest fish you ever caught? Choices: Poly-Wogs in the ditch next to the trailer park. My Goldfish A 10 lb. Salmon at the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle Washington. My BIL's Oscar when he was moving to their new Apartment. I swear I'm gonna drop that fish in the toilet if they ever move again. A 25 Pound Salmon on the Kenai river in Alaska. Took ten minutes to land it and three seconds to abandon it, when the griz came in and claimed my fish. Took a while to find my guide as he ran off screaming when the bear materialized. Wheres my BIL now Question: Do you take the spouse fishing/hunting? Choices: I did till she started catching/shooting more and I wuz losing money on the First, Biggest, Most bets. Who knew a Woman could hit a running rabbit at a hundred yards? No, he just keeps forgetting his gear and won't sit still long enough. It's enough that I have to babysit him during the week as well. I did until we had to go to the ER to remove the hook. I was off a little on my cast and... OH well... It took a while to get things back to normal. Getting the stitches out was a turning point. I can buy tackle again but I have to keep the tackle bo Not anymore. I had to keep running one season until she unloaded the magazine on what she though was a deer. I managed to stay ahead of the barrage of 243 Winchester rounds that I had lovingly purchased for my beloved at the local gun-mart. Still not s No I've heard some horror stories regarding that practice. I will have to keep that one in the box so to speak. Question: Did you mean? Choices: All of the above except the last three. None of the last answers but most of the first ones. Every other question and most of the odd ones. One two and three but not four and five. What kind of answers are these? The majority was right on that last survey you are nutz! :) \u00a0 Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
