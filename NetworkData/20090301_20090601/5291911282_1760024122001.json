I am currently enrolled in college, and my GI Bill expired in 2003. Do what I do and use your grants and federal student aid to pay for your classes. The VA does offer you a bit of help - I think I got a $700 grant for this year from them. It doesn't sound like much, but every little bit helps. Speaking only for myself, I did not serve to earn free college money. I love this nation, and I love all who choose to serve this nation. Being upset over an expired GI Bill just isn't worthy of my consideration... though I admit that I wish I still had the benefit to fall back on. If you truly want your education, do whatever it takes to get it. I assure you, it is rewarding! I love college (I attend online) and I have enough research under my belt to know where I can expect my MA to take me. Trust me, my friend - it is worth all the effort! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",

I had no idea. That is GREAT! The cost of school is outrageous these days, and our vets deserve all the breaks we can give them. My tuition is like $335 a credit hour, and once I am in my MA program that will jump to over $450/CH. I don't regret a single second of my 8-year enlistment, but it sure would have been nice to learn a trade and a skillset other than pulling a trigger - which doesn't equate to too many jobs in demand in the civilian sector.
