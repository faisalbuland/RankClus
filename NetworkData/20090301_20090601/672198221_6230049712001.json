WEST POINT, NY \u2013 A courageous group of America\u2019s best and brightest are once again answering their call to duty, honor, and country: by coming out of the closet. \u201cKnights Out,\u201d an association of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) West Point Alumni and their supporters emerged from anonymity today to support thousands of LGBT Soldiers currently serving in the armed forces, and to educate the current military leadership on the importance of accepting and honoring the sacrifices and selfless service of their LGBT soldiers and officers. As congress approaches the decision to allow LGBT military personnel to serve openly, the group is prepared to serve as a critical support and advocacy group for the full acceptance of gay service members, particularly at West Point. By publicly outing themselves, the 37 members of Knights Out ended once and for all the anonymity that has obscured from full view their service to the nation as West Point graduates. Knights Out seeks to reduce the stigma associated with sexual diversity by providing an open forum for discussion between out LGBT West Point graduates and their fellow alumni. Knights Out is well-positioned to help West Point maintain its status as the world\u2019s premier leadership institution by swiftly and effectively adapting to the end of the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy, which Knights Out believes is both imminent and inevitable. Colonel (Retired) Stewart Bornhoft, West Point class of 1969 and Vietnam combat veteran, welcomed the formation of Knights Out: \u201cAll West Pointers, regardless of their own sexual orientation, will soon be charged with leading soldiers who freely acknowledge their diverse orientations. Just as we set the example for the successful integration of the races and genders, we will have that same responsibility when our nation joins the family of 26 other militaries that have implemented the freedom to serve openly. When open service is enacted, the words of the Cadet Prayer - \u2018\u2026never to be content with a half truth when the whole truth can be won\u2019 \u2013 will once again be our guidepost.\u201d On the 207th anniversary of the founding of West Point, it is fitting that Knights Out brings over 275 combined years of Active Duty service of their LGBT members to assist West Point and the AOG. The organization takes its name after West Point\u2019s mascot, the Black Knight, a selfless warrior whose identity must be hidden but emerges to save the day nonetheless. Knights Out is led by a board of LGBT West Point graduates and their supporters. The group includes combat veterans and leaders in their local communities. All are also members of the Service Academy Gay and Lesbian Alumni (SAGALA) network, with over 340 members, a number which includes some Active Duty combat commanders currently in Iraq and Afghanistan. SAGALA protects member identities because of the current discriminatory policy. Under the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" law, gay and lesbian service members are allowed to serve in the United States armed forces, but are not permitted to tell coworkers their sexual orientation, living a secret life in exchange for the opportunity to serve. Because West Point cadets live by the Honor Code, that they \u201cwill not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do,\u201d LGBT cadets and graduates are frequently forced to compromise their integrity. This policy undermines the Army Values of Honor, Integrity, and Respect, resulting in the premature resignation of many talented service members and West Point graduates.",

What purpose does it serve to degrade and humiliate them with threats of kicking them out if someone finds out or restricting their service in any manner beyond what is expected of a service member..... integrity on the job is far more important than sexual orientation. There is no serious \"historical\" reasons to demean and degrade these capable and willing citizens from serving and defending the Constitution like anyone else who is eligible. As far as morals go. If you are basing it on \"traditional\" Judaic/Christian morals, which is more immoral? Adultery between consent heterosexuals in the military or being a homosexual? If we had to stop immoral people from being in the military, we have to get rid of a large percentage of those who disregard \"traditional historical\" morality. I spent too many years in Army Family Advocacy to believe homosexuals are a greater 'immoral' threat than out-of-control heterosexuals.

Yes, those antiquated old, arthritic views of morality and decency mean nothing. People of today are oh-so much smarter and knowledgeable, sho' 'nuff. You want to proclaim the merits of perversion? Hey, have at it; this is America, not an islamic nation, so you won't be beheaded or stoned. But never expect that such contemptible behavior will be publicly accepted when those guilty of it drag their filth into the public arena claiming its acceptability or nobility, when others of us understand the underlying psychological insecurities that lead to such behavior.",

They just want to serve in the military without regard to their sexual preference - as people serve without regard to their religion, gender, ethnicity or race.
