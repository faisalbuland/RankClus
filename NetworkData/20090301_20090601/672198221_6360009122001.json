Texas is the Third largest reciepient of all the States. Only California and New York recieve more. Should they get more aid? Maybe. On a per Capita basis that are near the bottom when it comes to aid. But then again, Texas just turned down 550 million dollars. Perry said he didn't like aid with strings attached. Whatever that means... Even so, I wonder why anyone in America would support simply shoveling the money at Texas with no guaranttee on how it's going to be spent. Dave",
