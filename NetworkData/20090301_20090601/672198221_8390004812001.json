I cannot recall during combat ever thinking about the details of the war in Vietnam, the politics of the conflict, the bantering back and forth between the many politicians involved, the socio-economic implications...I thought about my obligations at those times of doing what I promised to do...aid, defend, protect, kill or be killed if required, don't make a stupid mistake but to make sure I did all in my power to protect my fellow Marines. I have never looked at my service as a political comment in order to justify my service. And many of my fellow Marines whom I had the honor to serve with feel the same way. The sacrificing of more lives in order to believe it is an obligation to be fulfilled because ignorant politicians make assnine decisions to continue a fight that derives no benefit to America and its position in the world is specious at best and an insult to those who don a uniform of our Armed Forces. It is an attitude and belief that has led many in history down the road of regret after realizing sacrificing more lives to justify the deaths of those who died earlier would somehow change the equation, change the results and somehow change relevant and legitimate evidence. It never has and never will. The decision to go to war had better be made after all evidence has been studied and assurance of victory is predicated upon realistic appraisels of all information available and not pie in the sky manipulated intel. If Iraq and Afghanistan has proven anything, it is our political and military inability to be honest with ourselves. Even a novice could have evaluated the data available pertaining to both countries to realize involvement in a ground war in either country would be an effort in futility. In my life's experiences, if something is good then people will want it...some will want it so badly they will take it, steal it. If something is perceived to be good, one does not need to provide it at the end of the barrel of a gun or with bombs. No recipient of a good thing wants it delivered from an aircraft at 30,000 feet...smart bomb, dumb bomb makes no difference. If America is intent upon exporting democracy worldwide, we had better come up with a better way of accomplishing such a goal than our current set of tactics. Doing so will remove the canard of having to continue a war as a means of honoring those who perished earlier in the conflict by sacrificing more lives as a way of demonstrating our commitment to their memory and sacrifices. Not one person in uniform should be asked to or required to die for a concept that defies common sense. If the decision is made to go to war, it should be total war...destroy enemy forces, destroy a countries infrastructure (physical abilities and food production), subject the population to our total control and dependence upon us for their safety & survival...after accomplishing these steps, we rebuild the country and instill the democratic process within the population. If evidence indicates these steps cannot be accomplished, we do not go to war. S/F Gordon",

If Iraq and Afghanistan has proven anything, it is our political and military inability to be honest with ourselves. Even a novice could have evaluated the data available pertaining to both countries to realize involvement in a ground war in either country would be an effort in futility. In my life's experiences, if something is good then people will want it...some will want it so badly they will take it, steal it. If something is perceived to be good, one does not need to provide it at the end of the barrel of a gun or with bombs. No recipient of a good thing wants it delivered from an aircraft at 30,000 feet...smart bomb, dumb bomb makes no difference. If America is intent upon exporting democracy worldwide, we had better come up with a better way of accomplishing such a goal than our current set of tactics. Doing so will remove the canard of having to continue a war as a means of honoring those who perished earlier in the conflict by sacrificing more lives as a way of demonstrating our commitment to their memory and sacrifices. Not one person in uniform should be asked to or required to die for a concept that defies common sense. If the decision is made to go to war, it should be total war...destroy enemy forces, destroy a countries infrastructure (physical abilities and food production), subject the population to our total control and dependence upon us for their safety & survival...after accomplishing these steps, we rebuild the country and instill the democratic process within the population. If evidence indicates these steps cannot be accomplished, we do not go to war. S/F Gordon",

It was reported that diminished oil revenues were going to affect the pace of Iraqi reconstruction as well as plans to train and deploy larger police formations. Some bodies were reported withdrawing from the Sons of Iraq program due to non-payment of salary or no follow through on government jobs. Attacks, or other incidents, involving oil transmission were causing increased attention to security. Oil exploration in Iraq is continuing with foreign firms bidding to open new fields in the south and Kurdish north. Such explorations last week turned up another Saddam era mass grave. Kidnappers of British private security personnel indicated that these men were still alive, more than a year after they were taken.",

In other news, a series of car bombings in Baghdad culminated with a SAWHA uprising that left a number of people dead and wounded after clashes between US and Iraqi forces and Sunni militia. Reports of some sort of pogrom against homosexuals in Baghdad hit the news. Another 4 were found shot or stabbed last week. MNFI reported an increasing number of attacks using Russian-designed anti-tank hand grenades. The weapons were sourced to either Syria, or Iran which border Iraq, along with Turkey, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia where the weapons definitely couldn't come from. The British pulled out of Basra concluding their stint in Iraq. Basra international airport was turned over to US forces and was reported 'ready for operations' after a British facelift. It has yet to re-open. But things are looking up, former Blackwater employees are finding work in Iraq. This message has been edited. Last edited by: popsiq, Wed 08 April 2009 08:32 AM",
