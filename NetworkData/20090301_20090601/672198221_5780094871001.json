The fleecing of both military and civilian tax payers. Just think if that overbloated wasted money went towards something like schools or police/fire departments. I have been to many 3rd & 2nd world countries loaded with government corruption. The only difference between them and US is that we hide it behind laws and corporate umbrellas.

As a dead-ringer, you can pose for an applicant and take the LSAT on the condition that the person you helped get admitted, promises you in writing to become a worker in our government, and do housecleaning to get rid of all the corruption. I say Harvard or Yale becaause if you're Ivy League, you're the first in line for any job. I don't know any other way to straighten out the corruption except to insert compassionate people who want to see justice done, into the system. These guys and gals are friggin crooks.
