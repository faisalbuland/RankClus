It's long, long overdue as the buttress on the Oklahoma side has fallen away and the piers (concrete encased wooden pilings) are rotten below the waterline. Thank goodness for the stimulus!",

Just think, If someone with common sense took over the government here this could be the greatest State in the Union. We could pass a law to make it illegal to be a liberal. WE could do away with most of the stupid regulations tha bog down the achievers and reward people that save the taxpayers money etc. Sorry! I get a little carried away with my dreams.",
