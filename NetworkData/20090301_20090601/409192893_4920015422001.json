It seems to me Wars against countries with Democracy are a hell of a lot easier In Modern times Because you get to have collateral damage the emphasis on precision gets changed to damage When fighting with a dictatorship you have less room for error, we've painted Dictators as horrible people who oppress their citizens and don't care about humanity....... this is a trap we set ourselves up for If we now accidentally kill a few citizens it becomes horrible thing and its hard to defend If it were a democracy more ppl would be apathetic to that, after-all they had a choice So its my opinion that we should stop describing Dictators that we might potentially get into conflicts with as Evil, Bad, Cruel Dictators (Even if they are) It only makes things tougher for our troops.",
