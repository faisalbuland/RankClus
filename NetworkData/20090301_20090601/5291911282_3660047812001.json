Do they (as rich and isolated as they are) think they can send us (Military) off to war or even in the normal course of military duties get damaged and expect us TO PAY FOR IT? I say it's high time that the folks who have bled or paid the ultimate sacrifice be heard loud and clear. We are mad as hell and want take this much longer!!
