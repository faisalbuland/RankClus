I have recently noticed many military personnel in my area wearing their uniforms in a very different standard than we did when I was active duty and even reserve. Yesterday my wife and I were eating lunch in a local restaurant and three male E-5\u2019s walked in. I noticed them from the parking lot and none wore a cover outside. There was no trace of any pleats, crease, or starch on any of the uniforms. One fellow even had his trousers unbloused. They appeared clean and didn\u2019t look like they had come from any work or training site. I know they can\u2019t do much with the boots because they are suede but overall these guys looked bad.",
