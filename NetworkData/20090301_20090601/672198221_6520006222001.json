The LEGAL DEFINITION of \"sexual orientation\" refers only to the GENDER to which a person is sexually attracted. It does not include ANY of those other fetishes, and certainly does not include pedophilia. So, unless you can show me any real government documents that indicate that the hate crime bill (HR1913 and S.909) would include anything but actual \"sexual orientation\" as defined by the GENDER to which a person is sexually attracted, then I suggest your rescind this BS thread.",

So they had to ask.. quote: Morally wrong? This was an odd statement indeed from a scientific organization. What, then, was the APA's moral position on, say...adultery or abortion? What about the morality of sexually open relationships? Would APA follow up with an official position on, say, the morality of polygamy? quote: Indeed, the time was then ripe for layman to issue a fruitful challenge to the entire concept of psychological health--its inherent limitations, its value-laden nature, and its meaninglessness without dependence on an underlying social-moral philosophy. Most of all, the discussion could have addressed psychology's inability to scientifically answer the essential, basic questions upon which any meaningful psychology must be based...foundational questions such as, \"What is good?\" And, \"What is the meaning and purpose of sexuality?\" Or, \"How does one define 'self-actualization'?\" \"What exactly is our distinctively human nature? How does our nature require that we live?\" In an age when even our culture's moral leaders feel obligated to look to science to defend their positions, such a discussion could clarify to the public what psychologists already know but tend to be loathe to publicly admit--that science alone has a limited capacity to either define or resolve our social-moral problems. \"http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/157/5/838\" quote: The psychiatric profession still correctly considers pedophilia to be a mental disorder. However, like heterosexuality and homosexuality (orientations that differ from one another on the basis of differences in sexual attraction), pedophilia, too, can be thought of as a sexual orientation that is different from others on the basis of age of attraction. As with other sexual orientations, irrespective of the relative contributions of genetics and environment, maturing individuals discover the nature of their own attractions; such attractions are not the consequence of a volitional decision.
