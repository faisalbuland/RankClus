The author was the General Council to the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, from 2001-03 quote: By VICKI DIVOLL Published: May 12, 2009 Washington JUST four members of Congress were notified in 2002 when the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d program was first approved and carried out, according to documents released by the agency last week. They were Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby and Representatives Porter Goss and Nancy Pelosi, then the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees \u2014 the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Each was briefed orally and it was understood that they were not to speak about the program with anyone, including their colleagues on the committees. It\u2019s logical to ask, so what if it was only four members? If they objected to the program, why didn\u2019t they take steps to change it or stop it? Maybe they should have tried. But as a practical matter, there was very little, if anything, the Gang of Four could have done to affect the Bush administration\u2019s decision on the enhanced interrogation techniques program. To stop it, they needed the whole Congress. The framers of the Constitution gave aggregate, not individual, powers to the legislative branch. For the Gang of Four to have waved their arms and yelled at mid-level C.I.A. briefers, or written harsh letters to the president and vice president, would have been useless. Four members do not have the ability, on their own, to bring the great weight of the constitutional authority of Congress to bear. There are C.I.A. \u201ccovert action\u201d activities \u2014 like the detention and interrogation program \u2014 that because of their significance, and risks, require participation from both the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees in their initiation and oversight. The National Security Act defines covert action programs as those designed \u201cto influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d The C.I.A. is prohibited by law from conducting covert action activities without express presidential approval \u2014 and this is not a requirement that the agency takes lightly. The National Security Act also requires that when the president approves a covert action program the two Congressional intelligence committees shall be \u201cnotified.\u201d The committees do not have disapproval power, nor can they force changes at that time. But the law does require the executive branch to provide timely, written notice to the full committees \u2014 which together consist of fewer than 40 members \u2014 of the plans. It is unlawful for the executive branch to limit notification, as it did here, to the Gang of Four. There is no such entity recognized in the National Security Act. Federal law does provide, however, for notification of fewer lawmakers than the full intelligence committees, but only when \u201cextraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States\u201d are at stake. Under those very limited situations, the notification may be to the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which includes the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate, in addition to the intelligence committee leaders. It should be noted that there is a legal argument that the interrogation program was merely foreign intelligence \u201ccollection,\u201d and not \u201ccovert action\u201d at all, because it was used to elicit information that already existed in the minds of the detainees. In that case, there is no exception in the law for Gangs of Four or Eight, and every member of the two committees should have been notified. What it boils down to is this: many of the laws mandating Congressional notification of covert action programs were enacted after the Senate\u2019s Church Committee hearings in the late 1970s had revealed widespread abuses by the intelligence agencies domestically and overseas. The House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 created at that time \u2014 were designed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the full Congress on significant intelligence activities. These committees were entrusted with the faith of the American people to oversee aggressive intelligence operations done in all of our names, and to ensure that they are necessary, effective and consistent with American laws and values. But the narrow Gang of Eight exception, or worse, the Gang of Four, has swallowed up the notification rule. This is a trend that began before the Bush administration, and the types of programs about which the Church Committee was most concerned now receive the least oversight \u2014 in many cases, no oversight \u2014 by Congress. It is reasonable for us to wonder how many other covert action programs the Bush administration kept from the committees. One might ask whether it was just too risky to share information about the interrogation program with so many members of Congress. Isn\u2019t four better than 40, if we must keep this secret? It is true that the Gang of Eight exception was included in the law to give some flexibility, in a subset of cases, to the executive branch to limit the number of legislators who receive a notification, at least initially. Sometimes, for example, if an operation is imminent \u2014 like the capture of an al Qaeda leader \u2014 short-term security may require it to be held very closely. But there is nothing in the legislative history of the Gang of Eight exception that supports the use made of it by the Bush administration \u2014 to shield, indefinitely, a politically controversial program from Congressional scrutiny. The exception has been abused to the point where it no longer has meaning, and Congress should examine whether it should be clarified or even eliminated. If we do keep it, Congress should spell out in detail the very limited circumstances in which a Gang of Eight briefing may be given, and permit such secrecy for only a limited time. Only short-term operational security \u2014 not a controversial policy choice \u2014 should justify a temporary close hold. Of course, the real reason that notifying four members of Congress was better than 40 to the Bush White House is crystal-clear \u2014 to eliminate political pushback. Check the box that Congress was informed just in case, someday, the program becomes public and things get rough. But do so in a way that the legislative branch is not in a position to cause any trouble. In Article I of the Constitution, the framers gave Congress two extraordinary powers over the executive branch \u2014 the power of the purse and the power to make laws. It is unconstitutional for the executive branch to spend one dime on a program for which Congress has not appropriated funds. And if Congress passes a law forbidding the executive branch from engaging in an activity, it must stop, or people go to jail. But four members cannot stop financing and ban activities on their own \u2014 that takes the whole Congress. So what might the four have done? They could have demanded that the full committees receive the briefings and that more information be provided. If the White House objected, they could have told their colleagues anyway. The committees then could have put a classified budget provision in the intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2003 cutting off money for the program, or delineating how the C.I.A. must treat detainees. The speech and debate clause of the Constitution shields senators and representatives from civil and criminal liability in the performance of their legislative duties. It would have protected those members if they had decided to march down to the House or Senate floor and denounce the Bush administration for engaging in torture, though that approach not only could have harmed C.I.A. operations, but also surely would have been political suicide. But would the full committees \u2014 or even the full Congress \u2014 have taken action to stop the enhanced interrogation program if they had been informed of it in 2002? Admittedly, the memory of 9/11 was very raw then and we cannot know if things would have turned out differently. We do know, however, that the full committees weren\u2019t briefed on the C.I.A. detention and interrogation program until 2006, on the same day that the program was made public by President George W. Bush. Since then, the committees have tried, so far without success, to amend federal law to hold the C.I.A. to the same strict interrogation standards for military intelligence collection spelled out in the Army Field Manual. Even if the results had been the same, we would now at least have the cold comfort of knowing that our constitutional system of checks and balances had been put into play before a program that risked our fundamental values was carried out on our behalf. The framers of the Constitution never intended for small numbers of legislators to be culled from Congress and expected to act as a check on the excesses of the executive.

Under those very limited situations, the notification may be to the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which includes the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate, in addition to the intelligence committee leaders. It should be noted that there is a legal argument that the interrogation program was merely foreign intelligence \u201ccollection,\u201d and not \u201ccovert action\u201d at all, because it was used to elicit information that already existed in the minds of the detainees. In that case, there is no exception in the law for Gangs of Four or Eight, and every member of the two committees should have been notified. What it boils down to is this: many of the laws mandating Congressional notification of covert action programs were enacted after the Senate\u2019s Church Committee hearings in the late 1970s had revealed widespread abuses by the intelligence agencies domestically and overseas. The House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 created at that time \u2014 were designed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the full Congress on significant intelligence activities. These committees were entrusted with the faith of the American people to oversee aggressive intelligence operations done in all of our names, and to ensure that they are necessary, effective and consistent with American laws and values. But the narrow Gang of Eight exception, or worse, the Gang of Four, has swallowed up the notification rule. This is a trend that began before the Bush administration, and the types of programs about which the Church Committee was most concerned now receive the least oversight \u2014 in many cases, no oversight \u2014 by Congress. It is reasonable for us to wonder how many other covert action programs the Bush administration kept from the committees. One might ask whether it was just too risky to share information about the interrogation program with so many members of Congress. Isn\u2019t four better than 40, if we must keep this secret? It is true that the Gang of Eight exception was included in the law to give some flexibility, in a subset of cases, to the executive branch to limit the number of legislators who receive a notification, at least initially. Sometimes, for example, if an operation is imminent \u2014 like the capture of an al Qaeda leader \u2014 short-term security may require it to be held very closely. But there is nothing in the legislative history of the Gang of Eight exception that supports the use made of it by the Bush administration \u2014 to shield, indefinitely, a politically controversial program from Congressional scrutiny. The exception has been abused to the point where it no longer has meaning, and Congress should examine whether it should be clarified or even eliminated. If we do keep it, Congress should spell out in detail the very limited circumstances in which a Gang of Eight briefing may be given, and permit such secrecy for only a limited time. Only short-term operational security \u2014 not a controversial policy choice \u2014 should justify a temporary close hold. Of course, the real reason that notifying four members of Congress was better than 40 to the Bush White House is crystal-clear \u2014 to eliminate political pushback. Check the box that Congress was informed just in case, someday, the program becomes public and things get rough. But do so in a way that the legislative branch is not in a position to cause any trouble. In Article I of the Constitution, the framers gave Congress two extraordinary powers over the executive branch \u2014 the power of the purse and the power to make laws. It is unconstitutional for the executive branch to spend one dime on a program for which Congress has not appropriated funds. And if Congress passes a law forbidding the executive branch from engaging in an activity, it must stop, or people go to jail. But four members cannot stop financing and ban activities on their own \u2014 that takes the whole Congress. So what might the four have done? They could have demanded that the full committees receive the briefings and that more information be provided. If the White House objected, they could have told their colleagues anyway. The committees then could have put a classified budget provision in the intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2003 cutting off money for the program, or delineating how the C.I.A. must treat detainees. The speech and debate clause of the Constitution shields senators and representatives from civil and criminal liability in the performance of their legislative duties. It would have protected those members if they had decided to march down to the House or Senate floor and denounce the Bush administration for engaging in torture, though that approach not only could have harmed C.I.A. operations, but also surely would have been political suicide. But would the full committees \u2014 or even the full Congress \u2014 have taken action to stop the enhanced interrogation program if they had been informed of it in 2002? Admittedly, the memory of 9/11 was very raw then and we cannot know if things would have turned out differently. We do know, however, that the full committees weren\u2019t briefed on the C.I.A. detention and interrogation program until 2006, on the same day that the program was made public by President George W. Bush. Since then, the committees have tried, so far without success, to amend federal law to hold the C.I.A. to the same strict interrogation standards for military intelligence collection spelled out in the Army Field Manual. Even if the results had been the same, we would now at least have the cold comfort of knowing that our constitutional system of checks and balances had been put into play before a program that risked our fundamental values was carried out on our behalf. The framers of the Constitution never intended for small numbers of legislators to be culled from Congress and expected to act as a check on the excesses of the executive.

The author was the General Council to the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, from 2001-03 quote: By VICKI DIVOLL Published: May 12, 2009 Washington JUST four members of Congress were notified in 2002 when the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d program was first approved and carried out, according to documents released by the agency last week. They were Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby and Representatives Porter Goss and Nancy Pelosi, then the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees \u2014 the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Each was briefed orally and it was understood that they were not to speak about the program with anyone, including their colleagues on the committees. It\u2019s logical to ask, so what if it was only four members? If they objected to the program, why didn\u2019t they take steps to change it or stop it? Maybe they should have tried. But as a practical matter, there was very little, if anything, the Gang of Four could have done to affect the Bush administration\u2019s decision on the enhanced interrogation techniques program. To stop it, they needed the whole Congress. The framers of the Constitution gave aggregate, not individual, powers to the legislative branch. For the Gang of Four to have waved their arms and yelled at mid-level C.I.A. briefers, or written harsh letters to the president and vice president, would have been useless. Four members do not have the ability, on their own, to bring the great weight of the constitutional authority of Congress to bear. There are C.I.A. \u201ccovert action\u201d activities \u2014 like the detention and interrogation program \u2014 that because of their significance, and risks, require participation from both the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees in their initiation and oversight. The National Security Act defines covert action programs as those designed \u201cto influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d The C.I.A. is prohibited by law from conducting covert action activities without express presidential approval \u2014 and this is not a requirement that the agency takes lightly. The National Security Act also requires that when the president approves a covert action program the two Congressional intelligence committees shall be \u201cnotified.\u201d The committees do not have disapproval power, nor can they force changes at that time. But the law does require the executive branch to provide timely, written notice to the full committees \u2014 which together consist of fewer than 40 members \u2014 of the plans. It is unlawful for the executive branch to limit notification, as it did here, to the Gang of Four. There is no such entity recognized in the National Security Act.

        "content": "Here's an objective summary of the issues involved in Congessional lack of action over the use of torture. The author was the General Council to the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, from 2001-03 quote: By VICKI DIVOLL Published: May 12, 2009 Washington JUST four members of Congress were notified in 2002 when the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d program was first approved and carried out, according to documents released by the agency last week. They were Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby and Representatives Porter Goss and Nancy Pelosi, then the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees \u2014 the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Each was briefed orally and it was understood that they were not to speak about the program with anyone, including their colleagues on the committees. It\u2019s logical to ask, so what if it was only four members? If they objected to the program, why didn\u2019t they take steps to change it or stop it? Maybe they should have tried. But as a practical matter, there was very little, if anything, the Gang of Four could have done to affect the Bush administration\u2019s decision on the enhanced interrogation techniques program. To stop it, they needed the whole Congress. The framers of the Constitution gave aggregate, not individual, powers to the legislative branch. For the Gang of Four to have waved their arms and yelled at mid-level C.I.A. briefers, or written harsh letters to the president and vice president, would have been useless. Four members do not have the ability, on their own, to bring the great weight of the constitutional authority of Congress to bear. There are C.I.A. \u201ccovert action\u201d activities \u2014 like the detention and interrogation program \u2014 that because of their significance, and risks, require participation from both the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees in their initiation and oversight. The National Security Act defines covert action programs as those designed \u201cto influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d The C.I.A. is prohibited by law from conducting covert action activities without express presidential approval \u2014 and this is not a requirement that the agency takes lightly. The National Security Act also requires that when the president approves a covert action program the two Congressional intelligence committees shall be \u201cnotified.\u201d The committees do not have disapproval power, nor can they force changes at that time. But the law does require the executive branch to provide timely, written notice to the full committees \u2014 which together consist of fewer than 40 members \u2014 of the plans. It is unlawful for the executive branch to limit notification, as it did here, to the Gang of Four. There is no such entity recognized in the National Security Act. Federal law does provide, however, for notification of fewer lawmakers than the full intelligence committees, but only when \u201cextraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States\u201d are at stake. Under those very limited situations, the notification may be to the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which includes the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate, in addition to the intelligence committee leaders. It should be noted that there is a legal argument that the interrogation program was merely foreign intelligence \u201ccollection,\u201d and not \u201ccovert action\u201d at all, because it was used to elicit information that already existed in the minds of the detainees. In that case, there is no exception in the law for Gangs of Four or Eight, and every member of the two committees should have been notified. What it boils down to is this: many of the laws mandating Congressional notification of covert action programs were enacted after the Senate\u2019s Church Committee hearings in the late 1970s had revealed widespread abuses by the intelligence agencies domestically and overseas. The House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 created at that time \u2014 were designed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the full Congress on significant intelligence activities. These committees were entrusted with the faith of the American people to oversee aggressive intelligence operations done in all of our names, and to ensure that they are necessary, effective and consistent with American laws and values. But the narrow Gang of Eight exception, or worse, the Gang of Four, has swallowed up the notification rule. This is a trend that began before the Bush administration, and the types of programs about which the Church Committee was most concerned now receive the least oversight \u2014 in many cases, no oversight \u2014 by Congress. It is reasonable for us to wonder how many other covert action programs the Bush administration kept from the committees. One might ask whether it was just too risky to share information about the interrogation program with so many members of Congress. Isn\u2019t four better than 40, if we must keep this secret? It is true that the Gang of Eight exception was included in the law to give some flexibility, in a subset of cases, to the executive branch to limit the number of legislators who receive a notification, at least initially. Sometimes, for example, if an operation is imminent \u2014 like the capture of an al Qaeda leader \u2014 short-term security may require it to be held very closely. But there is nothing in the legislative history of the Gang of Eight exception that supports the use made of it by the Bush administration \u2014 to shield, indefinitely, a politically controversial program from Congressional scrutiny. The exception has been abused to the point where it no longer has meaning, and Congress should examine whether it should be clarified or even eliminated. If we do keep it, Congress should spell out in detail the very limited circumstances in which a Gang of Eight briefing may be given, and permit such secrecy for only a limited time. Only short-term operational security \u2014 not a controversial policy choice \u2014 should justify a temporary close hold. Of course, the real reason that notifying four members of Congress was better than 40 to the Bush White House is crystal-clear \u2014 to eliminate political pushback. Check the box that Congress was informed just in case, someday, the program becomes public and things get rough. But do so in a way that the legislative branch is not in a position to cause any trouble. In Article I of the Constitution, the framers gave Congress two extraordinary powers over the executive branch \u2014 the power of the purse and the power to make laws. It is unconstitutional for the executive branch to spend one dime on a program for which Congress has not appropriated funds. And if Congress passes a law forbidding the executive branch from engaging in an activity, it must stop, or people go to jail. But four members cannot stop financing and ban activities on their own \u2014 that takes the whole Congress. So what might the four have done? They could have demanded that the full committees receive the briefings and that more information be provided. If the White House objected, they could have told their colleagues anyway. The committees then could have put a classified budget provision in the intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2003 cutting off money for the program, or delineating how the C.I.A. must treat detainees. The speech and debate clause of the Constitution shields senators and representatives from civil and criminal liability in the performance of their legislative duties. It would have protected those members if they had decided to march down to the House or Senate floor and denounce the Bush administration for engaging in torture, though that approach not only could have harmed C.I.A. operations, but also surely would have been political suicide. But would the full committees \u2014 or even the full Congress \u2014 have taken action to stop the enhanced interrogation program if they had been informed of it in 2002? Admittedly, the memory of 9/11 was very raw then and we cannot know if things would have turned out differently. We do know, however, that the full committees weren\u2019t briefed on the C.I.A. detention and interrogation program until 2006, on the same day that the program was made public by President George W. Bush. Since then, the committees have tried, so far without success, to amend federal law to hold the C.I.A. to the same strict interrogation standards for military intelligence collection spelled out in the Army Field Manual. Even if the results had been the same, we would now at least have the cold comfort of knowing that our constitutional system of checks and balances had been put into play before a program that risked our fundamental values was carried out on our behalf.

But do so in a way that the legislative branch is not in a position to cause any trouble. In Article I of the Constitution, the framers gave Congress two extraordinary powers over the executive branch \u2014 the power of the purse and the power to make laws. It is unconstitutional for the executive branch to spend one dime on a program for which Congress has not appropriated funds. And if Congress passes a law forbidding the executive branch from engaging in an activity, it must stop, or people go to jail. But four members cannot stop financing and ban activities on their own \u2014 that takes the whole Congress. So what might the four have done? They could have demanded that the full committees receive the briefings and that more information be provided. If the White House objected, they could have told their colleagues anyway. The committees then could have put a classified budget provision in the intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2003 cutting off money for the program, or delineating how the C.I.A. must treat detainees. The speech and debate clause of the Constitution shields senators and representatives from civil and criminal liability in the performance of their legislative duties. It would have protected those members if they had decided to march down to the House or Senate floor and denounce the Bush administration for engaging in torture, though that approach not only could have harmed C.I.A. operations, but also surely would have been political suicide. But would the full committees \u2014 or even the full Congress \u2014 have taken action to stop the enhanced interrogation program if they had been informed of it in 2002? Admittedly, the memory of 9/11 was very raw then and we cannot know if things would have turned out differently. We do know, however, that the full committees weren\u2019t briefed on the C.I.A. detention and interrogation program until 2006, on the same day that the program was made public by President George W. Bush. Since then, the committees have tried, so far without success, to amend federal law to hold the C.I.A. to the same strict interrogation standards for military intelligence collection spelled out in the Army Field Manual. Even if the results had been the same, we would now at least have the cold comfort of knowing that our constitutional system of checks and balances had been put into play before a program that risked our fundamental values was carried out on our behalf. The framers of the Constitution never intended for small numbers of legislators to be culled from Congress and expected to act as a check on the excesses of the executive.

The author was the General Council to the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, from 2001-03 quote: By VICKI DIVOLL Published: May 12, 2009 Washington JUST four members of Congress were notified in 2002 when the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d program was first approved and carried out, according to documents released by the agency last week. They were Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby and Representatives Porter Goss and Nancy Pelosi, then the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees \u2014 the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Each was briefed orally and it was understood that they were not to speak about the program with anyone, including their colleagues on the committees. It\u2019s logical to ask, so what if it was only four members? If they objected to the program, why didn\u2019t they take steps to change it or stop it? Maybe they should have tried. But as a practical matter, there was very little, if anything, the Gang of Four could have done to affect the Bush administration\u2019s decision on the enhanced interrogation techniques program. To stop it, they needed the whole Congress. The framers of the Constitution gave aggregate, not individual, powers to the legislative branch. For the Gang of Four to have waved their arms and yelled at mid-level C.I.A. briefers, or written harsh letters to the president and vice president, would have been useless. Four members do not have the ability, on their own, to bring the great weight of the constitutional authority of Congress to bear. There are C.I.A. \u201ccovert action\u201d activities \u2014 like the detention and interrogation program \u2014 that because of their significance, and risks, require participation from both the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees in their initiation and oversight. The National Security Act defines covert action programs as those designed \u201cto influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d The C.I.A. is prohibited by law from conducting covert action activities without express presidential approval \u2014 and this is not a requirement that the agency takes lightly. The National Security Act also requires that when the president approves a covert action program the two Congressional intelligence committees shall be \u201cnotified.\u201d The committees do not have disapproval power, nor can they force changes at that time. But the law does require the executive branch to provide timely, written notice to the full committees \u2014 which together consist of fewer than 40 members \u2014 of the plans. It is unlawful for the executive branch to limit notification, as it did here, to the Gang of Four. There is no such entity recognized in the National Security Act. Federal law does provide, however, for notification of fewer lawmakers than the full intelligence committees, but only when \u201cextraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States\u201d are at stake. Under those very limited situations, the notification may be to the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which includes the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate, in addition to the intelligence committee leaders. It should be noted that there is a legal argument that the interrogation program was merely foreign intelligence \u201ccollection,\u201d and not \u201ccovert action\u201d at all, because it was used to elicit information that already existed in the minds of the detainees. In that case, there is no exception in the law for Gangs of Four or Eight, and every member of the two committees should have been notified. What it boils down to is this: many of the laws mandating Congressional notification of covert action programs were enacted after the Senate\u2019s Church Committee hearings in the late 1970s had revealed widespread abuses by the intelligence agencies domestically and overseas. The House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 created at that time \u2014 were designed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the full Congress on significant intelligence activities. These committees were entrusted with the faith of the American people to oversee aggressive intelligence operations done in all of our names, and to ensure that they are necessary, effective and consistent with American laws and values. But the narrow Gang of Eight exception, or worse, the Gang of Four, has swallowed up the notification rule. This is a trend that began before the Bush administration, and the types of programs about which the Church Committee was most concerned now receive the least oversight \u2014 in many cases, no oversight \u2014 by Congress. It is reasonable for us to wonder how many other covert action programs the Bush administration kept from the committees. One might ask whether it was just too risky to share information about the interrogation program with so many members of Congress. Isn\u2019t four better than 40, if we must keep this secret? It is true that the Gang of Eight exception was included in the law to give some flexibility, in a subset of cases, to the executive branch to limit the number of legislators who receive a notification, at least initially. Sometimes, for example, if an operation is imminent \u2014 like the capture of an al Qaeda leader \u2014 short-term security may require it to be held very closely. But there is nothing in the legislative history of the Gang of Eight exception that supports the use made of it by the Bush administration \u2014 to shield, indefinitely, a politically controversial program from Congressional scrutiny. The exception has been abused to the point where it no longer has meaning, and Congress should examine whether it should be clarified or even eliminated. If we do keep it, Congress should spell out in detail the very limited circumstances in which a Gang of Eight briefing may be given, and permit such secrecy for only a limited time. Only short-term operational security \u2014 not a controversial policy choice \u2014 should justify a temporary close hold. Of course, the real reason that notifying four members of Congress was better than 40 to the Bush White House is crystal-clear \u2014 to eliminate political pushback.

        "content": "Here's an objective summary of the issues involved in Congessional lack of action over the use of torture. The author was the General Council to the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, from 2001-03 quote: By VICKI DIVOLL Published: May 12, 2009 Washington JUST four members of Congress were notified in 2002 when the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d program was first approved and carried out, according to documents released by the agency last week. They were Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby and Representatives Porter Goss and Nancy Pelosi, then the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees \u2014 the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Each was briefed orally and it was understood that they were not to speak about the program with anyone, including their colleagues on the committees. It\u2019s logical to ask, so what if it was only four members? If they objected to the program, why didn\u2019t they take steps to change it or stop it? Maybe they should have tried. But as a practical matter, there was very little, if anything, the Gang of Four could have done to affect the Bush administration\u2019s decision on the enhanced interrogation techniques program. To stop it, they needed the whole Congress. The framers of the Constitution gave aggregate, not individual, powers to the legislative branch. For the Gang of Four to have waved their arms and yelled at mid-level C.I.A. briefers, or written harsh letters to the president and vice president, would have been useless. Four members do not have the ability, on their own, to bring the great weight of the constitutional authority of Congress to bear. There are C.I.A. \u201ccovert action\u201d activities \u2014 like the detention and interrogation program \u2014 that because of their significance, and risks, require participation from both the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees in their initiation and oversight. The National Security Act defines covert action programs as those designed \u201cto influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d The C.I.A. is prohibited by law from conducting covert action activities without express presidential approval \u2014 and this is not a requirement that the agency takes lightly. The National Security Act also requires that when the president approves a covert action program the two Congressional intelligence committees shall be \u201cnotified.\u201d The committees do not have disapproval power, nor can they force changes at that time. But the law does require the executive branch to provide timely, written notice to the full committees \u2014 which together consist of fewer than 40 members \u2014 of the plans. It is unlawful for the executive branch to limit notification, as it did here, to the Gang of Four. There is no such entity recognized in the National Security Act. Federal law does provide, however, for notification of fewer lawmakers than the full intelligence committees, but only when \u201cextraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States\u201d are at stake. Under those very limited situations, the notification may be to the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which includes the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate, in addition to the intelligence committee leaders. It should be noted that there is a legal argument that the interrogation program was merely foreign intelligence \u201ccollection,\u201d and not \u201ccovert action\u201d at all, because it was used to elicit information that already existed in the minds of the detainees. In that case, there is no exception in the law for Gangs of Four or Eight, and every member of the two committees should have been notified. What it boils down to is this: many of the laws mandating Congressional notification of covert action programs were enacted after the Senate\u2019s Church Committee hearings in the late 1970s had revealed widespread abuses by the intelligence agencies domestically and overseas. The House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 created at that time \u2014 were designed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the full Congress on significant intelligence activities. These committees were entrusted with the faith of the American people to oversee aggressive intelligence operations done in all of our names, and to ensure that they are necessary, effective and consistent with American laws and values. But the narrow Gang of Eight exception, or worse, the Gang of Four, has swallowed up the notification rule. This is a trend that began before the Bush administration, and the types of programs about which the Church Committee was most concerned now receive the least oversight \u2014 in many cases, no oversight \u2014 by Congress. It is reasonable for us to wonder how many other covert action programs the Bush administration kept from the committees. One might ask whether it was just too risky to share information about the interrogation program with so many members of Congress. Isn\u2019t four better than 40, if we must keep this secret? It is true that the Gang of Eight exception was included in the law to give some flexibility, in a subset of cases, to the executive branch to limit the number of legislators who receive a notification, at least initially. Sometimes, for example, if an operation is imminent \u2014 like the capture of an al Qaeda leader \u2014 short-term security may require it to be held very closely. But there is nothing in the legislative history of the Gang of Eight exception that supports the use made of it by the Bush administration \u2014 to shield, indefinitely, a politically controversial program from Congressional scrutiny. The exception has been abused to the point where it no longer has meaning, and Congress should examine whether it should be clarified or even eliminated. If we do keep it, Congress should spell out in detail the very limited circumstances in which a Gang of Eight briefing may be given, and permit such secrecy for only a limited time. Only short-term operational security \u2014 not a controversial policy choice \u2014 should justify a temporary close hold. Of course, the real reason that notifying four members of Congress was better than 40 to the Bush White House is crystal-clear \u2014 to eliminate political pushback. Check the box that Congress was informed just in case, someday, the program becomes public and things get rough. But do so in a way that the legislative branch is not in a position to cause any trouble. In Article I of the Constitution, the framers gave Congress two extraordinary powers over the executive branch \u2014 the power of the purse and the power to make laws. It is unconstitutional for the executive branch to spend one dime on a program for which Congress has not appropriated funds. And if Congress passes a law forbidding the executive branch from engaging in an activity, it must stop, or people go to jail. But four members cannot stop financing and ban activities on their own \u2014 that takes the whole Congress. So what might the four have done? They could have demanded that the full committees receive the briefings and that more information be provided. If the White House objected, they could have told their colleagues anyway. The committees then could have put a classified budget provision in the intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2003 cutting off money for the program, or delineating how the C.I.A. must treat detainees. The speech and debate clause of the Constitution shields senators and representatives from civil and criminal liability in the performance of their legislative duties. It would have protected those members if they had decided to march down to the House or Senate floor and denounce the Bush administration for engaging in torture, though that approach not only could have harmed C.I.A. operations, but also surely would have been political suicide. But would the full committees \u2014 or even the full Congress \u2014 have taken action to stop the enhanced interrogation program if they had been informed of it in 2002? Admittedly, the memory of 9/11 was very raw then and we cannot know if things would have turned out differently. We do know, however, that the full committees weren\u2019t briefed on the C.I.A. detention and interrogation program until 2006, on the same day that the program was made public by President George W. Bush. Since then, the committees have tried, so far without success, to amend federal law to hold the C.I.A. to the same strict interrogation standards for military intelligence collection spelled out in the Army Field Manual. Even if the results had been the same, we would now at least have the cold comfort of knowing that our constitutional system of checks and balances had been put into play before a program that risked our fundamental values was carried out on our behalf.

        "quote": "By VICKI DIVOLL Published: May 12, 2009 Washington JUST four members of Congress were notified in 2002 when the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d program was first approved and carried out, according to documents released by the agency last week. They were Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby and Representatives Porter Goss and Nancy Pelosi, then the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees \u2014 the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Each was briefed orally and it was understood that they were not to speak about the program with anyone, including their colleagues on the committees. It\u2019s logical to ask, so what if it was only four members? If they objected to the program, why didn\u2019t they take steps to change it or stop it? Maybe they should have tried. But as a practical matter, there was very little, if anything, the Gang of Four could have done to affect the Bush administration\u2019s decision on the enhanced interrogation techniques program. To stop it, they needed the whole Congress. The framers of the Constitution gave aggregate, not individual, powers to the legislative branch. For the Gang of Four to have waved their arms and yelled at mid-level C.I.A. briefers, or written harsh letters to the president and vice president, would have been useless. Four members do not have the ability, on their own, to bring the great weight of the constitutional authority of Congress to bear. There are C.I.A. \u201ccovert action\u201d activities \u2014 like the detention and interrogation program \u2014 that because of their significance, and risks, require participation from both the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees in their initiation and oversight. The National Security Act defines covert action programs as those designed \u201cto influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d The C.I.A. is prohibited by law from conducting covert action activities without express presidential approval \u2014 and this is not a requirement that the agency takes lightly. The National Security Act also requires that when the president approves a covert action program the two Congressional intelligence committees shall be \u201cnotified.\u201d The committees do not have disapproval power, nor can they force changes at that time. But the law does require the executive branch to provide timely, written notice to the full committees \u2014 which together consist of fewer than 40 members \u2014 of the plans. It is unlawful for the executive branch to limit notification, as it did here, to the Gang of Four. There is no such entity recognized in the National Security Act. Federal law does provide, however, for notification of fewer lawmakers than the full intelligence committees, but only when \u201cextraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States\u201d are at stake. Under those very limited situations, the notification may be to the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which includes the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate, in addition to the intelligence committee leaders. It should be noted that there is a legal argument that the interrogation program was merely foreign intelligence \u201ccollection,\u201d and not \u201ccovert action\u201d at all, because it was used to elicit information that already existed in the minds of the detainees. In that case, there is no exception in the law for Gangs of Four or Eight, and every member of the two committees should have been notified. What it boils down to is this: many of the laws mandating Congressional notification of covert action programs were enacted after the Senate\u2019s Church Committee hearings in the late 1970s had revealed widespread abuses by the intelligence agencies domestically and overseas. The House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 created at that time \u2014 were designed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the full Congress on significant intelligence activities. These committees were entrusted with the faith of the American people to oversee aggressive intelligence operations done in all of our names, and to ensure that they are necessary, effective and consistent with American laws and values. But the narrow Gang of Eight exception, or worse, the Gang of Four, has swallowed up the notification rule. This is a trend that began before the Bush administration, and the types of programs about which the Church Committee was most concerned now receive the least oversight \u2014 in many cases, no oversight \u2014 by Congress. It is reasonable for us to wonder how many other covert action programs the Bush administration kept from the committees. One might ask whether it was just too risky to share information about the interrogation program with so many members of Congress. Isn\u2019t four better than 40, if we must keep this secret? It is true that the Gang of Eight exception was included in the law to give some flexibility, in a subset of cases, to the executive branch to limit the number of legislators who receive a notification, at least initially. Sometimes, for example, if an operation is imminent \u2014 like the capture of an al Qaeda leader \u2014 short-term security may require it to be held very closely. But there is nothing in the legislative history of the Gang of Eight exception that supports the use made of it by the Bush administration \u2014 to shield, indefinitely, a politically controversial program from Congressional scrutiny. The exception has been abused to the point where it no longer has meaning, and Congress should examine whether it should be clarified or even eliminated. If we do keep it, Congress should spell out in detail the very limited circumstances in which a Gang of Eight briefing may be given, and permit such secrecy for only a limited time. Only short-term operational security \u2014 not a controversial policy choice \u2014 should justify a temporary close hold. Of course, the real reason that notifying four members of Congress was better than 40 to the Bush White House is crystal-clear \u2014 to eliminate political pushback. Check the box that Congress was informed just in case, someday, the program becomes public and things get rough. But do so in a way that the legislative branch is not in a position to cause any trouble.

The author was the General Council to the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, from 2001-03 quote: By VICKI DIVOLL Published: May 12, 2009 Washington JUST four members of Congress were notified in 2002 when the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d program was first approved and carried out, according to documents released by the agency last week. They were Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby and Representatives Porter Goss and Nancy Pelosi, then the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees \u2014 the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Each was briefed orally and it was understood that they were not to speak about the program with anyone, including their colleagues on the committees. It\u2019s logical to ask, so what if it was only four members? If they objected to the program, why didn\u2019t they take steps to change it or stop it? Maybe they should have tried. But as a practical matter, there was very little, if anything, the Gang of Four could have done to affect the Bush administration\u2019s decision on the enhanced interrogation techniques program. To stop it, they needed the whole Congress. The framers of the Constitution gave aggregate, not individual, powers to the legislative branch. For the Gang of Four to have waved their arms and yelled at mid-level C.I.A. briefers, or written harsh letters to the president and vice president, would have been useless. Four members do not have the ability, on their own, to bring the great weight of the constitutional authority of Congress to bear. There are C.I.A. \u201ccovert action\u201d activities \u2014 like the detention and interrogation program \u2014 that because of their significance, and risks, require participation from both the White House and the Congressional intelligence committees in their initiation and oversight. The National Security Act defines covert action programs as those designed \u201cto influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d The C.I.A. is prohibited by law from conducting covert action activities without express presidential approval \u2014 and this is not a requirement that the agency takes lightly. The National Security Act also requires that when the president approves a covert action program the two Congressional intelligence committees shall be \u201cnotified.\u201d The committees do not have disapproval power, nor can they force changes at that time. But the law does require the executive branch to provide timely, written notice to the full committees \u2014 which together consist of fewer than 40 members \u2014 of the plans. It is unlawful for the executive branch to limit notification, as it did here, to the Gang of Four. There is no such entity recognized in the National Security Act. Federal law does provide, however, for notification of fewer lawmakers than the full intelligence committees, but only when \u201cextraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States\u201d are at stake. Under those very limited situations, the notification may be to the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which includes the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate, in addition to the intelligence committee leaders. It should be noted that there is a legal argument that the interrogation program was merely foreign intelligence \u201ccollection,\u201d and not \u201ccovert action\u201d at all, because it was used to elicit information that already existed in the minds of the detainees. In that case, there is no exception in the law for Gangs of Four or Eight, and every member of the two committees should have been notified. What it boils down to is this: many of the laws mandating Congressional notification of covert action programs were enacted after the Senate\u2019s Church Committee hearings in the late 1970s had revealed widespread abuses by the intelligence agencies domestically and overseas. The House and Senate intelligence committees \u2014 created at that time \u2014 were designed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the full Congress on significant intelligence activities. These committees were entrusted with the faith of the American people to oversee aggressive intelligence operations done in all of our names, and to ensure that they are necessary, effective and consistent with American laws and values. But the narrow Gang of Eight exception, or worse, the Gang of Four, has swallowed up the notification rule. This is a trend that began before the Bush administration, and the types of programs about which the Church Committee was most concerned now receive the least oversight \u2014 in many cases, no oversight \u2014 by Congress. It is reasonable for us to wonder how many other covert action programs the Bush administration kept from the committees. One might ask whether it was just too risky to share information about the interrogation program with so many members of Congress. Isn\u2019t four better than 40, if we must keep this secret? It is true that the Gang of Eight exception was included in the law to give some flexibility, in a subset of cases, to the executive branch to limit the number of legislators who receive a notification, at least initially. Sometimes, for example, if an operation is imminent \u2014 like the capture of an al Qaeda leader \u2014 short-term security may require it to be held very closely. But there is nothing in the legislative history of the Gang of Eight exception that supports the use made of it by the Bush administration \u2014 to shield, indefinitely, a politically controversial program from Congressional scrutiny. The exception has been abused to the point where it no longer has meaning, and Congress should examine whether it should be clarified or even eliminated. If we do keep it, Congress should spell out in detail the very limited circumstances in which a Gang of Eight briefing may be given, and permit such secrecy for only a limited time. Only short-term operational security \u2014 not a controversial policy choice \u2014 should justify a temporary close hold. Of course, the real reason that notifying four members of Congress was better than 40 to the Bush White House is crystal-clear \u2014 to eliminate political pushback. Check the box that Congress was informed just in case, someday, the program becomes public and things get rough. But do so in a way that the legislative branch is not in a position to cause any trouble. In Article I of the Constitution, the framers gave Congress two extraordinary powers over the executive branch \u2014 the power of the purse and the power to make laws. It is unconstitutional for the executive branch to spend one dime on a program for which Congress has not appropriated funds. And if Congress passes a law forbidding the executive branch from engaging in an activity, it must stop, or people go to jail. But four members cannot stop financing and ban activities on their own \u2014 that takes the whole Congress. So what might the four have done? They could have demanded that the full committees receive the briefings and that more information be provided. If the White House objected, they could have told their colleagues anyway. The committees then could have put a classified budget provision in the intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2003 cutting off money for the program, or delineating how the C.I.A. must treat detainees. The speech and debate clause of the Constitution shields senators and representatives from civil and criminal liability in the performance of their legislative duties. It would have protected those members if they had decided to march down to the House or Senate floor and denounce the Bush administration for engaging in torture, though that approach not only could have harmed C.I.A. operations, but also surely would have been political suicide. But would the full committees \u2014 or even the full Congress \u2014 have taken action to stop the enhanced interrogation program if they had been informed of it in 2002? Admittedly, the memory of 9/11 was very raw then and we cannot know if things would have turned out differently. We do know, however, that the full committees weren\u2019t briefed on the C.I.A. detention and interrogation program until 2006, on the same day that the program was made public by President George W. Bush. Since then, the committees have tried, so far without success, to amend federal law to hold the C.I.A. to the same strict interrogation standards for military intelligence collection spelled out in the Army Field Manual. Even if the results had been the same, we would now at least have the cold comfort of knowing that our constitutional system of checks and balances had been put into play before a program that risked our fundamental values was carried out on our behalf. The framers of the Constitution never intended for small numbers of legislators to be culled from Congress and expected to act as a check on the excesses of the executive. Vicki Divoll, a former deputy counsel to the C.I.A. Counterterrorist Center, was the general counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee from 2001 to 2003. She teaches government at the United States Naval Academy. \u201chttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/opinion/13divoll.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=Divoll&st=cse\u201d So basically what this says is that Pelosi failed in her duties along with the others briefed by not bringing this program that they were briefed upon to Congress's attention because they were more worried about getting relected than doing the job they were elected to do. Am I correct in that assumption? yup, and Obama has already caught that disease!",
