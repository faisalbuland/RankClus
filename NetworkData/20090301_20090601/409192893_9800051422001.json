This offers a little more detail than some others in it's comparison of the flat tax vs the fair tax: 'http://www.profutures.com/article.php/498/'' Other questions I have: If a company is operating overseas, how would we ensure that they will be paying their share of taxes? How will either the fair or flat tax handle import and export taxes? Which system would offer more incentive to do business over here, vice overseas? As to the revision of the tax code. It has been done before with some success. However, any positive effects and progress that was made, was negated by lobbyists and special interests. When they got their hands on it, it made things all the more complicated. I feel even these new systems will be subject to the lobbyists and special interests. Feel free to include other articles or research that are relevant to any of the three systems mentioned, or even a different plan someone has come up with.",
