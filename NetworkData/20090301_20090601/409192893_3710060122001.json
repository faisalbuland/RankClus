To be qualified you must: feel that the present federal regime is desirous of strpping Americans of their Constitutional rights. Do you value free speech as originally intended (that does not include porn) freedom to bare arms Napolitano is wrong in her tightening of HLS rules affecting vets etc. If you are for life of the unborn you are an enemy of this administration. This administration is weak re relationship with much of the rest of the world. Do you want immigration laws enforced? Hooraah for Joe Arpio and his work!!! in AZ Are you sick of paying for alien medical treatment? Amnesty is the wrong answer! In your opinion is the ACLU a socialist/ communist organization? Do You love the Word of God the Bible! Let's make it easy for the socialist regime to keep tabs on those who diagree with them and therefore are \"right-wing\" and dangerous to their agenda. Post yeah here or don't post at all if you are afraid of the consequences. IMHO I believe Obama was erroneous when apologizing to Europe. What was it for?? Our arrogance. Arrogance is in Europe as well Mr. President.",
