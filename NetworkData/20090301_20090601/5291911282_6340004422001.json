The Feds in D.C., along with the ACLU, said it would be a mistake. Hey, this is a conservative state, based on Christian values...! Guess what...We did it anyway. We recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal immigrants, and ship them back to where they came from unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. Hope we didn't send any of them to your state. This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU. They said it would be a mistake. Guess what.....we did it anyway. Yesterday, we passed a law to include DNA samples from any and all illegals to the Oklahoma database for criminal investigative purposes. Pelosi said it was unconstitutional. Guess what.....We did it anyway. Several weeks ago, we passed a law declaring Oklahoma as a Sovereign state, not under the Federal Government directives. That makes Oklahoma and Texas the only states to do so. Guess what.....More states are likely to follow. Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, both Carolina's, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, West Virginia, just to name a few. Should Mississippi act, so will Florida. Save your confederate money. It appears the South is about to rise up once again. The Federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I'm sure that was a set back for the Kennedys and Ms. Pelosi. Guess what.....We did it anyway. By the way, Obama does not like any of this. Guess what....we don't care....we're doing it anyway. GET YOUR STATE TO FOLLOW..Don't let the Federal Government walk on you. SEABEE'S \"CAN DO\", \"HAVE DONE\", AND WILL DO SO FOREVER. GOD BLESS AMERICA",

Democrats Phillip Steck of Colonie and Douglas Bullock of Albany are also sponsors. Steck said the measure is an \"effort to enforce an existing law and make sure it's complied with,\" referring to a state law governing ammunition sales. Before the hearing, protestors walked with signs in front of the Albany County Courthouse where the legislature chambers are, but they were not allowed to carry the signs into the courthouse. At the hearing were Albany Common Council President Shawn Morris and Council member Barbara Smith. Thomas Chandler of Guilderland accused legislators of using the law as a \"cheap way to exploit bigotry ... and stereotypes against the Second Amendment community.\" Bill Hart of Troy called it a feel-good law. \"It's as effective in stopping crime as a stop watch is in stopping time.\" Roger Barchitta of Colonie said it's \"back door registration.

The Feds in D.C., along with the ACLU, said it would be a mistake. Hey, this is a conservative state, based on Christian values...! Guess what...We did it anyway. We recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal immigrants, and ship them back to where they came from unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. Hope we didn't send any of them to your state. This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU. They said it would be a mistake. Guess what.....we did it anyway. Yesterday, we passed a law to include DNA samples from any and all illegals to the Oklahoma database for criminal investigative purposes. Pelosi said it was unconstitutional. Guess what.....We did it anyway. Several weeks ago, we passed a law declaring Oklahoma as a Sovereign state, not under the Federal Government directives. That makes Oklahoma and Texas the only states to do so. Guess what.....More states are likely to follow. Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, both Carolina's, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, West Virginia, just to name a few. Should Mississippi act, so will Florida. Save your confederate money. It appears the South is about to rise up once again. The Federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I'm sure that was a set back for the Kennedys and Ms. Pelosi. Guess what.....We did it anyway. By the way, Obama does not like any of this. Guess what....we don't care....we're doing it anyway. GET YOUR STATE TO FOLLOW..Don't let the Federal Government walk on you. What got lost somewhere in the mix is that the Constitution Was to regulate what the Federal Government could do, not the People.... About the only reach it was to have was to regulate actions between the States so that they would not create punitive trade laws against each other that might cause border disputes and civil war. The Constitution was NEVER supposed to reach into the States and force them to change or write laws on how they would govern themselves internally, beyond requiring them to have \"Democratic Republican\" forms of government. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were the first incursions into how States would write and enforce internal laws. No doubt slavery and it affects needs to be weeded out, but those three Amendments let the camal get his nose it the tent, and the Federal Government has been digging deeper and deeper into the States and into the individual lives of Americans - - Wandering and Wondering",
