I lost most of my right leg in Iraq and when I go to musters I have flash backs for weeks after. The real issue with musters is you have to give up your disability for a month or work for free and this not the same as the drilling reservist who chose this. I am not alone I know allot of vets in my boat and there a likely thousands of disabled vets in IRR. The worst part is career counselors who have also contacted members of my family and even met up with me at the VA until the VA cops told them to leave. Why has congress not addressed this?",

Does seem strange that they would have you report for IRR muster if you are missing part of a limb... ... considering the extent of the military's medical entrance exam ... (like the duck-walk, and stand on one foot tests.) May I suggest that you go to the main discussion board and look at the second section which is called Veteran's Section. In that area they have several sub-sections. I just saw one that is about disabled Vets. Post your question there and maybe someone can help you out.",
