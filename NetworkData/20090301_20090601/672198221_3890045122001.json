Reacting to injuries caused by over weighted body armor and security improvements in some combat zones, the Marine Corps is adjusting the way it equips Leathernecks in the field with personal protective equipment. The service is shifting the decision making down the chain of command and instituting a graduated armor scale in the coming weeks for the promise of a lighter load to reduce injuries and hopefully quicken the feet of Marines in the field. The first move, effective immediately, will push control to lieutenant colonels in deciding what amount of personal protective equipment Marines will wear for a given mission. \"Recognizing that body armor is modular and scalable, [we'll] try and leverage that by empowering our commanders \u2026 to make the appropriate decision with regards to what composition of body armor their Marines will wear,\" said Maj.
