I'm a proud American, I love my country and I've dreamed of serving her, her Constitution, and her Commander and Chief since I was a little boy. I'm also a Muslim, convert actually. I love my religion, consider myself devout, and also consider it one of the key reasons I want to serve. Ours is a nation which respects it's citizens rights, to amongst other things, practice any faith. We have within our government and armed forces a vast myriad of people, Muslim, Christian, Jew and otherwise...it's this picture of America that I love..that literally brings a tear to my eye, I **** you not. But I'm worried. People who supposedly share the same faith I do have taken American lives. Egregiously, and disgustingly. I know I will already have a hard enough time getting through Basic. I'm not a natural athlete, I'm out of shape, slow, flubby even, but have faith my will to succeed and desire to serve will give me the fortitude to overcome those things as I am sharpened into an instrument of our Army. But I fear ostracism because of my religion, and I am wondering, has anyone here been through basic with a Muslim? How was it for them? Are there any stories or personal experiences that might lay my fears to rest? In any case I am determined to move forward with my Military career, but I'd like to have a little something to go off of heading into basic. P.S. I posted this elsewhere, but this seemed a more appropriate place, so I reposted...should I delete the old topic? Thank you for your time!",

I can tell you there has been a change over the years in methods used in basic.

I think you'll find that, at least during basic, there won't be as much trouble from your peers about your chosen faith. Maybe later, when people have more time for this malarkey and have accustomed themselves to the discipline of being in the military so they know what they can get away with and what they can't. You'll get more of an a s s kicking (figuratively, mostly) about being out of shape than anything. Start now to work on your physical abilities... seriously. Go total green veggies and do push-ups until you can't do another one every few hours. You can easily make yourself ready in three months if you really mean it.

First of all, Asalaam Aleikum I just hit my three year mark as Muslim in the United States Air Force and I am already a decorated war veteran I have not faced any blatant ostracism because of my faith. As a matter of fact, in some cases, my being a Muslim was a welcome addition to my unit, and it got me about 15 seconds of fame while I was deployed to Iraq. The Air Force published a story about me online, and I was interviewed by a conservative radio show over the holidays while I was deployed. I've also been invited by the chaplains to participate in interfaith events, including the National Prayer day, which was attended by Colonels and Generals. Now, that's not to say that you won't encounter any ostracism or discrimination...there is still a lot of bigotry out there, even among our brothers and sisters in uniform. But take my advice (and I am not suggestiong that you would do these things or not)...don't flaunt your religion, because that gives off the wrong impression. Don't advertise it. If it comes up, it comes up. If you see or hear something offensive, speak up, but do it tactfully.

But not blatant. ... Now, that's not to say that you won't encounter any ostracism or discrimination...there is still a lot of bigotry out there, even among our brothers and sisters in uniform. But take my advice (and I am not suggestiong that you would do these things or not)...don't flaunt your lack of religion, because that gives off the wrong impression. Don't advertise it. If it comes up, it comes up. If you see or hear something offensive, speak up, but do it tactfully. You seem like you have a good head on your shoulders, so just do your job, learn your craft, serve your God and Country, and you will be just fine.", 
        "reply": "Good advice from Bsnizzle. I would have given a similar answer if you had asked about being an atheist in the military. ",
