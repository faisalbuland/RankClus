Trust me; when a decision is made to tell a client that a pet will not be allowed to board again, it is for the best. Was your cat injured, or was a staff member injured by your cat? With dogs, there's the destruction of property reason too, but I don't think that one applies to your kitty. Reasons for this occuring could be as simple as your calming and familiar voice was no longer there to make sense of it all for your cat. And then there are the obvious things like different sights, sounds, and smells. Noisy, echoing cages, strange/weird people, barking dogs, hissing cats, litterbox odors, attempts to catch the cat (if it tries to escape),and lack of routine happenings. I've also seen one instance where the staff wasn't very cat-friendly, so the decision was made to tell the client no more boarding their cat. I hope that's not the case for you, but even if it was, take note. The cause WILL present itself again if you board your cat there, and your cat doesn't need that. Sounds like a pet sitter is your best bet next time around",

Here is the issue. The vet is a long time friend, actually a relative(second cousin) and he informed me he could no longer board Smokey. He did give me a reason fortunately. It seems she became very aggitated and violent towards him and his employees. I understand that if that is the case he should not keep her. Now when I walked in to pick her up she came right to me, climbed into my arms, and purred as we went home. Having talked with the vet, and knowing him for so long I trust him without any doubt as to how he says the cat reacted. But he also was somewhat shocked at the cats change of behavior when I walked in compared to how she acted over the time she was there and says he has never seen such behavioral changes in any cat. I want to know if anyone else has had such an experience and what might cause it. Could be they were handling dogs, then coming to deal with the cats . . . not good . . . Critters trust their noses over what their eyes and ears are telling them every time - - Wandering and Wondering",
