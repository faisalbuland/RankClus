Many of these hard working people make 30, 40K, and when one considers taxes, or whom to tax - the question of disposable income is often ignored. quote: More in city spending half of pay on rent BY Michael Miller DAILY NEWS WRITER Tuesday, April 21st 2009, 4:00 AM More than one New Yorker in four spends half the family income on rent, with those in the outer boroughs digging deepest to pay their landlord. \"More and more New Yorkers are having to pay 50% of their income in rent,\" said Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn/ Queens), whose office conducted the survey. Weiner called the survey proof that \"New York is becoming more and more of a difficult place to live.\" According to the survey, 27.5% of New Yorkers, or 572,644 city residents, fork over half of their monthly paycheck for housing, up from 13% in 2002. Bronx residents have been hit the hardest, with more than 33% of residents spending half their cash on rent. For residents of Brooklyn and Queens, the number is about 28%. Incomes in the outer boroughs are falling, Weiner added, making it especially hard to meet the rising costs of living. While NYC leads the way in this, I have no doubt that this, to one degree or another, reflects the country as a whole. Now when I was a kid back in the fifties, the Middle Income Middle Class made enough money so that after necessities, they still had disposable income. Now the cost of necessities overwhelms us. So a working person would pay 2K for a car on an income of $200 a week, that same person is now making $1000 a week, but the car is almost 30K. This transference of wealth from working people to the rich continues unabated - So, while the wealthy now pay a much lower proportion of their income to Federal Taxes, working people pay a much HIGHER proportion of their income to State and Local taxes - and State taxes are always flat taxes.

Now if some guy is pulling down 100K, and claims all the deductions you name, he is STILL being shafter in terms of what he has left in disposable income. And I, single, 30K am really tired of being told that, \"after all Trump pays the same 7 percent as you do? What are YOU upset about?\" And Trump pays the same tolls as I do, the same sales tax as I do. And if he rode the subway, he pay the same fare as I do. We both have the same disposable income? The article I posted shows that the cost of living continues to decrease the standard of living of the Middle Income/Middle Class. Yet, even as that standard of living increases, so do the State flat taxes - Which hit who hardest? Trump? Well, Trump ain't the worst guy in the world. He says that he SHOULD be paying more in taxes. Maybe he knows something that you don't? And Warren Buffet, tells us that his secretary, when all is said and done, pays a higher proportion of HER income then he does? What's wrong with this picture? BTW - Rent control affects a relatively small part of rental housing in NYC. Still signifigant, but small. If it wasn't for rent control, my article would read considerably different. Dave",

In NYC 25 percent of the population that rent now pay more than 50 percent of their income just to put a roof over their homes. Many of these hard working people make 30, 40K, and when one considers taxes, or whom to tax - the question of disposable income is often ignored. quote: More in city spending half of pay on rent BY Michael Miller DAILY NEWS WRITER Tuesday, April 21st 2009, 4:00 AM More than one New Yorker in four spends half the family income on rent, with those in the outer boroughs digging deepest to pay their landlord. \"More and more New Yorkers are having to pay 50% of their income in rent,\" said Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn/ Queens), whose office conducted the survey. Weiner called the survey proof that \"New York is becoming more and more of a difficult place to live.\" According to the survey, 27.5% of New Yorkers, or 572,644 city residents, fork over half of their monthly paycheck for housing, up from 13% in 2002. Bronx residents have been hit the hardest, with more than 33% of residents spending half their cash on rent. For residents of Brooklyn and Queens, the number is about 28%. Incomes in the outer boroughs are falling, Weiner added, making it especially hard to meet the rising costs of living. While NYC leads the way in this, I have no doubt that this, to one degree or another, reflects the country as a whole. Now when I was a kid back in the fifties, the Middle Income Middle Class made enough money so that after necessities, they still had disposable income. Now the cost of necessities overwhelms us. So a working person would pay 2K for a car on an income of $200 a week, that same person is now making $1000 a week, but the car is almost 30K. This transference of wealth from working people to the rich continues unabated - So, while the wealthy now pay a much lower proportion of their income to Federal Taxes, working people pay a much HIGHER proportion of their income to State and Local taxes - and State taxes are always flat taxes. Dave and NYC also has some of the best rent control provisions I have ever heard of. State taxes are not flat, if you and I both make 40k, but I am allowed more deductions than you(more kids, blind, property taxes paid), yes we both pay 3% but I pay that on 18k net where you pay 3% on 35k. Yes years ago the tax rate on the upper folks was higher at one time it was 90%. But as my tax professor stated nearly every thing was deductable. While they have lowered the rate, the tax code does not allow nearly as many deductions. So the about the same amount or higher was collected. The US uses a progressive tax rate, so the concern for everybody is the marginal tax. this means how much will I be taxed on the next dollar earned. If you raise the rate on the upper level and some of those people decide they have enough money at level X, they may decline further salary to stay out of the next bracket. People just don't like to give above a certain amount to any government. If you lower the tax rate(Kennady, Reagan) the same people would take the extra salary even though they would pay more in taxes, they would take a greater percent home. Now both ways they would be taking more home with a raise, it is just one way they are not felling fleeced. Do you remember the song by George Harrison, The Tax Man. The lyrics had a line of \"thats 19 for me and 1 for you.\" He was being taxed at a rate of 95% by the UK government. While he and the other three were taking home a ton of money, do you think he wrote this song because he was happy with the rate.", 
        "reply": " Last time I checked, No One wants to pay taxes. Now if some guy is pulling down 100K, and claims all the deductions you name, he is STILL being shafter in terms of what he has left in disposable income. And I, single, 30K am really tired of being told that, \"after all Trump pays the same 7 percent as you do? What are YOU upset about?\" And Trump pays the same tolls as I do, the same sales tax as I do. And if he rode the subway, he pay the same fare as I do. We both have the same disposable income? The article I posted shows that the cost of living continues to decrease the standard of living of the Middle Income/Middle Class. Yet, even as that standard of living increases, so do the State flat taxes - Which hit who hardest? Trump? Well, Trump ain't the worst guy in the world. He says that he SHOULD be paying more in taxes. Maybe he knows something that you don't? And Warren Buffet, tells us that his secretary, when all is said and done, pays a higher proportion of HER income then he does? What's wrong with this picture? BTW - Rent control affects a relatively small part of rental housing in NYC. Still signifigant, but small. If it wasn't for rent control, my article would read considerably different. Dave",

He is a very smart business man, so he knows the common person would take offense at a super rich person paying a smaller percentage than a common worker, without truly understanding that income streams can be taxed different. The tax rates on the two income streams is very different. The secretary's income is from empoyment, taxed as ordinary income.

Washington was good at this) 1 that is 25% of federal liability 2 that limit tax to interest and dividends only. That leaves 34 states that have varying rates. Absolutes are hard to come by. Unless you are talking Vodka. Sorry, you haven't punched in the actual numbers. Having a one point or even a two point spread for those making 20K and those making a Billion is a flat tax - And WTF is this about taxing people who make an income of 10K? !!!!",

Many of these hard working people make 30, 40K, and when one considers taxes, or whom to tax - the question of disposable income is often ignored. quote: More in city spending half of pay on rent BY Michael Miller DAILY NEWS WRITER Tuesday, April 21st 2009, 4:00 AM More than one New Yorker in four spends half the family income on rent, with those in the outer boroughs digging deepest to pay their landlord. \"More and more New Yorkers are having to pay 50% of their income in rent,\" said Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn/ Queens), whose office conducted the survey. Weiner called the survey proof that \"New York is becoming more and more of a difficult place to live.\" According to the survey, 27.5% of New Yorkers, or 572,644 city residents, fork over half of their monthly paycheck for housing, up from 13% in 2002. Bronx residents have been hit the hardest, with more than 33% of residents spending half their cash on rent. For residents of Brooklyn and Queens, the number is about 28%. Incomes in the outer boroughs are falling, Weiner added, making it especially hard to meet the rising costs of living. While NYC leads the way in this, I have no doubt that this, to one degree or another, reflects the country as a whole. Now when I was a kid back in the fifties, the Middle Income Middle Class made enough money so that after necessities, they still had disposable income. Now the cost of necessities overwhelms us. So a working person would pay 2K for a car on an income of $200 a week, that same person is now making $1000 a week, but the car is almost 30K. This transference of wealth from working people to the rich continues unabated - So, while the wealthy now pay a much lower proportion of their income to Federal Taxes, working people pay a much HIGHER proportion of their income to State and Local taxes - and State taxes are always flat taxes.

Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn/ Queens), whose office conducted the survey. Weiner called the survey proof that \"New York is becoming more and more of a difficult place to live.\" According to the survey, 27.5% of New Yorkers, or 572,644 city residents, fork over half of their monthly paycheck for housing, up from 13% in 2002. Bronx residents have been hit the hardest, with more than 33% of residents spending half their cash on rent. For residents of Brooklyn and Queens, the number is about 28%. Incomes in the outer boroughs are falling, Weiner added, making it especially hard to meet the rising costs of living. While NYC leads the way in this, I have no doubt that this, to one degree or another, reflects the country as a whole. Now when I was a kid back in the fifties, the Middle Income Middle Class made enough money so that after necessities, they still had disposable income. Now the cost of necessities overwhelms us. So a working person would pay 2K for a car on an income of $200 a week, that same person is now making $1000 a week, but the car is almost 30K. This transference of wealth from working people to the rich continues unabated - So, while the wealthy now pay a much lower proportion of their income to Federal Taxes, working people pay a much HIGHER proportion of their income to State and Local taxes - and State taxes are always flat taxes. Dave and NYC also has some of the best rent control provisions I have ever heard of. State taxes are not flat, if you and I both make 40k, but I am allowed more deductions than you(more kids, blind, property taxes paid), yes we both pay 3% but I pay that on 18k net where you pay 3% on 35k. Yes years ago the tax rate on the upper folks was higher at one time it was 90%. But as my tax professor stated nearly every thing was deductable. While they have lowered the rate, the tax code does not allow nearly as many deductions. So the about the same amount or higher was collected. The US uses a progressive tax rate, so the concern for everybody is the marginal tax. this means how much will I be taxed on the next dollar earned. If you raise the rate on the upper level and some of those people decide they have enough money at level X, they may decline further salary to stay out of the next bracket. People just don't like to give above a certain amount to any government. If you lower the tax rate(Kennady, Reagan) the same people would take the extra salary even though they would pay more in taxes, they would take a greater percent home. Now both ways they would be taking more home with a raise, it is just one way they are not felling fleeced. Do you remember the song by George Harrison, The Tax Man. The lyrics had a line of \"thats 19 for me and 1 for you.\" He was being taxed at a rate of 95% by the UK government. While he and the other three were taking home a ton of money, do you think he wrote this song because he was happy with the rate. Last time I checked, No One wants to pay taxes. Now if some guy is pulling down 100K, and claims all the deductions you name, he is STILL being shafter in terms of what he has left in disposable income. And I, single, 30K am really tired of being told that, \"after all Trump pays the same 7 percent as you do? What are YOU upset about?\" And Trump pays the same tolls as I do, the same sales tax as I do. And if he rode the subway, he pay the same fare as I do. We both have the same disposable income? The article I posted shows that the cost of living continues to decrease the standard of living of the Middle Income/Middle Class. Yet, even as that standard of living increases, so do the State flat taxes - Which hit who hardest? Trump? Well, Trump ain't the worst guy in the world. He says that he SHOULD be paying more in taxes. Maybe he knows something that you don't? And Warren Buffet, tells us that his secretary, when all is said and done, pays a higher proportion of HER income then he does? What's wrong with this picture? BTW - Rent control affects a relatively small part of rental housing in NYC. Still signifigant, but small. If it wasn't for rent control, my article would read considerably different. Dave",

The tax rates on the two income streams is very different. The secretary's income is from empoyment, taxed as ordinary income. From his story where he said this, I think he used the rate of about 32% mol. Now if memory serves me Mr. Buffet's salary from Berkshire-Hathaway is $1 a year. He does have ordinary income from books he has authored. He may have some that comes from rental property, I am sure he receives speaking fees.

Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn/ Queens), whose office conducted the survey. Weiner called the survey proof that \"New York is becoming more and more of a difficult place to live.\" According to the survey, 27.5% of New Yorkers, or 572,644 city residents, fork over half of their monthly paycheck for housing, up from 13% in 2002. Bronx residents have been hit the hardest, with more than 33% of residents spending half their cash on rent. For residents of Brooklyn and Queens, the number is about 28%. Incomes in the outer boroughs are falling, Weiner added, making it especially hard to meet the rising costs of living. While NYC leads the way in this, I have no doubt that this, to one degree or another, reflects the country as a whole. Now when I was a kid back in the fifties, the Middle Income Middle Class made enough money so that after necessities, they still had disposable income. Now the cost of necessities overwhelms us. So a working person would pay 2K for a car on an income of $200 a week, that same person is now making $1000 a week, but the car is almost 30K. This transference of wealth from working people to the rich continues unabated - So, while the wealthy now pay a much lower proportion of their income to Federal Taxes, working people pay a much HIGHER proportion of their income to State and Local taxes - and State taxes are always flat taxes. Dave and NYC also has some of the best rent control provisions I have ever heard of. State taxes are not flat, if you and I both make 40k, but I am allowed more deductions than you(more kids, blind, property taxes paid), yes we both pay 3% but I pay that on 18k net where you pay 3% on 35k. Yes years ago the tax rate on the upper folks was higher at one time it was 90%. But as my tax professor stated nearly every thing was deductable. While they have lowered the rate, the tax code does not allow nearly as many deductions. So the about the same amount or higher was collected. The US uses a progressive tax rate, so the concern for everybody is the marginal tax. this means how much will I be taxed on the next dollar earned. If you raise the rate on the upper level and some of those people decide they have enough money at level X, they may decline further salary to stay out of the next bracket. People just don't like to give above a certain amount to any government. If you lower the tax rate(Kennady, Reagan) the same people would take the extra salary even though they would pay more in taxes, they would take a greater percent home. Now both ways they would be taking more home with a raise, it is just one way they are not felling fleeced. Do you remember the song by George Harrison, The Tax Man. The lyrics had a line of \"thats 19 for me and 1 for you.\" He was being taxed at a rate of 95% by the UK government.

Income from Capital gains isn't really income? Buffets a liar because he didn't bother to mention this? Dave Man you read alot into something without reading. I never said it was not income, just different. I never called him a liar, he omits a key fact on the difference of the income streams. He is a very smart business man, so he knows the common person would take offense at a super rich person paying a smaller percentage than a common worker, without truly understanding that income streams can be taxed different. The tax rates on the two income streams is very different. The secretary's income is from empoyment, taxed as ordinary income. From his story where he said this, I think he used the rate of about 32% mol. Now if memory serves me Mr. Buffet's salary from Berkshire-Hathaway is $1 a year. He does have ordinary income from books he has authored. He may have some that comes from rental property, I am sure he receives speaking fees. These are all taxed at about the same rate as his secretary. However the bulk, and I do mean the bulk of his income comes from investments and these are not treated as ordinary income. The top tax rate for capital gains is 15% and some are not subject to FEDERAL tax at all. So if he had none of the other income I mentioned earlier, just investment income equal to his secretary, he would have a smaller tax burden than her based on type of income. Gains from State and Local bonds are not subject to federal taxes. The lower tax rate does what it is intended to do stimulate investments. This not just what he said, but how he said it. Dave you are around my age so I am going to assume you have kids old enough for this to happen. Have they ever told you the truth ie; \"Dad I got the highest score on the math test out of anybody else in the class\". You would likely respond with a favorable comment. But now lets take this further, you later find out that your kid received a 24 out of 100 on that test. It was the highest in the class, but are you not feeling a bit different now with all the facts.",

I never called him a liar, he omits a key fact on the difference of the income streams. He is a very smart business man, so he knows the common person would take offense at a super rich person paying a smaller percentage than a common worker, without truly understanding that income streams can be taxed different. The tax rates on the two income streams is very different. The secretary's income is from empoyment, taxed as ordinary income. From his story where he said this, I think he used the rate of about 32% mol. Now if memory serves me Mr. Buffet's salary from Berkshire-Hathaway is $1 a year. He does have ordinary income from books he has authored. He may have some that comes from rental property, I am sure he receives speaking fees. These are all taxed at about the same rate as his secretary. However the bulk, and I do mean the bulk of his income comes from investments and these are not treated as ordinary income. The top tax rate for capital gains is 15% and some are not subject to FEDERAL tax at all. So if he had none of the other income I mentioned earlier, just investment income equal to his secretary, he would have a smaller tax burden than her based on type of income. Gains from State and Local bonds are not subject to federal taxes. The lower tax rate does what it is intended to do stimulate investments. This not just what he said, but how he said it. Dave you are around my age so I am going to assume you have kids old enough for this to happen. Have they ever told you the truth ie; \"Dad I got the highest score on the math test out of anybody else in the class\". You would likely respond with a favorable comment. But now lets take this further, you later find out that your kid received a 24 out of 100 on that test. It was the highest in the class, but are you not feeling a bit different now with all the facts.",

And it's part and parcel of NAFTA and the WTO, which also contribute to our relative drop in income. Dave",

All states have a flat rate? I just googled state tax rates and according to the tables published by the federal government, most states have a range, not a flat rate. New York is 4% to 6.85% There are (as of Jan 1, 2008) 6 states with a flat rate 7 states with no income tax (but probably tax the crap out of everything else. Washington was good at this) 1 that is 25% of federal liability 2 that limit tax to interest and dividends only. That leaves 34 states that have varying rates. Absolutes are hard to come by.

Income from Capital gains isn't really income? Buffets a liar because he didn't bother to mention this? Dave Man you read alot into something without reading. I never said it was not income, just different. I never called him a liar, he omits a key fact on the difference of the income streams. He is a very smart business man, so he knows the common person would take offense at a super rich person paying a smaller percentage than a common worker, without truly understanding that income streams can be taxed different. The tax rates on the two income streams is very different. The secretary's income is from empoyment, taxed as ordinary income. From his story where he said this, I think he used the rate of about 32% mol. Now if memory serves me Mr. Buffet's salary from Berkshire-Hathaway is $1 a year. He does have ordinary income from books he has authored. He may have some that comes from rental property, I am sure he receives speaking fees. These are all taxed at about the same rate as his secretary. However the bulk, and I do mean the bulk of his income comes from investments and these are not treated as ordinary income. The top tax rate for capital gains is 15% and some are not subject to FEDERAL tax at all. So if he had none of the other income I mentioned earlier, just investment income equal to his secretary, he would have a smaller tax burden than her based on type of income. Gains from State and Local bonds are not subject to federal taxes. The lower tax rate does what it is intended to do stimulate investments. This not just what he said, but how he said it. Dave you are around my age so I am going to assume you have kids old enough for this to happen. Have they ever told you the truth ie; \"Dad I got the highest score on the math test out of anybody else in the class\". You would likely respond with a favorable comment. But now lets take this further, you later find out that your kid received a 24 out of 100 on that test. It was the highest in the class, but are you not feeling a bit different now with all the facts.",
