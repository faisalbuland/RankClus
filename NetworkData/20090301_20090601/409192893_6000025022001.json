        "content": "Dear Senator Shelby: Thank you for your response to my letter concerning the outsourcing of AIDS-preventing condoms to China and Korea by USAID at the potential expense of 300 jobs at Alatech in Alabama. I expressed disappointment that this was happening even as the objective of Congress and the Administration (at the long term expense of the American taxpayer) is to preserve and increase jobs. I found this paragraph quoted from your response to be of particular interest. quote: I understand your concerns regarding the possibility of a USAID contract being awarded to a foreign company. Outsourcing contracts to foreign countries is often rooted in the fact that Americans tend to receive higher wages than workers in less prosperous nations. Many times foreign-based companies can offer cheaper products simply because wages are significantly lower in foreign nations. No sh*t, Sherlock? Brilliant! Whoever would have thunk it \u2013 perhaps you should surrender your seat and go teach economics at the University of Alabama. After carefully considering the quality of your response, the fact that you never addressed my clearly stated concern, and assuming you to be representative of the whole mass of congresscritters, I have come to the conclusion that we should outsource the entirety of the U.S. Congress to the low bidder. Undoubtedly we would get a better product at far less cost. Perhaps we could even get a quantity discount. Regards \u2013 A constituent and former supporter",
