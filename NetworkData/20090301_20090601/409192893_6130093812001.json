Leno asked the president whether the White House bowling alley had been \"burned and closed down\" in light of Obama's gutter ball embarrassment on the campaign trail last year. Obama replied, \"No, no. I have been practicing . . . I bowled a 129.\" The audience roared with laughter, and the late-night talk show host assured Obama \"that's very good, Mr. President.\" To which Obama interjected, \"It's like -- it was like Special Olympics, or something.\" The audience laughed. But the White House didn't let the comment linger without clarification. \"The president made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics,\" White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters flying aboard Air Force One after the taping of the show, according to a transcript released by the White House. \"He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world.\" Also on the \"Tonight Show,\" Leno asked the president when he would finally be making good on his famous campaign promise to reward his daughters with a puppy, which so far hasn't surfaced. \"Listen, this is Washington. That was a campaign promise,\" the president deadpanned to much laughter. The president said he was \"teasing,\" and explained that as soon as he returns from the NATO summit in France in Germany early next month, the \"dog will be in place.\" Leno asked if the dog would be a \"Portuguese Water Head,\" referencing first lady Michelle Obama's recent suggestion that the first family was leaning toward a Portuguese Water Dog. The president laughed and said, \"It's not a 'water head.' That sounds like a scary dog. Sort of dripping around the house.\" But the first dad gave absolutely no hints about what kind of dog - or puppy - it will be. \"We're going to get a dog that is -- that I think the girls will have a great time -- I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with it. You know, they say if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\" And according to the schedule the president described, his girls will have their new furry friend by Easter. I'd say his handling of the economy is sort of speical olympics like...",

Leno asked the president whether the White House bowling alley had been \"burned and closed down\" in light of Obama's gutter ball embarrassment on the campaign trail last year. Obama replied, \"No, no. I have been practicing . . . I bowled a 129.\" The audience roared with laughter, and the late-night talk show host assured Obama \"that's very good, Mr. President.\" To which Obama interjected, \"It's like -- it was like Special Olympics, or something.\" The audience laughed. But the White House didn't let the comment linger without clarification. \"The president made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics,\" White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters flying aboard Air Force One after the taping of the show, according to a transcript released by the White House. \"He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world.\" Also on the \"Tonight Show,\" Leno asked the president when he would finally be making good on his famous campaign promise to reward his daughters with a puppy, which so far hasn't surfaced. \"Listen, this is Washington. That was a campaign promise,\" the president deadpanned to much laughter. The president said he was \"teasing,\" and explained that as soon as he returns from the NATO summit in France in Germany early next month, the \"dog will be in place.\" Leno asked if the dog would be a \"Portuguese Water Head,\" referencing first lady Michelle Obama's recent suggestion that the first family was leaning toward a Portuguese Water Dog. The president laughed and said, \"It's not a 'water head.' That sounds like a scary dog. Sort of dripping around the house.\" But the first dad gave absolutely no hints about what kind of dog - or puppy - it will be. \"We're going to get a dog that is -- that I think the girls will have a great time -- I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with it. You know, they say if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\" And according to the schedule the president described, his girls will have their new furry friend by Easter. I'd say his handling of the economy is sort of speical olympics like...",
