US Troops for the most part, the vast majority of them are fine... Just another exaggerated problem, I don't but it. The stats speak for themselves. Suicides increase in direct proportion to deployments and repeated deployments increase financial, legal, family and romantic problems. If it's exaggerated the numbers should stay constant but they rise as the war goes on which means increased deployments per unit, and per Soldier. This is the first time the 101st had to stand down to deal with suicides and that includes WWII, Korea and Nam. You might want to argue that Iraq is a different kind of war but any vet of any era would argue that his was a different kind of war also. The main difference I see is the repeated deployments. Consider this: The average infantryman in the South Pacific during World War II saw about 40 days of combat in four years. The average infantryman in Vietnam saw about 240 days of combat in one year thanks to the mobility of the helicopter. The WWII Doggie spent more time on line but Nam Grunts fought hard for turf that had to be abandoned and retaken multiple times because we dribbled in force levels instead of going in hard and heavy from the jump. Sound familiar? I don't know the stats for the OIF Grunts but due to the smaller force levels and increased mobility, I'll bet their combat ratios will be off the chain. That has to have an effect.

There is a huge difference between being stressed and being an emotional wreck. The military is being stressed by the high opstempo. That's why the army had to institute stop-loss to keep people from getting out when their period of service ended. That's why the various branches have had increased (now coming back down) reenlistment bonuses for some high demand/low density career fields. That's why the army was issuing waivers to let felons enlist. That's why the army has had to call up not just guardsmen and reservists, but people from the IRR. How was the individual ready reserve explained to me? \"You only have to worry about that if the Russians invade the United States and we're gonna draft everyone anyway.\" I agree with what I think you're saying in that those who commit suicide are way outside the norm. But I also think that it is indicative of the stresses being put on the same people over and over again. Liberal myth? How could you possibly come to the conclusion that the military isn't stressed? The military has been significantly down-sized since the Cold War ended. Even before the 9/11 attacks, our military was facing an increased operations tempo with a reduced force. The air force has been running constant combat operations over Iraq since 1991. We're almost at the 18 year point now, although I will say that the opstempo and footprint have obviously both significantly increased since the attacks. Since we didn't have the numbers over our prospective adversaries, our military concentrated quality over quantity. Both in equipment and in personnel. We have been geared up not for long, drawn out combat operations, but for a quick and decisive victory from the outset of a war. That isn't the situation that we've been facing for the last seven years. Forget the 18 years. For the last 7 years we've been fighting a war that isn't the kind of war our military is designed to fight, and we've been doing it with budgets and personnel both reduced by the \"peace dividend\" since we won the Cold War.

        "reply": " There is a huge difference between being stressed and being an emotional wreck. The military is being stressed by the high opstempo. That's why the army had to institute stop-loss to keep people from getting out when their period of service ended. That's why the various branches have had increased (now coming back down) reenlistment bonuses for some high demand/low density career fields. That's why the army was issuing waivers to let felons enlist. That's why the army has had to call up not just guardsmen and reservists, but people from the IRR. How was the individual ready reserve explained to me? \"You only have to worry about that if the Russians invade the United States and we're gonna draft everyone anyway.\" I agree with what I think you're saying in that those who commit suicide are way outside the norm. But I also think that it is indicative of the stresses being put on the same people over and over again. Liberal myth? How could you possibly come to the conclusion that the military isn't stressed? The military has been significantly down-sized since the Cold War ended. Even before the 9/11 attacks, our military was facing an increased operations tempo with a reduced force. The air force has been running constant combat operations over Iraq since 1991. We're almost at the 18 year point now, although I will say that the opstempo and footprint have obviously both significantly increased since the attacks. Since we didn't have the numbers over our prospective adversaries, our military concentrated quality over quantity. Both in equipment and in personnel. We have been geared up not for long, drawn out combat operations, but for a quick and decisive victory from the outset of a war. That isn't the situation that we've been facing for the last seven years. Forget the 18 years. For the last 7 years we've been fighting a war that isn't the kind of war our military is designed to fight, and we've been doing it with budgets and personnel both reduced by the \"peace dividend\" since we won the Cold War. This is not a statement one way or the other about the justness of the war or whether or not we should have gone in. It's just a statement of the realities that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have to face. The military is not broken, but it certainly is stressed.",

This war has no light at the end of the tunnel and causes many hardships for these war weary vets. So IMHO that could very well be the reason for the higher than normal incidents of depression and hence the suicides. So yes it is a very serious military problem, and is not a military force ready to take on three or four fronts.

US Troops for the most part, the vast majority of them are fine... Just another exaggerated problem, I don't but it. The stats speak for themselves. Suicides increase in direct proportion to deployments and repeated deployments increase financial, legal, family and romantic problems. If it's exaggerated the numbers should stay constant but they rise as the war goes on which means increased deployments per unit, and per Soldier. This is the first time the 101st had to stand down to deal with suicides and that includes WWII, Korea and Nam. You might want to argue that Iraq is a different kind of war but any vet of any era would argue that his was a different kind of war also. The main difference I see is the repeated deployments. Consider this: The average infantryman in the South Pacific during World War II saw about 40 days of combat in four years. The average infantryman in Vietnam saw about 240 days of combat in one year thanks to the mobility of the helicopter. The WWII Doggie spent more time on line but Nam Grunts fought hard for turf that had to be abandoned and retaken multiple times because we dribbled in force levels instead of going in hard and heavy from the jump. Sound familiar? I don't know the stats for the OIF Grunts but due to the smaller force levels and increased mobility, I'll bet their combat ratios will be off the chain. That has to have an effect.

There is a huge difference between being stressed and being an emotional wreck. The military is being stressed by the high opstempo. That's why the army had to institute stop-loss to keep people from getting out when their period of service ended. That's why the various branches have had increased (now coming back down) reenlistment bonuses for some high demand/low density career fields. That's why the army was issuing waivers to let felons enlist. That's why the army has had to call up not just guardsmen and reservists, but people from the IRR. How was the individual ready reserve explained to me? \"You only have to worry about that if the Russians invade the United States and we're gonna draft everyone anyway.\" I agree with what I think you're saying in that those who commit suicide are way outside the norm. But I also think that it is indicative of the stresses being put on the same people over and over again. Liberal myth? How could you possibly come to the conclusion that the military isn't stressed? The military has been significantly down-sized since the Cold War ended. Even before the 9/11 attacks, our military was facing an increased operations tempo with a reduced force. The air force has been running constant combat operations over Iraq since 1991. We're almost at the 18 year point now, although I will say that the opstempo and footprint have obviously both significantly increased since the attacks. Since we didn't have the numbers over our prospective adversaries, our military concentrated quality over quantity. Both in equipment and in personnel. We have been geared up not for long, drawn out combat operations, but for a quick and decisive victory from the outset of a war. That isn't the situation that we've been facing for the last seven years. Forget the 18 years. For the last 7 years we've been fighting a war that isn't the kind of war our military is designed to fight, and we've been doing it with budgets and personnel both reduced by the \"peace dividend\" since we won the Cold War. This is not a statement one way or the other about the justness of the war or whether or not we should have gone in. It's just a statement of the realities that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have to face. The military is not broken, but it certainly is stressed.",

Yeah but what they aren't telling you is why those relationships failed (Soldier isn't home anyway spouse is thinking why am I married/involved with dating someone I rarely see). Financial issues again hard to pay bills when deployed, then come back get caught up, deploy again, etc.",

Irwin, the Army officially recognizes suicide as a problem right now. Anyone's who currently in can tell you about all the training we're being put through now. Suicide has a great impact on units. Remember that we often train and serve together for years at a time now - my platoon spent nearly four years together, 27 months total in Iraq, and we went to the same schools for two years before hitting our unit. And you know how close military relationships can become. If one of us had committed suicide at any point, we would have been devastated. It would have seriously impacted our ability to accomplish our mission, and my platoon was the only one who did what did in the entire 4,000 man unit. And really, not every suicidal person even gives much warning. So the Army is rightly worried. It's not always \"relationship issues\" like you might think. That category includes the death of loved ones. My father and both grandfathers died during the months before I shipped out for second tour. I had no down time to even process grief, just 12 hour days seven days a week, under intense pressure. I'll be honest, that nearly made me crazy, in a bad way. Wasn't quite suicidal, but I lost all perspective and all hope, I can easily see why some people would consider suicide. You can only push someone so far... Fortunately my leadership had the sense to insist that those of us who needed it go and get help.",

Improvements to be made: 1) Better screening on the front end. 2) Better screening during initial training. 3) Watch over the guy next to you. 4) Not ignoring warning signs.

I heard it was only 11 rather than 26 but something is very, very wrong with the All Volunteer Military. You can't send the same guys in harm's way over and over while the rest of America lives a normal life. This is the inherent weakness of constantly reusing only a small percentage of available manpower. I have always favored a standing draft through peacetime and wartime for this very reason. I totally agree with that opinion. The volunteer military attracts a specific segment of people than would a draft representing a true cross section of the population just doing thier civic duty with a light at the end of the tunnel. Many Volunteers come in for the long haul with a good Job, benefits, and early retirement. Fact is when there is no war its a lucrative Job and in many cases better than the private sector could provide these specific individuals. This war has no light at the end of the tunnel and causes many hardships for these war weary vets. So IMHO that could very well be the reason for the higher than normal incidents of depression and hence the suicides. So yes it is a very serious military problem, and is not a military force ready to take on three or four fronts. The troops have been over extended and are tired after 7-8 years of multiple deployments. Relief in the form of conscription is badly needed and will be the ultimate solution any way if we are to continue on this war footing.",
