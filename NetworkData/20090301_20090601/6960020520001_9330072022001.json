I don't have an e-mail address for Luttrell but you can leave a comment which he can read. He can use everyone's support. Luttrell is retired Navy SEAL who was the only survivor when his entire unit was wiped out in Afghanistan in 2005. Luttrell was seriously wounded and just had additional surgery for his wounds. He lives out in the country near Houston where he takes care of his elderly mother. He was given a dog, a Labrador Retriever, to help him deal with the loss of his unit. He named the dog DASY, a combination of the first letters of his lost comrades' names. He heard a gunshot and ran to check on his mother, who was fine. He then ran outside and found DASY dead of a bullet wound. He grabbed his 9mm pistol, crawled under a fence and was prepared to take out the four guys who had been involved in killing his beloved dog. He took aim, doing what he was trained to do, but could not bring himself to fire. Instead he chased them in his pick-up for 40 miles until the local police caught up with them. These four sub-humans don't realize how lucky they were that Luttrell is a decent human being. Two were arrested and charged with shooting the dog. The other two were charged with minor offenses. The four may have been involved in other senseless shootings of animals in the area. There is a picture of DASY. She was beautiful. Luttrell has suffered more loss than anyone should have to deal with. Please go to www.chron.com and read and e-mail the article to others you know.
