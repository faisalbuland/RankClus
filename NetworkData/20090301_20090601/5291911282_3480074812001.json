I'm curious about contract cancellation charges as they apply to military personnel. If I am deployed overseas for a substantial length, such as 1 year, can I suspend or cancel a phone contract without incurring hundreds of dollars in fees? Will phone service providers honor a copy of my deployment orders from the CO?",

I have T-mobile which is a German company and it is pretty common in the Middle East and Asia. So, I just got different SIM cards for the different countries I was in and used my phone whenever I was near shore or was on Liberty. I just shortened my minutes on my plan during deployment to save about $20 a month. The phone bill wasn't too much of a burden considering cell phone plans are pretty cheap and I was one of only two or three people that didn't have to rely on phone cards and the like. So, it was worth keeping it active. But, you are just shipping to basic anyway. I don't see any reason to cancel and pay $250 in cancellation charges. Call them and either put yourself on the cheapest plan that they offer or ask to see if they will suspend your charges while you are in training. Remember, basic is only a couple months. So, you will probably want a phone as soon as you are done.",

There was no limit on this, I told them I reckoned I'd be fifteen months, they said to just give them a call when I got back (my phone would still work to call them even while suspended.) They even let me turn it on for mid-tour leave, and then re-suspend it. Plus my phone is triband, and I asked to have it unlocked recently. Now it will work most anywhere that has GSM cell phone service. T-Mobile's generally been very helpful, and I've been with them for five years now. They bought my loyalty for good with that easy suspension option. So many of my friends had issues with their phone service while deployed.",
