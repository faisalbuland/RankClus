What makes you think that the Uganda people are going to do the job they are paid to do. Why are not Army, Marine, Air Force and Navy guarding their own bases? So we are now employing mercenaries. There is no other name that can be used to describe them. I find that this does'nt speak very highly of our capablities to protect ourselves.",
