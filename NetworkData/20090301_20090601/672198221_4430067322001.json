Is this really helping or just smoke screens. I dunno. I drive 10K a year, and at the above rate that costs me $1125 a year. If I was getting forty MPG, I would pay $550 a year, meaning that after 30K I would break even on costs, and the rest would be gravy. Now my car gets 20MPG, if I was driving one of those 15MPG SUV's, my savings would occur a lot sooner. And mind you, this would also be one way of holding down future increases in the cost of gasoline, which doesn't even figure into the equation. Might as well wish for the return of the \"Good Old Days,\" where a big Caddy got 3MPG... Dave",

Before anyone bring up the tax issue what is being proposed by some is shifting payment for road infrastructure from part fuel and road use tax and part (majority at Fed and I think also at state) general fund tax revenue to a larger percent from usage taxes and fees (fuel, road tax, etc.) so USERS pay more of the cost for transportation infrastructure.
