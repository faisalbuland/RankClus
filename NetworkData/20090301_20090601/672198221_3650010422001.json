If this were a republican there'd be OUTRAGE from the democratic side of the fence, looking for blood. Personally I believe the Speaker should not be given a pass by her own party, or anywhere for that matter, without coming forward with \"something\" to substaniate her claims, pro or con........ but the dems are trying to bury this and we see the hole already dug by her statement this morning. She's obviously forgotten who she works for. She also doesn't have the right to NOT take and answer questions. She must be afraid she will tell another lie. The people will not forget this. BTW, here's her web site. There's a 'contact us' tab at the top of the page. \"http://speaker.house.gov/\" You are right, she has forgotten who she works for. And unfortunately her constituents have forgotten not to re-elect her. Shame on them. Ms Pelosi, in fact, stated that her primary job was to help more democrats get re-elected. Ms P could obviously be the poster child for term limits.",
