Looking back 50 years, global warming periods preceded CO2 increases by 9 months according to Dr. Allen M.R. McRae. CO2 emissions due to human activity rose gradually from the onset of the Industrial Revolution, reaching 1 billion tonnes per year (expressed as carbon) by 1945, and then accelerated to 9 billion tonnes per year by 2007. Since 1945 when CO2 emissions accelerated, Earth experienced 22 years of warming, and 40 years of either cooling or absence of warming. 3. CO2 has the ability to raise temperatures - but not by much. The reason is that CO2 is logarithmic - meaning each unit of CO2 emitted has less ability to heat than the preceding unit. In fact, the first 20ppm of CO2 has more heating capacity than the next 400ppm. 4. Scientists from the IPCC, Canada, Russia, the United States and other countries now believe because of solar inactivity we are entering a global cooling period. This will challenge nations around the globe to keep their populations warm which takes even more energy (note: China is currently suffering through its worst winter in 100 years). I believe, however, that we must move away from fossil fuels in the short term for nation security reasons (stop the dependence on foreign oil). I believe in the long term we will move from the more efficient and cost effective fossil fuels to, for the first time in our history, less efficient and more costly renewable energy sources (nuclear, wind, solar) because fossil fuels are a finite resource.
