Par for the course, civilian casualties far exceed government or militant losses. Hammered by government air, artillery and direct fire during protracted curfew periods, civilians are punished, as well, by increasingly suspicious and desperate militant forces. Surviving refugees are atarting to fill hospitals at further remove from fighting areas. They bring their stories with them, and these are being picked up by media outside the blacked-out operational areas. Any guesses on who'll wear the blame for this? This message has been edited.

Government forces are poorly prepared to conduct CI/CT operations against the Taliban in large part because they have been overly focused on the conventional threat from India.",
