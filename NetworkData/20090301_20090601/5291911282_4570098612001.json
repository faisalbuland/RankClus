        "content": "I am a writer doing an article on the benefits of having family by the side of our wounded servicemen and women as they undergo rehabilitation. This article is also specifically addressing the need for more accessible temporary housing for the veterans and their families to stay at. The two types of interviewees we are seeking are: 1) An injured veteran that was not able to have his/her spouse and/or children with them during important rehabilitation processes because housing was not available or it would have caused severe financial strain on the family. 2) Injured veteran who did have to pay out of pocket to have their family close by during rehabilitation, thereby causing additional stress and/or financial hardship. I am interested in the perspectives of both the servicemembers and the spouse (if interested in participating). Interested interviewees should be from the current OEF/OIF conflicts and medically retired. This article will be for a national magazine with combined print and online readership of approx. 1,000,000 people. Please note that this article is not intended to blast any branch of government or service provider, simple to address a need that exists and hopefully stir more Americans to support their returning military, specifically those who have sustained injuries. If you are interested in being considered, please email a brief explanation of your all emils must be conducted through the members' profile page SEND option] Interviews will be conducted over the next few days. Thank you for your service. This message has been edited. Last edited by: OldArmyWOPA, Wed 04 March 2009 12:50 PM",

Just my opinion back then but I sure as heck didn't want my sons flying down from NH to FL to see me in that condition. It would have been very hard for them. Back then my sons were 17 and 10. Instead, I talked to them on the phone very often and kept them updated on how I was doing. My parents, brothers and sister came down though and were a great source of support. Again, just to clarify, this was all under the Federal OWCP and not the VA system. Don P.S. a mod will come along and delete your website. You can't post them here. Just have people send you an email through your profile page.",

You'll probably find some folks who are willing to go along with your predetermined line of thought. More will not, because the military is doing a great deal to put wounded/injured/ill servicemembers in a place near family where they can recover, or is bringing family to them - at considerable taxpayer cost, and with considerable private funding. Just out of curiosity, have you even been to Fort Sam Houston, Balboa (San Diego) Naval Hospital, or Walter Reed Army Medical Center? Have you checked out the Wounded Warrior programs run by the Marines and the Army? Sorry, I don't buy your \"we bear no ill will\" line ...",
