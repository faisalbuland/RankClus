It WILL bite you in the azz later, esp if you need a secuirty clearance. You can also post your question here Joining the military Off the top of my head, IF you've served your time and paid your fines, you SHOULD be OK. BUTTTTT because it was a DUI, I don't know for sure. Good Luck, sounds like you worked hard for it. BUT for the love of God, Let this be a lesson, you stand to LOOSE alot on one boneheaded moment. The stakes are ALOT higher when your fellow Marines count on you to coner thier azzws!",
