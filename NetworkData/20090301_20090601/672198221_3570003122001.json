I often choose the side of Dems just because it's a bit more in line with some things I believe in, which is don't try to fill a kettle up with ***t and then try to get people to believe it's chocolate pudding.",

Liberals are concerned about jobs for US citizens and jobs leaving being shipped oveseas. Lberals are concerned abou providing universal health care, and for a good education for their kids, a strong military and defense of our nation, and for lowering taxes for 90+% of all Americans, etc-etc. Funny, it's where the liberals are in control (IE Chicago, DC, etc) that the strongest anti-gun laws are in place. Care to explain that? Can't speak for Chicago, I don't live there, but I would assume it would have something to do with law enforcement and Chicago's high crime rate, and law enforcement controlling crime. Why? You have something against peace officers enforcing the law, or you like making things hard on them? I live in Illinois and Chitown has and continues to try to control the whole state. Any gun laws for Chitown alone is passed by the mayor and his cronies who are all democrats. When the assult gun ban was lifted, Chitown passed their own ban. Chitown last year or the year before banned shotguns, they considered shotgun assult weapons. All legitiment hunters with registered shotguns had to remove them from the city limits or turn them in. You like gun laws, come live in this fecked up state. Be ruled by Chitown and see how you like it. So what's your plan? You want to go running around Chicago waving a weapon around? That's ahgainst the law damn near everywhere. Just what is it you 2nd Amendment types want anyway? Last I heard, nobody in government is looking to take your right to bear arms away. This Illinois law doesn't say you cannot own a firearm, just that you can't go packing one around town unless you have a permit to do so. \"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.\" - T.
