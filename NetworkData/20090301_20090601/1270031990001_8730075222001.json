Last year, when a similar measure was introduced, 93 members of the House of Representatives co-sponsored this legislation.

I believe I HAVE a clue as to the background and context to the scripture reducedtension cited. I can't speak for reducedtension's bonifides as a Biblical scholar, but I believe that reducedtension's interpretation of Matthew 6:5-6 is an accurate, Biblical interpretation of Jesus's teaching on public, \"Look at me - I'm holier than you are\" prayer. Jesus considered such public prayer the act of a hypocrite, a poser and a Pharisee. As Jesus said in Matthew 23: quote: [1] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, [2] Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: [3] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. [4] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. [5] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, [6] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, [7] And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. [14] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. [15] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. [27] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. [28] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. There was One perfect man. Bk. of James ..... and I will show you my faith by my works. I am familiar with the works of the people we as Christians are to stand with in the work of Christ. Rather than join forces with the \"intellectual higher critics\" of \"the once for all delivered to the saints faith\" be an apolegetic for those who have the where-with-all to stand in the gap and take the insults and criticism of these \"half baked\" Bible scholars who often times have reasoned themselves away from what they once believed and thereby were never true believers to begin with. It matters little to me if you speak 100 languages and have read 30 translations of the Word I believe the above is still applicable. The scriptures you site are more than likely to be applied to all men at some time or other in their walk on the earth. If they were never applicable to you than hats off but not very likely. good week end.",

Here's a good place to start finding out about the lies of David Barton. I have some of his literature here that I picked up in an Army Chapel that hosted him as he went 'thumping' for Mike Huckabee in violation of DoD policy. The Chapel \"guards\" were very suspicious of why I wanted the literature. It was hidden away in an office... they knew what they were up to. They called someone to see if they should give it to me. They let me take my pick. It was very 'tainted'! But here it is, don't let the name of the site derail you. \"http://www.liarsforjesus.com/downloads/LFJ_chap_1.pdf There are a number of problems with Barton's view of history and his relationship with the military and it's getting looked into.

Jesus considered such public prayer the act of a hypocrite, a poser and a Pharisee. As Jesus said in Matthew 23: quote: [1] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, [2] Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: [3] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. [4] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. [5] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, [6] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, [7] And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. [14] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. [15] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. [27] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. [28] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. There was One perfect man. Bk. of James ..... and I will show you my faith by my works. I am familiar with the works of the people we as Christians are to stand with in the work of Christ. Rather than join forces with the \"intellectual higher critics\" of \"the once for all delivered to the saints faith\" be an apolegetic for those who have the where-with-all to stand in the gap and take the insults and criticism of these \"half baked\" Bible scholars who often times have reasoned themselves away from what they once believed and thereby were never true believers to begin with.

You do realize that just because another human mouths nice sounding stuff about God does not make any g*d real? Nice ideas abound... many are directed to various kind of unseen being ideas. Do they work? Probably not. Do they help people feel good about their nation, themselves and all. Sure. That's civil religion, always sounds good and right. What does that all mean? That someone up their loves you? That no harm will be fall you? Even if GW was a believer (which I do not believe he was) all his mouthing prayers, and those of the ones who were probably believers, didn't stop the Civil War, depression, and so on. S h i i t still happen, thousands have suffered in spite of any pleading to the unseen gods.

The next time someone tells you that politicians shouldn't talk about religion, or the \"Almighty God\", just show them this: Washington's 1789 Thanksgiving Day Proclamation: WHEREAS it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favour; and Whereas both Houses of Congress have, by their joint committee, requested me \"to recommend to the people of the United States a DAY OF PUBLICK THANSGIVING and PRAYER, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness:\" NOW THEREFORE, I do recommend and assign THURSDAY, the TWENTY-SIXTH DAY of NOVEMBER next, to be devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then all unite in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to their becoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of His providence in the course and conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty which we have since enjoyed;-- for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enable to establish Constitutions of government for our sasety and happiness, and particularly the national one now lately instituted;-- for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge;-- and, in general, for all the great and various favours which He has been pleased to confer upon us. And also, that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions;-- to enable us all, whether in publick or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us); and to bless them with good governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and us; and, generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best. GIVEN under my hand, at the city of New-York, the third day of October, in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine. (signed) G. Washington Any religious person of good standing in this country would show much courage by standing up in agreement with this good man, any time, any place, in the face of any harassing foe, and under any circumstance...", 
        "reply": " You do realize that just because another human mouths nice sounding stuff about God does not make any g*d real? Nice ideas abound... many are directed to various kind of unseen being ideas. Do they work? Probably not. Do they help people feel good about their nation, themselves and all. Sure. That's civil religion, always sounds good and right. What does that all mean? That someone up their loves you? That no harm will be fall you? Even if GW was a believer (which I do not believe he was) all his mouthing prayers, and those of the ones who were probably believers, didn't stop the Civil War, depression, and so on. S h i i t still happen, thousands have suffered in spite of any pleading to the unseen gods. But eventually, where needed, might made right... humans wrestled the god talk right out of the hands of god and did what ever it was they thought they needed to do.. and usually did it in the name of a god, especially if they won.

I have studied the Bible in various translations, to include the King James Version, the Revised Standard version, the Jerusalem Bible and Martin Luther's translation of the Bible into German (I am bi-lingual in English and German). My late father was a graduate of Eastern Baptist Seminary and an ordained minister of the American Baptist Convention. I believe I HAVE a clue as to the background and context to the scripture reducedtension cited. I can't speak for reducedtension's bonifides as a Biblical scholar, but I believe that reducedtension's interpretation of Matthew 6:5-6 is an accurate, Biblical interpretation of Jesus's teaching on public, \"Look at me - I'm holier than you are\" prayer. Jesus considered such public prayer the act of a hypocrite, a poser and a Pharisee. As Jesus said in Matthew 23: quote: [1] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, [2] Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: [3] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. [4] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. [5] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, [6] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, [7] And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. [14] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. [15] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. [27] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. [28] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Fightdirector, Sat 09 May 2009 02:54 AM",

Jesus considered such public prayer the act of a hypocrite, a poser and a Pharisee. As Jesus said in Matthew 23: quote: [1] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, [2] Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: [3] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. [4] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. [5] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, [6] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, [7] And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. [14] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. [15] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. [27] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. [28] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Fightdirector, Sat 09 May 2009 02:54 AM",

The next time someone tells you that politicians shouldn't talk about religion, or the \"Almighty God\", just show them this: Washington's 1789 Thanksgiving Day Proclamation: WHEREAS it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favour; and Whereas both Houses of Congress have, by their joint committee, requested me \"to recommend to the people of the United States a DAY OF PUBLICK THANSGIVING and PRAYER, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness:\" NOW THEREFORE, I do recommend and assign THURSDAY, the TWENTY-SIXTH DAY of NOVEMBER next, to be devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then all unite in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to their becoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of His providence in the course and conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty which we have since enjoyed;-- for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enable to establish Constitutions of government for our sasety and happiness, and particularly the national one now lately instituted;-- for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge;-- and, in general, for all the great and various favours which He has been pleased to confer upon us. And also, that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions;-- to enable us all, whether in publick or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us); and to bless them with good governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and us; and, generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best. GIVEN under my hand, at the city of New-York, the third day of October, in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine. (signed) G. Washington Any religious person of good standing in this country would show much courage by standing up in agreement with this good man, any time, any place, in the face of any harassing foe, and under any circumstance... You do realize that just because another human mouths nice sounding stuff about God does not make any g*d real? Nice ideas abound... many are directed to various kind of unseen being ideas. Do they work? Probably not. Do they help people feel good about their nation, themselves and all. Sure. That's civil religion, always sounds good and right. What does that all mean? That someone up their loves you? That no harm will be fall you? Even if GW was a believer (which I do not believe he was) all his mouthing prayers, and those of the ones who were probably believers, didn't stop the Civil War, depression, and so on. S h i i t still happen, thousands have suffered in spite of any pleading to the unseen gods. But eventually, where needed, might made right... humans wrestled the god talk right out of the hands of god and did what ever it was they thought they needed to do.. and usually did it in the name of a god, especially if they won. Since when has more 'god talk' made things really better? Now, with BHO in office? Would he be there because god finally answered prayer? Even George Washington's?",

Jesus considered such public prayer the act of a hypocrite, a poser and a Pharisee. As Jesus said in Matthew 23: quote: [1] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, [2] Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: [3] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. [4] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. [5] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, [6] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, [7] And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. [14] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. [15] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. [27] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. [28] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. This message has been edited. Last edited by: Fightdirector, Sat 09 May 2009 02:54 AM",

And also, that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions;-- to enable us all, whether in publick or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us); and to bless them with good governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and us; and, generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

You do realize that just because another human mouths nice sounding stuff about God does not make any g*d real? Nice ideas abound... many are directed to various kind of unseen being ideas. Do they work? Probably not. Do they help people feel good about their nation, themselves and all. Sure. That's civil religion, always sounds good and right. What does that all mean? That someone up their loves you? That no harm will be fall you? Even if GW was a believer (which I do not believe he was) all his mouthing prayers, and those of the ones who were probably believers, didn't stop the Civil War, depression, and so on. S h i i t still happen, thousands have suffered in spite of any pleading to the unseen gods. But eventually, where needed, might made right... humans wrestled the god talk right out of the hands of god and did what ever it was they thought they needed to do.. and usually did it in the name of a god, especially if they won. Since when has more 'god talk' made things really better? Now, with BHO in office? Would he be there because god finally answered prayer? Even George Washington's?",
