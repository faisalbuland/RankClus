As men, we tend to identifiy ourselves by what we do for a living, unlike women who identify themselves by their relationships, and when we are no longer doing anything of value, we come to the erroneous conclusion that we have no value either. That almost inevitably leads to a slow, incremental loss of the will to live. I believe we can will ourselves into the grave if we're not careful. So, what to do about that? Get out and get involved in others peoples lives. Not directly by going next door and telling your neighbor how to live his life, but through charitable work which interests you. Retirement is a great time to take an inventory of yourself and, if you do it honestly, you'll find that you have interests and skills which you never knew you had or which you put on the back burner through your working life. At least, that's how it worked for me. I found that I could paint, for instance. That's a skill I never knew I had and enjoyed putting brush to canvas. Eventually, I found my way into disaster relief with the Southern Baptist's and that's given me a whole new identity, a whole new focus and it's been the best thing which ever happened to me. Yes, I'm still physically able to do that, but there are many, many who do it alongside me who are disabled. Even some in wheelchairs or really advanced age. They can be found doing administrative work or even something as simple as handing out bottles of water at a feeding unit. The point is that no matter the disability or the restricitions we find ourselves working with in old age, we can still find some useful work to do IF we're looking and IF we don't just sit down and amuse ourselves until we die.",

As men, we tend to identifiy ourselves by what we do for a living, unlike women who identify themselves by their relationships, and when we are no longer doing anything of value, we come to the erroneous conclusion that we have no value either. That almost inevitably leads to a slow, incremental loss of the will to live. I believe we can will ourselves into the grave if we're not careful. So, what to do about that? Get out and get involved in others peoples lives. Not directly by going next door and telling your neighbor how to live his life, but through charitable work which interests you. Retirement is a great time to take an inventory of yourself and, if you do it honestly, you'll find that you have interests and skills which you never knew you had or which you put on the back burner through your working life. At least, that's how it worked for me. I found that I could paint, for instance. That's a skill I never knew I had and enjoyed putting brush to canvas. Eventually, I found my way into disaster relief with the Southern Baptist's and that's given me a whole new identity, a whole new focus and it's been the best thing which ever happened to me. Yes, I'm still physically able to do that, but there are many, many who do it alongside me who are disabled. Even some in wheelchairs or really advanced age. They can be found doing administrative work or even something as simple as handing out bottles of water at a feeding unit. The point is that no matter the disability or the restricitions we find ourselves working with in old age, we can still find some useful work to do IF we're looking and IF we don't just sit down and amuse ourselves until we die.",
