Armenians and most historians regard the deaths as state-sponsored mass killings, or genocide, while Turkey insists the death were the result of a civil war coupled with disease and famine. During his presidential campaign, Obama pledged to recognize the deaths as genocide. He spoke in a January 2008 statement of his \u201cfirmly held conviction that the Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence.\u201d The Washington, D.C.-based Armenian National Committee of America endorsed Obama, delivering large blocs of votes in swing states and tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations, according to Politico.com. But at a Monday press conference with Turkish President Abdullah Gul and in a later address to the Turkish Parliament, Obama declined to recognize the Armenian deaths as genocide. Obama \u201cmissed a valuable opportunity to honor his public pledge to recognize the Armenian genocide,\u201d Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee, said in a statement. In his address to parliament, Obama did refer to the \u201cterrible events of 1915\u201d and said \u201cthe best way forward for the Turkish and Armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest, open and constructive.\u201d When asked by a reporter if he had encouraged President Gul \u201cto recognize the genocide by name,\u201d Obama did not answer directly and instead praised Gul for taking part in \u201ca series of negotiations \u2026 between Armenia and Turkey to resolve a whole host of longstanding issues, including this one.\u201d Rest here: \"http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/obama_armenians/2009/04/07/200573.html\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

Oh yes - he ducked it as much as he could. But - he's already on record for calling the events of 1915 genocide, and everyone knows that. So, what was the point of putting him on the spot in Turkey like that? It would have likely caused an international incident, and who other than opponents of Obama or the US would have benefitted from that? What's funny is that a reporter from the Chicago Tribune asked him the question!
