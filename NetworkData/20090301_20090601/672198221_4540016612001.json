Those that we attacked were directly linked to 9/11. Now, that being said, it is true that very little if anything has been accomplished in Afghanistan since the invasion. In fact, its got worse. That is a result of decision making in Washington, and not false justification.",

To begin with, why do we need to find jobs for active duty soldiers? Are we going to suddenly quit paying them for active duty? The only employment issue is with reserve component service members. In their case its an ongoing problem based on the economy. As many as 30% will return without a job, that is a problem. The hope among those of us that actually do something about it is that the stimulus package will create jobs in the construction trades through private construction contractors. That is what it is designed to do. Some of us don\u2019t just complain about situations we actually know little about. Helmets to Hardhats, the various State Employment Departments Veterans\u2019 Services, the US Department of Labor (VETS), and with the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Programs within the Reserve Component system are entering MOUs and other agreements with both private companies and organized labor to provide Veterans with the opportunities they will need as they return to country. Do we have a 100% firing solution\u2026of course not. But in local communities throughout the country we are working to address the issues. If you want to speak from a position of knowledge, get involved. Otherwise it\u2019s sour grapes.",
