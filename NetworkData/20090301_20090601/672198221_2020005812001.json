Please scroll down for the latest update. It seems a previous article I posted about the JDS Hyuga being commissioned last year, IIRC, was wrong; it was only just recently handed over to the JMSDF for service. This design would be great for convoy escort or as a floating base for special ops and might be able to support Harrier or follow on VTOL aircraft. Take note that, aside from the Hyuga, Japan has also 3 full flight-deck helicopter-capable amphibious assault ships of the Osumi class which could possibly also launch VTOL aircraft. 13,950-ton JDS Hyuga (16DDH) is handed over to Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force from its builder IHI Marine United Inc. in Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo, Wednesday, March 18, 2009. The newly-built helicopter-carrying destroyer, similar in design to a small aircraft carrier, is the the largest Japanese warship since World War II, deploying three helicopters on the flight deck while carrying up to 11 others on the hangar deck inside, Kyodo News said.
