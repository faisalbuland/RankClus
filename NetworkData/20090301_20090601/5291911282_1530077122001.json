Hi Cindy, I made some calls last week about the Easy Manufacturing Company in Lincoln, Nebraska. Here are some people you could contact for more information. Nebraska Historical Society, collections department, Deb Arons, 402-471-4759 Lincoln Journal Star (they took the picture you sent me), 800-742-7315 Don Ammon, 402-488-0300, I think he is related to Charles Ammon who apparently owned the business in the 1930's and maybe the 1940's. Good luck. Carol",
