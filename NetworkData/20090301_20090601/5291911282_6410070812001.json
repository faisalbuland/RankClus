Thank goodness, there haven't been any of those in a lot of years - - There are regular tech schools for all of them, but as I hinted at the top, some of the things I've seen EOD teams doing in Iraq and Afghanistan in proximity to IEDs just doesn't make sense to me, especially with the sophistication that could be built into a device today... A young Air Force troop from Utah was killed within the last few years while trying to disarm a car bomb. What are they teaching theses poeple??? I just had to shake my head. It's a war zone!! I'd back off 1-200 Meters and shoot the thing to pieces with non-explosive rounds. Many times, that will tear an expedient bomb apart without detonating it - - Oh well - - Make sure ya have the max life insurance if you decide to pursue your dreams.

If the person is smart enough they have a roving IP and can change the style of writing to make it look like more than one gum-chewing pimple-faced, kid with way too much technology on his/her hands. Also there is the possibility that the interloper is a writer who has failed at previous attempts to entice members to relate stories for their benefits in some novel, or script they are writing. Come back as a kid wanting to know just what they might expect in the near future. Averages and the bell curve and knowing what that is all about can tell you that some types of posts/events occur with a genuine frequency. Yet there are times that the frequency of some types of events/posts changes radically and then it leaves me to wonder why that change occurred. I see people giving information freely depending on how they perceive the visitor and there are some factors that almost guarantee an \"In\" with the targeted audience. So a person can come in here and learn what things work and don't work for the members here and then use that to gain whatever information they want. I always want to know more about an individual before I relate anything to them, Sometimes I have found myself disarmed to the point of just about telling them something I shouldn't. I think that's probably why one shouldn't drink to excess when surfing the web or even get loaded up on sleeping pills and post a notion on MDC.
