Now, Mr. Steele, if it is your position as the chairman of the Republican National Committee that you want a left wing Democrat president and a left wing Democrat Congress to succeed in advancing their agenda, if it\u2019s your position that you want President Obama and Speaker Pelosi and Senate leader Harry Reid to succeed with their massive spending and taxing and nationalization plans, I think you have some explaining to do. Why are you running the Republican Party? Why do you claim you lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it that President Obama succeeds? I frankly am stunned that the chairman of the Republican National Committee endorses such an agenda\u2026 Ouch! And thats not the worst of it cause you know his listeners are just gonna pile on...Steeel best get on that phone and called Daddy RIGHT NOW and apologize. This is Rush's party now! Your just..just....the lawn jockey in front of the GOP's house that Rush owns. (By the way if he was white I say the same thing. My point is whoever is head of the RNC is just a figure head.

Now, Mr. Steele, if it is your position as the chairman of the Republican National Committee that you want a left wing Democrat president and a left wing Democrat Congress to succeed in advancing their agenda, if it\u2019s your position that you want President Obama and Speaker Pelosi and Senate leader Harry Reid to succeed with their massive spending and taxing and nationalization plans, I think you have some explaining to do. Why are you running the Republican Party? Why do you claim you lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it that President Obama succeeds? I frankly am stunned that the chairman of the Republican National Committee endorses such an agenda\u2026 Ouch!

        "quote": "Originally posted by mcgreer: From Politico: On the same night he was offering the keynote address to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Rush Limbaugh drew criticism from an unlikely source: Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele. In a little-noticed interview Saturday night, Steele dismissed Limbaugh as an \u201centertainer\u201d whose show is \u201cincendiary\u201d and \u201cugly.\u201d Steele\u2019s criticism makes him the highest-ranking Republican to pick a fight with the popular and polarizing conservative talk show host. But the new RNC chairman\u2019s extraordinary comments won\u2019t sit well with the millions of conservative listeners Limbaugh draws each week, and Steele aides scrambled to limit the damage Monday morning by trying to change the subject... Limbaugh, asked to respond, said he\u2019d save his counter-attack for his listeners. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it on the radio,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. In an interview on CNN with D.L. Hughley, Steele assured that he, not Limbaugh, was in charge of the party before saying that he wanted to put the right-wing talker \u201cinto context.\u201d \u201cRush Limbaugh is an entertainer,\u201d Steele said. \u201cRush Limbaugh, his whole thing is entertainment. Yes it\u2019s incendiary, yes it\u2019s ugly...\u201d \"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19498.html\"",
        "reply": " Checked Free Republic and they are already ticked off at Steele take a look at tis choice quote: \"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/bloggers/2196657/posts?q=1&;page=1\" quote: Steele really disappointed me in his comments. I wonder if he is revealing his deep hidden allegiance to obuma\u2019s skin in the game loyalty of race????? Rush\u2019s comments were clear, consise and to the point. Rush said what the Repubs are too, scared to say \"the truth.\" In summation, steele is just \"another got skin in da game rino brother.\" I suspect by the end of the week Steele will be genuflecting at the alter of Rushbo with a huge mea culpa. Update: Steele may be in HUGE trouble cause Rush when asked about Steele's attack said this: \"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19498.html\" quote: I\u2019ll handle it on the radio Daddy just pulled out the belt and he's heading to the wood shed!

Also fact Check.org checked it and the Hawaii paper posted his birth annoucement back in 63 when he was born. So i'm not quite sure what your insinuating that since Rush never posted his Birth cert he may not actually be an American born citizen. Possible but only the most dense idiot would doubt Limbaugh like the President are native born americans. I mean only a compelete and utter fool would doubt Limbaugh and Obama are not US born citizens.",

At least Limbaugh doesn't cower from presenting his full and complete birth-related documentation, and he pays all of his taxes.
