I got to tell you, after 13 years of dealing with domestic violence in the military, it's the heterosexuals who cause the bulk of the \"destructive\" behavior and 'unit cohesion' problems. Just look at the problems arising from the incident at Ft. Lewis and those two 16 year girls found in the barracks, one dead. That's going to have far more lasting ramifications for that base in particular than anything a gay person in uniform will have! Or are the \"sins and trespasses\" of the heterosexual antics less \"sinful\" and filthy? NOPE. You're absolutely correct about immoral behaviors of heteros and of course most of it occurs in the hetero community. Afterall, they make up more than 95% of the population. BUT, having said THAT....is absolutely NO reason to be any more permissive with the \"sinful\" and filthy antics of gays....is it?",

(I EMBOLDENED this phrase) So, you revel more of your fundamentalist bias. Who is to say it is sinful and filthy antics? You? The US courts have not made any such claim, matter of fact quite the opposite. It's none of the \"laws\" business what consenting adults do in the privacy of their own homes, etc (you know, equal right to privacy.) There is no civil sound common sense law that says gay love is sinful, filthy or even a perversion. It's a human activity or behavior between people who just happen to be attracted to each other. Even the military doesn't say so directly (except to vilify sodomy, which I am sure is practiced more by heterosexuals in the military than anyone else.) I take it you give this prevision label based on your antique mythical God and his henchman Moses? Not to mention the pretender Paul the Apostate? Or, are you just normally this judgmental? Maybe, numbers, those fitly acts by heterosexual should also be a just reason to throw them out? Occasionally it happens, but rarely, unless violence was involved. At least the heterosexual get to give service in the military a try without being stigmatized before they do. Why not let the homosexuals who want to join the US military do so without any extra screening than there is now and if they misbehave in sinful filthy ways like heterosexuals do in large number, then deal with them with the existing regulations and laws. Nothing more needs to be done.... except drop without amending, the silly deceitfully concocted DA/DT law and it's other legal perversion the Sodom law of the UCMJ. btw... how do you know it's filthy? Have you seen it? I know you can get 'filthy' in a good heterosexual romp.",
