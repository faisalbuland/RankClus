Heimbach, an assistant director of the FBI's counterrorism division. \"He is a known animal rights extremist,\" Heimbach told reporters Tuesday at a Washington, D.C., news conference. He added that San Diego set an improvised explosive device in the bombings that caused \"extensive property damage and economic hardship.\" \"The investigation revealed that metal nails were used in the construction of the device to create a more forceful effect,\" Heimbach said.
