He is the poster child for term limits. First a LOt of the people int he Repub party that voted for Mr. Specter have left the party, his support int he general election has always been based on Moderate Repubs, independents and Moderate Demos and if he ran against Mr. Toomey in the general election I would give odds on him winning, which may be why many Pa Repubs are pushing Mr. Ridge as an alternative. Second the law in Pa is setup so that he had to change parties before the primaries to be allowed to run except on the Repub party ticket. The voting laws in Pa are setup to favor the two major parties by making it very hard and expensive to get on ballots if not a Repub or Demo and by mak it hard to switch parties near an election.
