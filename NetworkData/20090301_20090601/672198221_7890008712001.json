Dave It was fairly complex ... \"Sara Palin stimulus bill\" ... I did admit that I was \"dumb.\" I tried your criterium, with the quotes and again came up empty, it then occured to me that you meant Without the quotes, and yup - that works... quote: At the Republican convention in Minneapolis last summer, Palin introduced herself to America by declaring she was a foe of wasteful spending who had \"championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.\" She claimed that she had said \"thanks, but no thanks\" to America's most infamous earmark, the Bridge to Nowhere. During the presidential campaign, McCain railed incessantly against earmarks, at one point thundering that if he made it to White House, \"I will take an ink pen and I will veto every pork barrel earmark spending bill that comes across my desk.\" In trying to beat back the omnibus spending bill, McCain denounced earmarking as a \"corrupt practice.\" And he employed the timeworn tactic of publicly mocking silly sounding appropriations: \"How does anyone justify some of these earmarks: $1.7 million for pig odor research in Iowa; $2 million 'for the promotion of astronomy' in Hawaii; $6.6 million for termite research in New Orleans; $2.1 million for the Center for Grape Genetics in New York.\" But, as they often say in Washington, one legislator's pork is another legislator's necessary program. The earmarks that Palin apparently will accept could also be ridiculed in a McCain-ish fashion. They include $475,000 to construct a \"heritage center\" in the Chilkat Indian Village; $150,000 to support private industry participation in two international fishery groups; $200,000 for investigating and prosecuting bootlegging; $200,000 for researching the king crab; and $855,000 for building fairgrounds. The Alaska earmarks also include $1.2 million for construction work on an airport on Akutan, a tiny island that relies on seaplane for contact with the Alaskan mainland. (The Coast Guard handles medical emergencies.) The island has roughly 800 residents. Could this be dubbed the Airport to Nowhere? Whether or not any of these projects is worthwhile--the people of Akutan might need an airport to keep their community alive--Palin is certainly not decrying earmarks when they are benefiting her state.
