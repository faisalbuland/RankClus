Once American citizens being killed, Khobar Towers and the USS Cole suddenly Osama Ben Laden became a household word and the CIA had a new and bigger mission. We've been playing catch up ever since and Homeland secuirty is not producing the results it should. Thank the good Lord there were some grey beards in that crowd at Langley. Asst Director of the CIA was not ecstatic. After being handed your head by a politician simply to disperse critical observations of the weakness of the new leadership comes close to a prosecutional offense more than attaining information savings the lives of Americans. I wish I could have been at the formal meeting that preceded the cheerleading ceremonies. What does any of this have to do with CIA\u2019s euphoric welcome of POTUS?",

I wish I could have been at the formal meeting that preceded the cheerleading ceremonies. What does any of this have to do with CIA\u2019s euphoric welcome of POTUS?",
