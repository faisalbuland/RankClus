WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WW II MOVIE STARS? Some of you younger guys probably have not even heard of these 'old movie stars'... some contrast between these men and the anti-American movie stars of today. In contrast to the ideals, opinions and feelings of today's \"Hollywonk, \" the real actors of yester-year loved the United States . They had both class and integrity. With the advent of World War II many of our actors went to fight rather than stand and rant against this country we all love. They gave up their wealth, position and fame to become service men & women, many as simple \"enlisted men\". This page lists but a few, but from this group of only 18 men came over 70 medals in honor of their valor,spanning from Bronze Stars, Silver Stars, Distinguish Service Cross', Purple Hearts and one Congressional Medal of Honor. So remember; while the \"Entertainers of 2005-2006\" have been in all of the news media lately I would like to remind the people of what the entertainers of 1943 were doing, (65 years ago). Most of these brave men have since passed on. \"Real Hollywood Heroes\" Alec Guinnes (Star Wars) operated a British Royal Navy landing craft on D-Day. James Doohan (\"Scotty\" on Star Trek) landed in Normandy with the U. S. Army on D-Day. Donald Pleasance (The Great Escape) really was an R.. A. F. pilot who was shot down, held prisoner and tortured by the Germans. David Niven was a Sandhurst graduate and Lt. Colonel of the British Commandos in Normandy . James Stewart entered the Army Air Force as a private and worked his way to the rank of Colonel.During World War II, Stewart served as a bomber pilot,his service record crediting him with leading more than 20 missions over Germany ,and taking part in hundreds of air strikes during his tour of duty. Stewart earned the Air Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross,France 'S Croix de Guerre, and 7 Battle Stars during World War II. In peace time, Stewart continued to be an active member of the Air Force as a reservist, reaching the rank of Brigadier General before retiring in the late 1950s. Clark Gable (Mega-Movie Star when war broke out) Although he was beyond the draft age at the time the U.S. entered WW II, Clark Gable enlisted as a private in the AAF on Aug. 12, 1942 at Los Angeles. He attended the Officers' Candidate School at Miami Beach , Fla. and graduated as a second lieutenant on Oct. 28, 1942.He then attended aerial gunnery school and in Feb. 1943 ,he was assigned to the 351st Bomb Group at Polebrook where flew operational missions over Europe in B-17s. Capt. Gable returned to the U.S. in Oct. 1943 and was relieved from active duty as a major on Jun. 12, 1944 at his own request, since he was over-age for combat. Charlton Heston was an Army Air Corps Sergeant in Kodiak. Ernest Borgnine was a U. S. Navy Gunners Mate 1935-1945.(Maybe that's why he starred in \"McHale's Navy\") Charles Durning was a U. S. Army Ranger at Normandy earning a Silver Star and awarded the Purple Heart. Charles Bronson was a tail gunner in the Army Air Corps, more specifically on B-29's in the 20th Air Force out of Guam, Tinian, and Saipan George C. Scott was a decorated U. S. Marine. Eddie Albert (Green Acres TV) was awarded a Bronze Star for his heroic action as a U. S.Naval officer aiding Marines at the horrific battle on the island of Tarawa in the Pacific Nov. 1943. Brian Keith served as a US . Marine rear gunner in several actions against the Japanese on Rabal in the Pacific. Lee Marvin was a U.S. Marine on Saipan during the Marianas campaign when he was wounded earning the Purple Heart. John Russell: In 1942, he enlisted in the Marine Corps where he received a battlefield commission and was wounded and highly decorated for valor at Guadalcanal. Robert Ryan was a U.. S. Marine who served with the O. S. S. in Yugoslavia . Tyrone Power (an established movie star when Pearl Harbor was bombed) joined the U.S. Marines, was a pilot flying supplies into, and wounded Marines out of, Iwo Jima and Okinawa . Audie Murphy, little 5'5\" tall 110 pound guy from Texas who played cowboy parts: Most Decorated serviceman of WWII and earned: Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, 2 Silver Star Medals, Legion of Merit, 2 Bronze Star Medals with \"V\", 2 Purple Hearts, U.S. Army Outstanding Civilian Service Medal, Good Conduct Medal, 2 Distinguished Unit Emblems, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with One Silver Star, Four Bronze Service Stars (representing nine campaigns) and one Bronze Arrowhead (representing assault landing at Sicily and Southern France) World War II Victory Medal Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Marksman Badge with Rifle Bar, Expert Badge with Bayonet Bar, French Fourragere in Colors of the Croix de Guerre, French Legion of Honor, Grade of Chevalier, French Croix de Guerre W ith Silver Star, French Croix de Guerre with Palm, Medal of Liberated France, Belgian Croix de Guerre 1940 Palm. So how do you feel the real heroes of the silver screen acted when compared to the hollywonks today who spew out anti-American drivel as they bite the hand that feeds them? Can you imagine these stars of yester-year saying they hate our flag, making anti-war speeches, marching in anti-American parades and saying they hate our president? I thought not, neither did I! ********************************************** It is the soldier, not the President, who gives us democracy. It is the soldier, not the Congress, who takes care of us.

        "content": "...and Robert Montgomery was already an Oscar winning actor before the war; having started in motion pictures in 1929. After World War II broke out in Europe, Montgomery enlisted in London for American field service and drove ambulances in France until the Dunkirk evacuation. Upon America' entrance into the war, Montgomery joined the U.S. Navy and served as Naval Attache on British destroyers hunting U-boats. He attended torpedo boat school, became a PT boat commander, and participated in the D-Day invasion on board a Destroyer. Montgomery served five years of active war duty, was awarded a Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Ribbon, the European Theater Ribbon with two Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar, and promoted to the rank of Lt. Commander. (1904-1981) You have to look through a lot of oldies to find his work, \"YellowJack\" was one he portrayed Major Walter Reed trying to eradicate Yellow Fever in Cuba. By far his best production was his Daughter Elisabeth Montgomery who charmed audiences with her series \"Bewitched\". Ronald Reagan joined the Army Reserve as a Private in 1937 as rumors of a second war in Europe began anew. Following intensive training he was Commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the Cavalry. In 1942, he was called to active duty with the US Army Air Corps and assigned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit (which made over 400 training films). In 1943 he was promoted to Captain; and it was in this grade that he was honorably discharged in 1945. Following the end of WW II he was elected President of the Screen Actors' Guild in 1947. He went on to become the 40th President of the United States on January 20th, 1981 serving two consecutive terms. (1911 - 2004) died at the age of 93, after years of suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Who can add to his accomplishments. Bob Hope \"America's No. 1 Soldier in Greasepaint.\" to the GIs, he was \"G.I. Bob\" and their clown hero. It began in May, 1941 when Bob, with a group of performers, went to March Field, California, it continued on with his first trip into the combat area in 1943 when he and his small USO Troupe - Frances Langford, Tony Romano and Jack Pepper visited US military facilities in England, Africa, Sicily and Ireland. His love of America and her G.I.s has continued on into this era, in May 1997, in New Orleans - Bob stood by as Dolores christened the USNS Bob Hope (AKR 300), the first of a new class of ships named after Bob. Not to be outdone, one month later the U.S. Air Force dedicated a new C-17 in his name. (In 2001, the C-17 the 'Spirit of Bob Hope,' transported the pilots and crew of the reconnaissance plane downed in China back safe and sound to Hawaii.) Five times Bob has been honored by the United States Congress. But, in October 1997, Bob received one of his greatest tributes when Resolution 75 was unanimously passed by members of both Houses making him an Honorary Veteran. In July 2001, the 'Pentagon' paid a visit to Bob Hope's home in Toluca Lake, California for the presentation of the Order of Horatio Gates Gold Medal for his life-long contributions toward maintaining the high morale of soldiers around the world. (1903-2003) died of pneumonia Wayne Morris born Bert DeWayne Morris, Jr. on February 17, 1914. Morris became one of the first Hollywood actors to enter the service, joining the Naval Reserves and receiving a Commission. Following flight training and a year as an instructor, he was thrust immediately in the Pacific air war, flying an F6F Hellcat with VF-15 off the carrier, the USS Essex. He would go on to fly 57 missions, shooting down seven Japanese aircraft, as well as participating in the sinking of five Japanese warships; making him one of the early American aces of the war. Of the 57 missions he flew, three of his Hellcats were so full of holes when he returned to his carrier, they were rendered \"unfit for duty\" and dumped overboard. He was awarded four Distinguished Flying Crosses and two Air Medals for an acts of Valor and Courage, American Campaign Medal; National Defense Medal; Philippines Liberation Medal (w/ battle star); China Service Medal; Asiatic Pacific Theater Medal (w/battle star and Overseas Service Bar, earned while flying in active operations against the enemy. He earned the rank of Lt. Commander. Too many movies to list. He did \"Kid Gallahad\" before Elvis did it years later. James Arness served in the U.S. Army and was wounded at Anzio. He received both the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star Medal for Valor, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Ribbon, the European Theater Ribbon with four Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar. (1923-present) Marshall Dillon, Bronze Star, cool beans... Ed McMahan earned his wings as a Marine Fighter Pilot in 1944 and became an instructor teaching carrier landings and a test pilot. After World War II, he remained in the Marine Reserves and his television career was interrupted in 1952 when he was called back into the Marine Corps. He flew 85 combat missions in Korea. Later he retired from the Marines as a full Colonel. Didn't know that. 85 Combat Missions! Harold Russell joined the U.S. Army on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor; as an Instructor in the Parachute Corps. Sgt. Russell was working as an explosives expert in 1944 when a defective fuse exploded a charge of TNT he was holding as he instructed a demolition squad at Camp Mackall, N.C. Both hands were amputated. For his performance in \"Best Years of our Lives\" (1946), Russell won both the Academy Award as the year's Best Supporting Actor and a second, honorary Oscar \"For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans.\" He is the only actor ever to win two Oscars for the same role. He became an avid advocate for the disabled for the rest of his life and served three terms as the Commander of AMVETS. (1914-2002) See the movie \"Diary of a Sergeant\". Orvon \"Gene\" Autry During World War II, Autry enlisted for service on the air during a broadcast of his show, going on to serve his country as a Flight Officer with the Air Transport Command. From 1943 until 1945, he flew C-47 cargo planes in the China-Burma-India theater, earning the American Campaign Medal; National Defense Medal; China Service Medal; Asiatic Pacific Theater Medal (w/battle star and Overseas Service Bar. When the war ended, Autry was assigned to Special Services, where he toured with a USO Troupe in the South Pacific before resuming his movie career in 1946. (See my page: \"Flying the Hump\") (1907-1998) He had no children. Gene Autry died of lymphoma at age 91 No more need be said about this guy. Anyone who grew up in my era knew him first in the saddle then in the jeep.

When the Korean Conflict erupted, Williams re-enlisted at age 34, and spent the next two years on combat duty. One of his close friends in the unit to which he had been assigned was future astronaut and senator, John Glenn. Williams flew a total of 38 combat missions and, on February 16, 1953, he had to crash land his K-13 fighter after a mission. He survived, was was awarded the Air Medal by President Harry Truman, and eventually, returned to baseball at the end of the 1953 season.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WW II MOVIE STARS? Some of you younger guys probably have not even heard of these 'old movie stars'... some contrast between these men and the anti-American movie stars of today. In contrast to the ideals, opinions and feelings of today's \"Hollywonk, \" the real actors of yester-year loved the United States . They had both class and integrity. With the advent of World War II many of our actors went to fight rather than stand and rant against this country we all love. They gave up their wealth, position and fame to become service men & women, many as simple \"enlisted men\". This page lists but a few, but from this group of only 18 men came over 70 medals in honor of their valor,spanning from Bronze Stars, Silver Stars, Distinguish Service Cross', Purple Hearts and one Congressional Medal of Honor. So remember; while the \"Entertainers of 2005-2006\" have been in all of the news media lately I would like to remind the people of what the entertainers of 1943 were doing, (65 years ago). Most of these brave men have since passed on. \"Real Hollywood Heroes\" Alec Guinnes (Star Wars) operated a British Royal Navy landing craft on D-Day. James Doohan (\"Scotty\" on Star Trek) landed in Normandy with the U. S. Army on D-Day. Donald Pleasance (The Great Escape) really was an R.. A. F. pilot who was shot down, held prisoner and tortured by the Germans. David Niven was a Sandhurst graduate and Lt. Colonel of the British Commandos in Normandy . James Stewart entered the Army Air Force as a private and worked his way to the rank of Colonel.During World War II, Stewart served as a bomber pilot,his service record crediting him with leading more than 20 missions over Germany ,and taking part in hundreds of air strikes during his tour of duty. Stewart earned the Air Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross,France 'S Croix de Guerre, and 7 Battle Stars during World War II. In peace time, Stewart continued to be an active member of the Air Force as a reservist, reaching the rank of Brigadier General before retiring in the late 1950s. Clark Gable (Mega-Movie Star when war broke out) Although he was beyond the draft age at the time the U.S. entered WW II, Clark Gable enlisted as a private in the AAF on Aug. 12, 1942 at Los Angeles. He attended the Officers' Candidate School at Miami Beach , Fla. and graduated as a second lieutenant on Oct. 28, 1942.He then attended aerial gunnery school and in Feb. 1943 ,he was assigned to the 351st Bomb Group at Polebrook where flew operational missions over Europe in B-17s. Capt. Gable returned to the U.S. in Oct. 1943 and was relieved from active duty as a major on Jun. 12, 1944 at his own request, since he was over-age for combat. Charlton Heston was an Army Air Corps Sergeant in Kodiak. Ernest Borgnine was a U. S. Navy Gunners Mate 1935-1945.(Maybe that's why he starred in \"McHale's Navy\") Charles Durning was a U. S. Army Ranger at Normandy earning a Silver Star and awarded the Purple Heart. Charles Bronson was a tail gunner in the Army Air Corps, more specifically on B-29's in the 20th Air Force out of Guam, Tinian, and Saipan George C. Scott was a decorated U. S. Marine. Eddie Albert (Green Acres TV) was awarded a Bronze Star for his heroic action as a U. S.Naval officer aiding Marines at the horrific battle on the island of Tarawa in the Pacific Nov. 1943. Brian Keith served as a US . Marine rear gunner in several actions against the Japanese on Rabal in the Pacific. Lee Marvin was a U.S. Marine on Saipan during the Marianas campaign when he was wounded earning the Purple Heart. John Russell: In 1942, he enlisted in the Marine Corps where he received a battlefield commission and was wounded and highly decorated for valor at Guadalcanal. Robert Ryan was a U.. S. Marine who served with the O. S. S. in Yugoslavia . Tyrone Power (an established movie star when Pearl Harbor was bombed) joined the U.S. Marines, was a pilot flying supplies into, and wounded Marines out of, Iwo Jima and Okinawa . Audie Murphy, little 5'5\" tall 110 pound guy from Texas who played cowboy parts: Most Decorated serviceman of WWII and earned: Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, 2 Silver Star Medals, Legion of Merit, 2 Bronze Star Medals with \"V\", 2 Purple Hearts, U.S. Army Outstanding Civilian Service Medal, Good Conduct Medal, 2 Distinguished Unit Emblems, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with One Silver Star, Four Bronze Service Stars (representing nine campaigns) and one Bronze Arrowhead (representing assault landing at Sicily and Southern France) World War II Victory Medal Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Marksman Badge with Rifle Bar, Expert Badge with Bayonet Bar, French Fourragere in Colors of the Croix de Guerre, French Legion of Honor, Grade of Chevalier, French Croix de Guerre W ith Silver Star, French Croix de Guerre with Palm, Medal of Liberated France, Belgian Croix de Guerre 1940 Palm. So how do you feel the real heroes of the silver screen acted when compared to the hollywonks today who spew out anti-American drivel as they bite the hand that feeds them? Can you imagine these stars of yester-year saying they hate our flag, making anti-war speeches, marching in anti-American parades and saying they hate our president?

        "content": "...and Robert Montgomery was already an Oscar winning actor before the war; having started in motion pictures in 1929. After World War II broke out in Europe, Montgomery enlisted in London for American field service and drove ambulances in France until the Dunkirk evacuation. Upon America' entrance into the war, Montgomery joined the U.S. Navy and served as Naval Attache on British destroyers hunting U-boats. He attended torpedo boat school, became a PT boat commander, and participated in the D-Day invasion on board a Destroyer. Montgomery served five years of active war duty, was awarded a Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Ribbon, the European Theater Ribbon with two Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar, and promoted to the rank of Lt. Commander. (1904-1981) You have to look through a lot of oldies to find his work, \"YellowJack\" was one he portrayed Major Walter Reed trying to eradicate Yellow Fever in Cuba. By far his best production was his Daughter Elisabeth Montgomery who charmed audiences with her series \"Bewitched\". Ronald Reagan joined the Army Reserve as a Private in 1937 as rumors of a second war in Europe began anew. Following intensive training he was Commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the Cavalry. In 1942, he was called to active duty with the US Army Air Corps and assigned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit (which made over 400 training films). In 1943 he was promoted to Captain; and it was in this grade that he was honorably discharged in 1945. Following the end of WW II he was elected President of the Screen Actors' Guild in 1947. He went on to become the 40th President of the United States on January 20th, 1981 serving two consecutive terms. (1911 - 2004) died at the age of 93, after years of suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Who can add to his accomplishments. Bob Hope \"America's No. 1 Soldier in Greasepaint.\" to the GIs, he was \"G.I. Bob\" and their clown hero. It began in May, 1941 when Bob, with a group of performers, went to March Field, California, it continued on with his first trip into the combat area in 1943 when he and his small USO Troupe - Frances Langford, Tony Romano and Jack Pepper visited US military facilities in England, Africa, Sicily and Ireland. His love of America and her G.I.s has continued on into this era, in May 1997, in New Orleans - Bob stood by as Dolores christened the USNS Bob Hope (AKR 300), the first of a new class of ships named after Bob. Not to be outdone, one month later the U.S. Air Force dedicated a new C-17 in his name. (In 2001, the C-17 the 'Spirit of Bob Hope,' transported the pilots and crew of the reconnaissance plane downed in China back safe and sound to Hawaii.) Five times Bob has been honored by the United States Congress. But, in October 1997, Bob received one of his greatest tributes when Resolution 75 was unanimously passed by members of both Houses making him an Honorary Veteran. In July 2001, the 'Pentagon' paid a visit to Bob Hope's home in Toluca Lake, California for the presentation of the Order of Horatio Gates Gold Medal for his life-long contributions toward maintaining the high morale of soldiers around the world. (1903-2003) died of pneumonia Wayne Morris born Bert DeWayne Morris, Jr. on February 17, 1914. Morris became one of the first Hollywood actors to enter the service, joining the Naval Reserves and receiving a Commission. Following flight training and a year as an instructor, he was thrust immediately in the Pacific air war, flying an F6F Hellcat with VF-15 off the carrier, the USS Essex. He would go on to fly 57 missions, shooting down seven Japanese aircraft, as well as participating in the sinking of five Japanese warships; making him one of the early American aces of the war. Of the 57 missions he flew, three of his Hellcats were so full of holes when he returned to his carrier, they were rendered \"unfit for duty\" and dumped overboard. He was awarded four Distinguished Flying Crosses and two Air Medals for an acts of Valor and Courage, American Campaign Medal; National Defense Medal; Philippines Liberation Medal (w/ battle star); China Service Medal; Asiatic Pacific Theater Medal (w/battle star and Overseas Service Bar, earned while flying in active operations against the enemy. He earned the rank of Lt. Commander. Too many movies to list. He did \"Kid Gallahad\" before Elvis did it years later. James Arness served in the U.S. Army and was wounded at Anzio. He received both the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star Medal for Valor, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Ribbon, the European Theater Ribbon with four Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar. (1923-present) Marshall Dillon, Bronze Star, cool beans... Ed McMahan earned his wings as a Marine Fighter Pilot in 1944 and became an instructor teaching carrier landings and a test pilot. After World War II, he remained in the Marine Reserves and his television career was interrupted in 1952 when he was called back into the Marine Corps. He flew 85 combat missions in Korea. Later he retired from the Marines as a full Colonel. Didn't know that. 85 Combat Missions! Harold Russell joined the U.S. Army on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor; as an Instructor in the Parachute Corps. Sgt. Russell was working as an explosives expert in 1944 when a defective fuse exploded a charge of TNT he was holding as he instructed a demolition squad at Camp Mackall, N.C. Both hands were amputated. For his performance in \"Best Years of our Lives\" (1946), Russell won both the Academy Award as the year's Best Supporting Actor and a second, honorary Oscar \"For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans.\" He is the only actor ever to win two Oscars for the same role. He became an avid advocate for the disabled for the rest of his life and served three terms as the Commander of AMVETS. (1914-2002) See the movie \"Diary of a Sergeant\". Orvon \"Gene\" Autry During World War II, Autry enlisted for service on the air during a broadcast of his show, going on to serve his country as a Flight Officer with the Air Transport Command. From 1943 until 1945, he flew C-47 cargo planes in the China-Burma-India theater, earning the American Campaign Medal; National Defense Medal; China Service Medal; Asiatic Pacific Theater Medal (w/battle star and Overseas Service Bar. When the war ended, Autry was assigned to Special Services, where he toured with a USO Troupe in the South Pacific before resuming his movie career in 1946. (See my page: \"Flying the Hump\") (1907-1998) He had no children. Gene Autry died of lymphoma at age 91 No more need be said about this guy.

When the Korean Conflict erupted, Williams re-enlisted at age 34, and spent the next two years on combat duty. One of his close friends in the unit to which he had been assigned was future astronaut and senator, John Glenn.

He survived, was was awarded the Air Medal by President Harry Truman, and eventually, returned to baseball at the end of the 1953 season.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WW II MOVIE STARS? Some of you younger guys probably have not even heard of these 'old movie stars'... some contrast between these men and the anti-American movie stars of today. In contrast to the ideals, opinions and feelings of today's \"Hollywonk, \" the real actors of yester-year loved the United States . They had both class and integrity. With the advent of World War II many of our actors went to fight rather than stand and rant against this country we all love. They gave up their wealth, position and fame to become service men & women, many as simple \"enlisted men\". This page lists but a few, but from this group of only 18 men came over 70 medals in honor of their valor,spanning from Bronze Stars, Silver Stars, Distinguish Service Cross', Purple Hearts and one Congressional Medal of Honor. So remember; while the \"Entertainers of 2005-2006\" have been in all of the news media lately I would like to remind the people of what the entertainers of 1943 were doing, (65 years ago). Most of these brave men have since passed on. \"Real Hollywood Heroes\" Alec Guinnes (Star Wars) operated a British Royal Navy landing craft on D-Day. James Doohan (\"Scotty\" on Star Trek) landed in Normandy with the U. S. Army on D-Day. Donald Pleasance (The Great Escape) really was an R.. A. F. pilot who was shot down, held prisoner and tortured by the Germans. David Niven was a Sandhurst graduate and Lt. Colonel of the British Commandos in Normandy . James Stewart entered the Army Air Force as a private and worked his way to the rank of Colonel.During World War II, Stewart served as a bomber pilot,his service record crediting him with leading more than 20 missions over Germany ,and taking part in hundreds of air strikes during his tour of duty. Stewart earned the Air Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross,France 'S Croix de Guerre, and 7 Battle Stars during World War II. In peace time, Stewart continued to be an active member of the Air Force as a reservist, reaching the rank of Brigadier General before retiring in the late 1950s. Clark Gable (Mega-Movie Star when war broke out) Although he was beyond the draft age at the time the U.S. entered WW II, Clark Gable enlisted as a private in the AAF on Aug. 12, 1942 at Los Angeles. He attended the Officers' Candidate School at Miami Beach , Fla. and graduated as a second lieutenant on Oct. 28, 1942.He then attended aerial gunnery school and in Feb. 1943 ,he was assigned to the 351st Bomb Group at Polebrook where flew operational missions over Europe in B-17s. Capt. Gable returned to the U.S. in Oct. 1943 and was relieved from active duty as a major on Jun. 12, 1944 at his own request, since he was over-age for combat. Charlton Heston was an Army Air Corps Sergeant in Kodiak. Ernest Borgnine was a U. S. Navy Gunners Mate 1935-1945.(Maybe that's why he starred in \"McHale's Navy\") Charles Durning was a U. S. Army Ranger at Normandy earning a Silver Star and awarded the Purple Heart. Charles Bronson was a tail gunner in the Army Air Corps, more specifically on B-29's in the 20th Air Force out of Guam, Tinian, and Saipan George C. Scott was a decorated U. S. Marine. Eddie Albert (Green Acres TV) was awarded a Bronze Star for his heroic action as a U. S.Naval officer aiding Marines at the horrific battle on the island of Tarawa in the Pacific Nov. 1943. Brian Keith served as a US . Marine rear gunner in several actions against the Japanese on Rabal in the Pacific. Lee Marvin was a U.S. Marine on Saipan during the Marianas campaign when he was wounded earning the Purple Heart. John Russell: In 1942, he enlisted in the Marine Corps where he received a battlefield commission and was wounded and highly decorated for valor at Guadalcanal. Robert Ryan was a U.. S. Marine who served with the O. S. S. in Yugoslavia . Tyrone Power (an established movie star when Pearl Harbor was bombed) joined the U.S. Marines, was a pilot flying supplies into, and wounded Marines out of, Iwo Jima and Okinawa . Audie Murphy, little 5'5\" tall 110 pound guy from Texas who played cowboy parts: Most Decorated serviceman of WWII and earned: Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, 2 Silver Star Medals, Legion of Merit, 2 Bronze Star Medals with \"V\", 2 Purple Hearts, U.S. Army Outstanding Civilian Service Medal, Good Conduct Medal, 2 Distinguished Unit Emblems, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with One Silver Star, Four Bronze Service Stars (representing nine campaigns) and one Bronze Arrowhead (representing assault landing at Sicily and Southern France) World War II Victory Medal Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Marksman Badge with Rifle Bar, Expert Badge with Bayonet Bar, French Fourragere in Colors of the Croix de Guerre, French Legion of Honor, Grade of Chevalier, French Croix de Guerre W ith Silver Star, French Croix de Guerre with Palm, Medal of Liberated France, Belgian Croix de Guerre 1940 Palm. So how do you feel the real heroes of the silver screen acted when compared to the hollywonks today who spew out anti-American drivel as they bite the hand that feeds them? Can you imagine these stars of yester-year saying they hate our flag, making anti-war speeches, marching in anti-American parades and saying they hate our president?

        "content": "...and Robert Montgomery was already an Oscar winning actor before the war; having started in motion pictures in 1929. After World War II broke out in Europe, Montgomery enlisted in London for American field service and drove ambulances in France until the Dunkirk evacuation. Upon America' entrance into the war, Montgomery joined the U.S. Navy and served as Naval Attache on British destroyers hunting U-boats. He attended torpedo boat school, became a PT boat commander, and participated in the D-Day invasion on board a Destroyer. Montgomery served five years of active war duty, was awarded a Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Ribbon, the European Theater Ribbon with two Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar, and promoted to the rank of Lt. Commander. (1904-1981) You have to look through a lot of oldies to find his work, \"YellowJack\" was one he portrayed Major Walter Reed trying to eradicate Yellow Fever in Cuba. By far his best production was his Daughter Elisabeth Montgomery who charmed audiences with her series \"Bewitched\". Ronald Reagan joined the Army Reserve as a Private in 1937 as rumors of a second war in Europe began anew. Following intensive training he was Commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the Cavalry. In 1942, he was called to active duty with the US Army Air Corps and assigned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit (which made over 400 training films). In 1943 he was promoted to Captain; and it was in this grade that he was honorably discharged in 1945. Following the end of WW II he was elected President of the Screen Actors' Guild in 1947. He went on to become the 40th President of the United States on January 20th, 1981 serving two consecutive terms. (1911 - 2004) died at the age of 93, after years of suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Who can add to his accomplishments. Bob Hope \"America's No. 1 Soldier in Greasepaint.\" to the GIs, he was \"G.I. Bob\" and their clown hero. It began in May, 1941 when Bob, with a group of performers, went to March Field, California, it continued on with his first trip into the combat area in 1943 when he and his small USO Troupe - Frances Langford, Tony Romano and Jack Pepper visited US military facilities in England, Africa, Sicily and Ireland. His love of America and her G.I.s has continued on into this era, in May 1997, in New Orleans - Bob stood by as Dolores christened the USNS Bob Hope (AKR 300), the first of a new class of ships named after Bob. Not to be outdone, one month later the U.S. Air Force dedicated a new C-17 in his name. (In 2001, the C-17 the 'Spirit of Bob Hope,' transported the pilots and crew of the reconnaissance plane downed in China back safe and sound to Hawaii.) Five times Bob has been honored by the United States Congress. But, in October 1997, Bob received one of his greatest tributes when Resolution 75 was unanimously passed by members of both Houses making him an Honorary Veteran. In July 2001, the 'Pentagon' paid a visit to Bob Hope's home in Toluca Lake, California for the presentation of the Order of Horatio Gates Gold Medal for his life-long contributions toward maintaining the high morale of soldiers around the world. (1903-2003) died of pneumonia Wayne Morris born Bert DeWayne Morris, Jr. on February 17, 1914. Morris became one of the first Hollywood actors to enter the service, joining the Naval Reserves and receiving a Commission. Following flight training and a year as an instructor, he was thrust immediately in the Pacific air war, flying an F6F Hellcat with VF-15 off the carrier, the USS Essex. He would go on to fly 57 missions, shooting down seven Japanese aircraft, as well as participating in the sinking of five Japanese warships; making him one of the early American aces of the war. Of the 57 missions he flew, three of his Hellcats were so full of holes when he returned to his carrier, they were rendered \"unfit for duty\" and dumped overboard. He was awarded four Distinguished Flying Crosses and two Air Medals for an acts of Valor and Courage, American Campaign Medal; National Defense Medal; Philippines Liberation Medal (w/ battle star); China Service Medal; Asiatic Pacific Theater Medal (w/battle star and Overseas Service Bar, earned while flying in active operations against the enemy. He earned the rank of Lt. Commander. Too many movies to list. He did \"Kid Gallahad\" before Elvis did it years later. James Arness served in the U.S. Army and was wounded at Anzio. He received both the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star Medal for Valor, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Ribbon, the European Theater Ribbon with four Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar. (1923-present) Marshall Dillon, Bronze Star, cool beans... Ed McMahan earned his wings as a Marine Fighter Pilot in 1944 and became an instructor teaching carrier landings and a test pilot. After World War II, he remained in the Marine Reserves and his television career was interrupted in 1952 when he was called back into the Marine Corps. He flew 85 combat missions in Korea. Later he retired from the Marines as a full Colonel. Didn't know that. 85 Combat Missions! Harold Russell joined the U.S. Army on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor; as an Instructor in the Parachute Corps. Sgt. Russell was working as an explosives expert in 1944 when a defective fuse exploded a charge of TNT he was holding as he instructed a demolition squad at Camp Mackall, N.C. Both hands were amputated. For his performance in \"Best Years of our Lives\" (1946), Russell won both the Academy Award as the year's Best Supporting Actor and a second, honorary Oscar \"For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans.\" He is the only actor ever to win two Oscars for the same role. He became an avid advocate for the disabled for the rest of his life and served three terms as the Commander of AMVETS. (1914-2002) See the movie \"Diary of a Sergeant\". Orvon \"Gene\" Autry During World War II, Autry enlisted for service on the air during a broadcast of his show, going on to serve his country as a Flight Officer with the Air Transport Command. From 1943 until 1945, he flew C-47 cargo planes in the China-Burma-India theater, earning the American Campaign Medal; National Defense Medal; China Service Medal; Asiatic Pacific Theater Medal (w/battle star and Overseas Service Bar. When the war ended, Autry was assigned to Special Services, where he toured with a USO Troupe in the South Pacific before resuming his movie career in 1946. (See my page: \"Flying the Hump\") (1907-1998) He had no children. Gene Autry died of lymphoma at age 91 No more need be said about this guy.
