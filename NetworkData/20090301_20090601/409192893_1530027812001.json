Although Pentagon planners frequently complain about having to operate in a \u201cfiscally constrained\u201d environment, the U.S. accounts for nearly half of global military outlays. It is a remarkable reflection of America\u2019s economic strength that less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population can sustain such a high level of defense spending, using less than 5 percent of gross domestic product. How serious? Shortly before President Barack Obama took office, the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s top analyst completed a major assessment of global trends through 2025. The analyst, Thomas Fingar, predicted that the international system would be \u201ctransformed\u201d over the next 15 years in much the same way that it was remade after World War II. But unlike during the Cold War, when America rose to unrivaled supremacy, Fingar\u2019s study predicted it would be China that had the most influence on global politics and economics in the years ahead.

What you're also missing is that, while China owns our debt, China also depends on the world's largest consumer (us). As our consumption drops, their production drops. So, they need our economy to succeed. As their economy stalls, they will become more dependent on outside assistance of some sort. What they actually need is a suitable substitute to our sick economy - it's probably why they're pushing for a single world currency, as that would be one of the few instruments that could replace the US dollar. Again, you are correct in your point. Most do not understand that the US is a super power. not because of our Military alone, but because we are: 1. The Bread Basket of the world 2. The economy of the world. The US is responsible for over 25% of the entire worlds economy. If we tank, MANY OTHERS will as well.

The unusual proposal, made by central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan in an essay released Monday in Beijing, is part of China's increasingly assertive approach to shaping the global response to the financial crisis. Mr. Zhou's proposal comes amid preparations for a summit of the world's industrial and developing nations, the Group of 20, in London next week. At past such meetings, developed nations have criticized China's economic and currency policies.
