I was wondering if the Air Force would accept a GED to join or does it HAVE to be a High School Diploma. I was thinking about joining the Air Force directly after my 18th birthday, but i just need to know what i need to do. Any advice for someone just starting out would be greatly appreciated. you can contact me through my email: Contact member through profile e-mail I really appreciate it, -Roy This message has been edited.
