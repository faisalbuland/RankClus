What could have gone through this mans mind to perform such a hideous deed? Did he somehow believe that he was justified and this was a form of revenge? He must have known that he would be caught. I don't believe that he can claim PTSD in this case. The other four soldiers that assisted him and them selves were previously tried and convicted. Don't know what his sentence will be. Whatever it is will not be enough for his crime.",
