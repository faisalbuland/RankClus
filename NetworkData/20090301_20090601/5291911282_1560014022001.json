I spent less than two years at Holloman AFB (.MIL website) but I saw more things that just put me back in my seat, with jaw slack in total wonder. One of my absolute favorite places to be was at the \"Rocket Test Sled Track\" there at Holloman. To see a rocket take off sideways and blast down the railway at top speed to perform one test or another. Truely fascinating speed and power you feel deep into your bones. A rocket is an amazing thing to watch when ignited. What was your favorite place? Not just a Duty Station but a favorite place on a base, on a ship, or on overnight bivouac.
