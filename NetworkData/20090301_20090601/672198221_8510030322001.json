For now anyway. \"The 19-year-old Hubble, last visited by astronauts seven years ago, is way overdue for a tune-up. On this fifth and final repair mission, Atlantis' crew will replace Hubble's batteries and gyroscopes, install two new cameras and take a crack at fixing two broken science instruments, something never before attempted. Those instruments, loaded with bolts and fasteners, were not designed to be tinkered with in space. They also will remove the command and data-handling unit that failed in September and had to be revived, and put in a spare that was hustled into operation. Fresh insulating covers will be added to the outside of the telescope, and a new fine guidance sensor for pointing will be hooked up. \" I support this mission and space exploration 100%. We need to keep driving forward to up and out there, no matter what happens down here.",

If your heart and drive is there, you can do it. I would love to be maintenance around it. I would like to see space as our new industrial age and leave the manufacturing to 3rd world nations..we should have already be alot further than we are now. But companies are to busy chasing a green back, instead of a real dream.",
