But to fill people in, Geese normally all migrate South for the Winter - About twenty years ago, half of them ceased to migrate. They now over winter. And the numbers of Geese who over-winter has been increasing yearly. Same for quite a few other birds. When I was a kid and a young man, I never saw Robins in the Winter - Dave",
