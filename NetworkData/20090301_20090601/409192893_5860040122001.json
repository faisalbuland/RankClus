He modded decidedly left each and every day, threatening and punishing conservative members whenever he could invent an excuse for doing so, and letting liberal members get away with metaphorical murder. So, yes, I'm glad he's gone.. but he's pulled this $hit before, (getting all butt-hurt for some imagined slight and having his account removed). He'll most likely be back.

I, (and many others on this thread), was actually an active member of this forum back when uhler was a moderator here. He was the most biased and unprofessional forum mod I've ever seen, on any board. He had no ability to act objectively in his position as a mod. He modded decidedly left each and every day, threatening and punishing conservative members whenever he could invent an excuse for doing so, and letting liberal members get away with metaphorical murder. So, yes, I'm glad he's gone.. but he's pulled this $hit before, (getting all butt-hurt for some imagined slight and having his account removed). He'll most likely be back.",
