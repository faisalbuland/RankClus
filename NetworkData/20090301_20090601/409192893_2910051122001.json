There are many ways to evaluate problems and unless you look at them from different prospectives your view will be limited to that which is taught you. People must be equipped to look beyond the spoken word and consider the intent of the message being conveyed. That can only be done if a situation is evaluated from all possible perspectives.",

Not forgetting of course that many interrogators agree that torture is flawed; that there are other methods which are more successful. Not to mention legal. WSJ.COM: The terrorist Abu Zubaydah (sometimes derided as a low-level operative of questionable reliability, but who was in fact close to KSM and other senior al Qaeda leaders) disclosed some information voluntarily. But he was coerced into disclosing information that led to the capture of Ramzi bin al Shibh, another of the planners of Sept. 11, who in turn disclosed information which -- when combined with what was learned from Abu Zubaydah -- helped lead to the capture of KSM and other senior terrorists, and the disruption of follow-on plots aimed at both Europe and the U.S. Details of these successes, and the methods used to obtain them, were disclosed repeatedly in more than 30 congressional briefings and hearings beginning in 2002, and open to all members of the Intelligence Committees of both Houses of Congress beginning in September 2006. Any protestation of ignorance of those details, particularly by members of those committees, is pretense.",

You're willing to walk up to your son or daughter or wife or husband and say: Sorry honey, you've got to die..because I'm not willing to keep a terrorist awake long enough to get anwsers? Chilling. The whole idea behind that question is a fallacy. There is no proof that torture has saved lives. Additionally, these questions always assume that some plot is afoot in which we'd always capture someone who'd always have the key to unraveling the plot; and they would always not talk unless we tortured them. There are just too many assumtions here. Criminals in America kill more people every year than terrorists ever have. We do not torture them even though they are a greater threat to American lives. The US military does not torture people because it invites reprisals. Our enemies do not always treat our people well. However, the difference between us and our enemies is our fundemental goodness, our respect for laws, stability, and human rights. Torture undermines our reputation. It puts more people at risk.

Hey now, that's not only not fair but your not being nice and following the rules of engagement either! This particular enemy has a different set of thinking all together in his brain. Like the pirates who say they set out to not kill anyone. Just rob them, give me a break! how much money and time of one or two countries are we using up to adhere to the right way and the wrong way. I was happy the pres gave the go ahead to take out those three pirates to free the Capitain and yet what a mess erupted afterwards. This is me, if I were in the boat with the pirates and I am privy to the way thing go down. I woudl like to get rescued but if not rescuing me nipped this is in the bud and maybe made it better for the next ship. I say toss soemthing my way and take me out with them. As for the Islamic Terrorist, Yeah, we need a hero. Dam, where's the Fantastic four when you need them and the rest of those guys too. I gotta go c ya : )",
