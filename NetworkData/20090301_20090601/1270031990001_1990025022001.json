To understand that He lives inside of me and I am a part of Him that transcends the dying of the body and am forever alive in unity with Him is the greatest gift of understanding that I have been given through my knowing Him. This is the celebration of Easter, the Resurrection of the body and the knowing of our future path after death in union with Jesus Christ The Son to The Father.

I find it does not matter what you do, in what industry... Times are tough! I was looking for a way to motivate myself even in these tough times, it slowly came to me... When have times been tougher? The great depression, 1942, 2001! There was a time much, much worse. Imagine leaving everything, changing your life for a man who promised the unusual, yet spoke with crystal clarity and truth. Then watching him die along with all of your dreams, proving your choices where wrong, on the day we remember as Good Friday! With all hope lost these believers, this small group who had sacraficed all, heard and then found this man had risen from his grave! Turning lost hope from despair into salvation for not just that small group, but for all! An incredible turn of events. Easter 09 is yet again, maybe even more so now than before, the start of something new. A new beginning. Just like it has been all along! This year we just understand it better as we too, experience despair and some loss of hope. Maybe we can better appreciate what this day really means, the day despair became overcome forever...
