I'm contemplating beating it to death with my spade when I hear a different sort of yowl from behind me and there's my Tabby, hackles up, fangs bared, and fully hunched! That Junk-yard dog sauntered over toward my Cat and I thought that now I will have to kill this dog to protect my Cat. The Dog got almost to the Cat and she reared up and did several quick rakes of her claws across his snout almost to fast to follow. All I heard was a yelp and that Dog took off like a shot for home with my cat chasing it all the way! I ended up having to save that dog from my cat!
