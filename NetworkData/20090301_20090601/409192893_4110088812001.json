The bailouts only benefit few in America, even though lots of people around the world will be affected negatively by it. It's a huge mess we are getting deeper and deeper in. I just hope we can get out of it without a major war. I disagree. Some institutions were allowed to get too big. Failure of these institutions will devastate the economy much more than deficits will. Government spending is required to make up for the lack of consumer spending. Someone has to buy these goods and services and if the consumer isn't then the government has to. Failure to do so will only lead to further job loss and less consumer spending. It will be a downward spiral.",

Complain til the cows come home somewhere else. You don't have to like what's going on but unless you have a better idea no one cares about your opinion.", 
        "reply": " Oh, I'm not leaving. I'm staying and fighting the socialist commies trying to destroy my Country. And as expected, that's going to include a lot of lazy, welfare-minded, government teet sucking idiots who can't make it one their own, so they want someone else to provide for them. \"The World's Finest\"",

At some point you need to take a step back and take a critical look Obama and what he is doing. Of course the EU has there own agenda, however it one of the biggest complaints about Bush is now the same complaint about Obama (or worse!) then you need to acknowledge there is a problem..or be loss all creidtability and end up another scott..",
