Joe was a pilot and flew a Jet Ranger helicopter. Joe past away last year from a heart attack. I knew Joe not only from working law enforcement missions but we played together on a charity football team to raise money for the athletic programs of the high schools in the FL Keys. The last time I saw him was on TV. He was flying a FWC Jet Ranger in an episode of \"CSI Miami\". Bob Beckett, Monroe County Sheriff's Detective (FL Keys). Bob worked with us countless nights on the US Customs boats and a number of seizures on land. Bob volunteered to work in Bosnia. One morning, he did not show up for a meeting. When they went to check on him, he had died of a heart attack in the shower. I believe he was 39 at the time. Mark Anna'belle, Mark was a Marine Enforcement Officer assigned to the Key Largo Marine Unit. I worked with him a number of years. Unfortunately, Mark got hooked on Oxyconton and eventually overdosed. I hate that I never got to know this Monroe County Deputy enough to be able to remember his name. He had been a LT with Dade County Sheriff's Office (Miami) but transferred to the Monroe County S.O. as a Deputy. All the guys said he never EVER pulled any attitude about starting over at the bottom. This Deputy pulled out in front of an 18 wheeler one evening in Key Largo. He died instantly leaving behind a wife, a young son and young daughter. There must have been 150+ LEO's from every agency in South Florida that attended his funeral. And finally, the Supervisory Agent that was in Marathon, FL. Sadly, another who I didn't get to know well enough to remember his name. He was facing some pretty risky surgery and was told he may not survive. The poor guy was in severe pain all the time. He took his life with a shotgun. Remember all the LEO's who have lost their lives. We had an Officer close by in Manchester, NH. He had saved some homeless guy's life a few years back. Then last year, that same homeless guy fatally shot the officer. The local news told of how this officer dedicated himself to the safety of the homeless. Don",
