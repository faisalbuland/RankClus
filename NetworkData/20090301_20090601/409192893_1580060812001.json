It played right into Putin's hands. He leads a culture that often views strength and the ability to act brutally when needed, as a virtue. She obviously did not care or understand what she was doing. My advice to the Secretary of State when dealing with an Evil Empire who cherishes brutal force and simplicity is to stop with all the cutesy little jokes and be brutally forceful.

I think it was two years ago when she claimed (rightfully, but foolishly so) \u201cThis is the president that looked into the soul of Putin, I could have told him, he was a KGB agent, by definition he doesn\u2019t have a soul.\" To which Putin replied: \"At a minimum, a head of state should have a head,\". Ouch. Way to publicly set the stage for future relationships Madam Secretary. She did it to malign Bush. Her little joke's real effect was to further dent the relations between the US and Russia. It played right into Putin's hands. He leads a culture that often views strength and the ability to act brutally when needed, as a virtue. She obviously did not care or understand what she was doing. My advice to the Secretary of State when dealing with an Evil Empire who cherishes brutal force and simplicity is to stop with all the cutesy little jokes and be brutally forceful. Call Evil \"Evil\" and then have done with it. It's worked in the past.",
