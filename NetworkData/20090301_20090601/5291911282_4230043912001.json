I have been hammered with the propaganda that it is the Iraq war and the war on terror that is bankrupting us. I now find that to be RIDICULOUS. I hope the following 14 reasons are forwarded over and over again until they are read so many times that the reader gets sick of reading them. I have included the URLs for verification of all the following facts. 1. $11 Billion to $22 billion is spent on welfare to illegal aliens each year by state governments.

Verify at: \"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/01/ldt.01.HTML\" 10. The illegal aliens in the United States have a crime rate that's two and a half times that of white non-illegal aliens. In particular, their children, are going to make a huge additional crime problem in the US. Verify at:\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/12/ldt.01.html\" 11. During the year of 2005 there were 4 to 10 MILLION illegal aliens that crossed our Southern Border also, as many as 19,500 illegal aliens from Terrorist Countries.

Verify at: \"http: //www.drdsk.com/articleshtml\" The total cost is a whopping $ 338.3 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. More simply put, in just over 2 years without the illegal alien stanglehold on our economy, the current Wall Street crisis and the proposed $700 billion bailout would be paid for, without a cent of tax of US citizens! Are we THAT stupid? If this doesn't bother you then just delete the message. If, on the other hand, it does raise the hair on the back of your neck, I hope you forward it to every legal resident in the country including every representative in Washington, D.C. - five times a week for as long as it takes to restore some semblance of intelli gence in our policies and enforcement thereof.
