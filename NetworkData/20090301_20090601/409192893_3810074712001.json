        "content": "Barack Obama may subject US troops to International Criminal Court Posted By: Gerald Warner at Mar 6, 2009 at 11:27:15 Telegraph.co.uk Excerpt: They are feeling good just now at The Hague, as the judges and pen-pushers of the International Criminal Court (ICC) adjourn to smart restaurants to celebrate the latest gesture-politics flexing of their muscles by issuing an arrest warrant for Omar al Bashir, the President of Sudan. They are feeling less good in Darfur, from which 10 international aid agencies were expelled in retaliation within four hours of the ICC initiative, cutting food supplies and closing clinics. One man's ego trip is another man's starvation. But the people who should be feeling really nervous about this development are the citizens of the United States and more especially their armed forces. The signs are that the grandstanding Barack Obama is preparing to subject the United States to the jurisdiction of the ICC. In May, 2002 President Bush withdrew the United States from the Rome Statute which established the ICC. With America heading into global conflict, he had no wish to see US troops arraigned for alleged war crimes before a kangaroo court. That was a wise decision and probably required in terms of the US Constitution. Already, however, the Obama administration is sending out very different messages. America helped defeat a proposal that the warrant for Bashir should be suspended for 12 months - which would have been a welcome respite for the soup kitchens of Darfur. This is a policy change of considerable significance. Nor is it the only straw in the wind. Last month US Ambassador Susan Rice, in a closed meeting of the Security Council, supported the ICC, saying it \"looks to become an important and credible instrument for trying to hold accountable the senior leadership responsible for atrocities committed in the Congo, Uganda and Darfur\". A week later Ben Chang, spokesman for National Security Advisor General James Jones, took a similar line, telling the Washington Times: \"We support the ICC in its pursuit of those who've perpetrated war crimes.\" The next logical step is for the United States to sign up to the ICC. That would flatter Obama's ego as the conscience of the world. It would also put US servicemen at the mercy of any American-hating opportunists who might choose to arraign them on trumped-up charges before an alien court whose judges are likely to be ill-disposed towards America too.",

There have always been international regulations the troops had to follow anyway. And the likes of the perpetrators at Abu Ghraib should have been prosecuted. So should the senior leadership. So should individual troops who broke the laws and did war crimes. I actually took the time to read your entire post 3 times, and I changed my mind. I think the real intention is to undo many of G.W. Bush's terrible policies, which allowed Abu Ghraib to happen in the first place. My reading of this article leaves me to conclude that the intent is no disrespect to the US troops. Bush's policies are the real targets. I support what Obama is doing 200%. In my previous post, I went by the title of this thread. I scimmed over the article, and when I saw the word pen pushers, I thought the intent was to degrade the entire war effort, including the people fighting it.

The U.S. Marine Corps in a statement acknowledged the detention but didn't mention Hadnott. The statement said the corps was investigating the incident. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said it lodged an official protest with the United States. The incident was reported Sunday in the Chanton entertainment district on Okinawa, CNN said. \"This type of crime violates the human rights of women.

They are feeling less good in Darfur, from which 10 international aid agencies were expelled in retaliation within four hours of the ICC initiative, cutting food supplies and closing clinics. One man's ego trip is another man's starvation. But the people who should be feeling really nervous about this development are the citizens of the United States and more especially their armed forces. The signs are that the grandstanding Barack Obama is preparing to subject the United States to the jurisdiction of the ICC. In May, 2002 President Bush withdrew the United States from the Rome Statute which established the ICC. With America heading into global conflict, he had no wish to see US troops arraigned for alleged war crimes before a kangaroo court. That was a wise decision and probably required in terms of the US Constitution. Already, however, the Obama administration is sending out very different messages. America helped defeat a proposal that the warrant for Bashir should be suspended for 12 months - which would have been a welcome respite for the soup kitchens of Darfur. This is a policy change of considerable significance. Nor is it the only straw in the wind. Last month US Ambassador Susan Rice, in a closed meeting of the Security Council, supported the ICC, saying it \"looks to become an important and credible instrument for trying to hold accountable the senior leadership responsible for atrocities committed in the Congo, Uganda and Darfur\". A week later Ben Chang, spokesman for National Security Advisor General James Jones, took a similar line, telling the Washington Times: \"We support the ICC in its pursuit of those who've perpetrated war crimes.\" The next logical step is for the United States to sign up to the ICC. That would flatter Obama's ego as the conscience of the world. It would also put US servicemen at the mercy of any American-hating opportunists who might choose to arraign them on trumped-up charges before an alien court whose judges are likely to be ill-disposed towards America too.",

We ARE the UN. Part of being you're own nation IS getting to decide what international laws we follow. NO ONE. NO ONE outside this country has any right or ability to decide OUR laws. The very notion that we are NOT subject to the laws of any body outside our government is something this nation was FOUNDED on. Sorry Charley we may be the UN however we have subjected ourselves to it via Treaty. Treaties ratified by the Congress even pre-empt the Constitution and are the law of the land. So they do get to decide our laws and unless we are willing to revoke any or all treaties regard the UN we should be subject to the ICC. Simplest solution, renounce the UN and become a Rogue Nation per the UN. As if they could do anything about it without our support and monies. Frisco",

The notion that anyone thinks a U.S. soldier should be subject to the whims of the member nations of the UN is beyond me. No treaty, no law, nothing will ever diminish the RIGHT of the U.S. to do as she sees fit to defend herself, nor will it ever limit the RIGHT of the soldier to defend himself.",

Well that makes a lot of sense. You're going to get EXACTLY what you deserve. Ever heard of a Status Of Forces Agreement.!! A Big O retort? I've seen it all. Read and Weep! PREFACE The United States of America and the Republic of Iraq - which will hereafter be referred to as the two parties - recognize the importance of strengthening their joint security and participating in global peace and stability, fighting terrorism in Iraq and cooperating in the fields of security and defense to deter aggression and threats directed towards the sovereignty and unity of Iraq and its constitutional, federal, democratic system; They hereby confirm that this cooperation is built upon the basis of mutual respect for each other's full sovereignty and according to the objectives and principles of the UN mandate; And according to the wish of both parties to reach a mutual understanding to enhance cooperation between them; Without encroaching upon the sovereignty of Iraq, upon its soil, water or airspace, and upon the basis of being two independent, equal states of sovereignty, have agreed to the following: Article One Scope and Purpose This agreement defines the basic rules and requirements that regulate the temporary presence of the American Forces in Iraq, their activities in it and their withdrawal from Iraq. Article Two Definition of Terms \"The installations and areas agreed upon\" refers to the Iraqi areas used by the U.S. Forces while this agreement is valid.\" \"U.S. Forces\" refers to the entity that includes all the personnel of the American Armed Forces, the civilian personnel connected to them and all their possessions, installations and equipment present on Iraqi territory. \"Member of the U.S. Forces\" refers to any person that belongs to the army of the United States, its navy, air force, marine force or coast guard. \"Civilian element member\" refers to any civilian working for the U.S. Department of Defense. And this term does not include the personnel usually resident in Iraq. Contractors with the U.S government\" and \"those who work for the contractors with the United States of America\" refer to the legal non-Iraqi persons or entities and their workers who are either American citizens or third country citizens present in Iraq to provide commodities, services and security for the U.S. Forces or on behalf of them, in Iraq, according to a contract or a sub-contract with or for the U.S. Forces. These two terms do not include the legal persons or entities usually resident upon Iraqi soil. \"Official vehicles\" refers to the commercial vehicles that may be modified for security purposes, and that are designed originally to transport individuals on different terrains. \"Military vehicles\" refers to all manner of vehicles used by the U.S. Forces that were originally designed for combat operations and carry special distinctive numbers and signs. \"Defense equipment\" refers to the systems, weapons, ammunition, supplies and materials used in traditional warfare exclusively, that the U.S. needs in connection to the activities agreed upon in this agreement, and that are not related directly or indirectly to the weapons of mass destruction systems (chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, radiological weapons, biological weapons and the wastes connected to such weapons). \"Storing\" refers to keeping the defense equipment that the U.S. needs in relation to its activities agreed upon in this agreement. \"Taxes and charges\" refers to all the taxes and charges (including customs tariffs) and all charges of any kind that the Iraqi government, its establishments or provinces levies in accordance with the Iraqi laws and regulations. This term does not refer to the funds that are collected by the Iraqi government, its establishments or provinces for services requested by and rendered to the U.S Forces. Article 3 The Laws U.S. troops and the members of the civilian element commit to the necessity of respecting Iraqi laws, customs, traditions and conventions while conducting military operations in accordance with this agreement, and will refrain from any activities that are not compatible with the spirit of this agreement. The U.S. is obliged to take all the necessary measures for this purpose. With the exception of U.S. troops and the members of the civilian element, it is not permitted for the U.S. to transport anyone into Iraq or out of it on board the ships or aircraft included in this agreement unless in accordance with valid Iraqi laws and regulations including any executive arrangements that the Iraqi government may agree to. Article 4 The Missions The Iraqi government requests temporary assistance from the U.S. Forces to support its efforts in keeping peace and stability in Iraq, including cooperation in conducting operations against al Qaida and other terrorist groups and outlaw groups and the remnants of former regime. All military operations conducted in accordance with this agreement are conducted with the approval of the government of Iraq. Full coordination will take place with the Iraqi authorities regarding these operations and the Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee (JMOCC), which is to be formed according to this agreement, is to supervise the coordination of all the military operations. Any issues regarding proposed military operations that the Committee cannot resolve will be referred to the Joint Ministerial Committee. All these operations will be conducted with the necessity of fully respecting the Iraqi Constitution and Iraqi Law, and conducting these operations will be without overstepping the sovereignty of Iraq and its national interests as determined by the Iraqi government. It is the duty of the U.S. to respect the laws of Iraq, its customs and traditions and valid international law. The two parties will continue their efforts to enhance Iraq's security capabilities, as agreed upon by both sides, including training, provision, support, supply, building and updating logistic systems, including transport, accommodations and provisions for the Iraqi security forces. Both parties retain the right to legitimate self defense within Iraq as is described in valid international law. Article 5 Ownership of Property Iraq owns all the buildings and installations, the nontransferable structures on the ground that are located in the areas and installations agreed upon, including those the U.S. utilizes, constructs, changes or improves. At withdrawal, the U.S. will return all the installations and the agreed upon areas allocated for the use of the U.S. combat forces according to two lists (of inventory) to the Iraqi government. The first of these is to be submitted covering the installations and agreed upon areas as soon as the agreement is implemented. And the other list is to be submitted no later than June 30, 2009, the appointed date for U.S. Forces withdrawal from cities, towns and villages. And the Iraqi government has the right to permit the U.S. Forces to use some necessary installations for this agreement's purposes at withdrawal. The U.S. bears all the costs of building, modification or renovation in the installations and agreed upon areas allocated for their exclusive use. The U.S. will consult with the Iraqi government as to building, modification or renovation works and must seek the approval of the Iraqi government regarding major modifications and construction projects. And in cases of joint utilization of installations and agreed upon areas, both parties will bear the cost of construction, modification or renovation according to the percentage of use. The U.S. will bear the cost of the services it requests and receives in the installations and agreed upon areas for its exclusive use. And both parties will bear the cost for requested and received services in the installations and agreed upon areas and according to percentage of each party's use. When a historical or cultural site is discovered, or a strategic resource is found within the installations and agreed upon areas, all construction, modification and innovation works are to stop immediately, and the Iraqi representatives in the Committee are to be informed in order to determine the appropriate steps in regard to it. The U.S shall return the installations and agreed upon areas and any other installations, or non-transportable structures that it erected, fixed or used during the validity of this agreement according to mechanisms and priorities defined by the Joint Committee; and these installations and areas are to be returned to the Iraqi government free of debts and any financial obligations. The U.S. Forces shall return to the Iraqi government the installations and agreed upon areas of traditional, moral and political importance and any other fixed structures that the U.S. Forces may have built, assembled, or installed according to mechanisms and priorities and a time period to be agreed upon in the Joint Committee, and with no financial obligations. The U.S. shall return the rest of the installations and agreed upon areas to the Iraqi government when the validity of this agreement comes to an end or when it is terminated, or at any time prior to that, agreed upon by the two parties, or when the U.S. no longer needs the installations in accordance to what the Committee decrees, without debt or financial obligations. The U.S. and the contractors with the U.S. retain the ownership of all the equipment, materials, supplies, transportable installations and other transportable property imported to Iraq or acquired in Iraq legitimately and in connection to this agreement. Article 6 Usage of the Installations and the Agreed Upon Areas With full respect for the sovereignty of Iraq, in the framework of exchanging points of view between the two parties regarding this agreement, Iraq guarantees that the U.S. Forces and contractors with the U.S Forces and the workers employed by these contractors and the personnel and other entities can reach and use the installations and agreed upon areas according to what both parties agree upon. Iraq permits the U.S. Forces, according to this agreement, to exercise inside the installations and agreed upon areas all rights and authorities that may be necessary to build, use and secure these installations and agreed upon areas. Both parties are to coordinate and cooperate as to how these rights and authorities may be practiced in the installations and agreed upon areas that are joint utilities. The U.S Forces control the entrances to the installations and agreed upon areas that are allocated for their exclusive use. Both parties are to coordinate the control of the installations and agreed upon areas of joint use, and according to mechanisms approved by the Joint Committee to coordinate joint military operations. Both parties are to coordinate the guard missions in the areas adjacent to the installations and the agreed upon areas through the Joint Committee for coordination of military operations.

They are feeling less good in Darfur, from which 10 international aid agencies were expelled in retaliation within four hours of the ICC initiative, cutting food supplies and closing clinics. One man's ego trip is another man's starvation. But the people who should be feeling really nervous about this development are the citizens of the United States and more especially their armed forces. The signs are that the grandstanding Barack Obama is preparing to subject the United States to the jurisdiction of the ICC. In May, 2002 President Bush withdrew the United States from the Rome Statute which established the ICC. With America heading into global conflict, he had no wish to see US troops arraigned for alleged war crimes before a kangaroo court. That was a wise decision and probably required in terms of the US Constitution. Already, however, the Obama administration is sending out very different messages. America helped defeat a proposal that the warrant for Bashir should be suspended for 12 months - which would have been a welcome respite for the soup kitchens of Darfur. This is a policy change of considerable significance. Nor is it the only straw in the wind. Last month US Ambassador Susan Rice, in a closed meeting of the Security Council, supported the ICC, saying it \"looks to become an important and credible instrument for trying to hold accountable the senior leadership responsible for atrocities committed in the Congo, Uganda and Darfur\". A week later Ben Chang, spokesman for National Security Advisor General James Jones, took a similar line, telling the Washington Times: \"We support the ICC in its pursuit of those who've perpetrated war crimes.\" The next logical step is for the United States to sign up to the ICC. That would flatter Obama's ego as the conscience of the world. It would also put US servicemen at the mercy of any American-hating opportunists who might choose to arraign them on trumped-up charges before an alien court whose judges are likely to be ill-disposed towards America too.",

Bush's policies are the real targets. I support what Obama is doing 200%. In my previous post, I went by the title of this thread. I scimmed over the article, and when I saw the word pen pushers, I thought the intent was to degrade the entire war effort, including the people fighting it.

Bush's terrible policies, which allowed Abu Ghraib to happen in the first place. My reading of this article leaves me to conclude that the intent is no disrespect to the US troops. Bush's policies are the real targets. I support what Obama is doing 200%. In my previous post, I went by the title of this thread. I scimmed over the article, and when I saw the word pen pushers, I thought the intent was to degrade the entire war effort, including the people fighting it. So I edited my post after a careful reading of the article. This message has been edited. Last edited by: cybercafe, Tue 10 March 2009 04:43 PM",

Masaaki Takahashi, 61, was found dead in his taxi with stabs wounds in his neck, police officials said. The arrested sailor was identified by the Police in Kanagawa, near Tokyo, as Olatunbosun Ugbogu, 22. Apparently, he robbed the taxi driver and then he killed him. \u201cDespite such incidents, the Japan-U.S. alliance will not be shaken,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura declared, quoted by Reuters. \u201cBut to be able to maintain and develop a firm U.S.-Japan alliance, we will seek a sound response by the American side,\u201d he added at a news conference. Ugbogu, who is a Nigerian national, was in U.S. military custody on a charge of dissertation and was handed over to Japanese police by accord with U.S. authorities. \u201cI want to express to you the heartfelt regret that all of us feel. This was a tragic incident. It puts a stain on all of us who try to serve America here in Japan,\u201d U.S. ambassador Thomas Schieffer told Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura. It appears that last month, a U.S. Marine was arrested on suspicion of raping a 14-year-old girl, and thousand of residents of the southern island of Okinawa demanded a smaller U.S. military presence in the prefecture. However, the charges were dropped, as the girl withdrew her complaints. Four other U.S. Marines from a base in Japan face court martial due to charges of the rape of a Japanese woman. Okinawa politicians and Japanese opposition parties asked that the agreement on U.S. military personnel be revised in order to give Japanese authorities bigger legal jurisdiction. Until now, both Tokyo and Washington rejected the demand. Public concern is rising in Japan over America\u2019s 50,000 military based in the country with troops facing allegations from rapes to alcohol-related incidents, the Associated Press reports.",

Masaaki Takahashi, 61, was found dead in his taxi with stabs wounds in his neck, police officials said. The arrested sailor was identified by the Police in Kanagawa, near Tokyo, as Olatunbosun Ugbogu, 22. Apparently, he robbed the taxi driver and then he killed him. \u201cDespite such incidents, the Japan-U.S. alliance will not be shaken,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura declared, quoted by Reuters. \u201cBut to be able to maintain and develop a firm U.S.-Japan alliance, we will seek a sound response by the American side,\u201d he added at a news conference. Ugbogu, who is a Nigerian national, was in U.S. military custody on a charge of dissertation and was handed over to Japanese police by accord with U.S. authorities. \u201cI want to express to you the heartfelt regret that all of us feel. This was a tragic incident. It puts a stain on all of us who try to serve America here in Japan,\u201d U.S. ambassador Thomas Schieffer told Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura. It appears that last month, a U.S. Marine was arrested on suspicion of raping a 14-year-old girl, and thousand of residents of the southern island of Okinawa demanded a smaller U.S. military presence in the prefecture. However, the charges were dropped, as the girl withdrew her complaints. Four other U.S. Marines from a base in Japan face court martial due to charges of the rape of a Japanese woman. Okinawa politicians and Japanese opposition parties asked that the agreement on U.S. military personnel be revised in order to give Japanese authorities bigger legal jurisdiction. Until now, both Tokyo and Washington rejected the demand. Public concern is rising in Japan over America\u2019s 50,000 military based in the country with troops facing allegations from rapes to alcohol-related incidents, the Associated Press reports.",
