Every thing that I've seen over the years including on the big three, ABC, CBS, and NBC, the majority have been held by the libs in one form or another. So why are they getting so bent and tweaked about a little teaparty? Lets see, they've had anti-war, draftcard-burning, bra-burning, anti-war, gay-pride, million-man, gay-pride, anti-war, gay-pride, WTO, Pink and the list goes on. Anyone else see a little redudency here. Hell, I can't remember the last protest that the right held. Not saying that they did'nt, just can't remember, somebody refresh my memory. And yet a group of Americans from both side and all groups and races gets together and has a little teaparty and want to pitch a bi@@h about the guberment and suddenly we are Extremist and Racist, man, WTFs up wit dat, makes you just wanna go HMMMMMMMM.... or ARRRGGHHH!!!",
