If you are PCSing overseas the Redskins will not allow you to cancel your contract or allow you to postpone your season tickets until you return to an area where you are able to travel to Redskins games. The three year contract is non-negotiable even for members of the military. Just a heads up to anyone else that runs into this issue. So much for supporting the troops.",
