They are $140 million for each one past what is already ordered. The 187 we already ordered cost $361 million each, much of which was an R&D cost. They are a defense project that has gone overtime and over-budget. Something needs to clean up the way contractors run the DoD. Big contractors are rewarded for taking too long and spending too much. They know it takes so long for major projects that they can get away with whatever they want because the military wants the final product. Considering that at least three F-22s have already crashed it already has one of the worst safety records in the Air Force. There is no reason to buy more of them, they are merely a waste of our tax dollars. And you have worked in the aerospace industry where?... Respectfully, SUNLINER81 In the Air Force. Did you know those are the people that have to actually use the equipment?", 
        "reply": " What I was referring to was on the \"contract\" side of procurement... I too served in the active military aviation branch of the U.S.N. AND I worked for Lockheed, Douglas, Northrop and BAE, in all aspects of contractual negotiations, as a \"Provisioning Analyst\" and on the \"assembly line\"... The point is, aircraft are \"long lead time\" items and they are built to specifications to meet actual and projected hostile forces... It take from eight to twelve years from concept, proposal, test and evaluation, to prototypes, to actual \"article in service\"... The point was and is, if we don't procure these fighters and strike aircraft now, we wont' have time to do it, when and if the schidt hits the fan AND THEN, PEOPLE WILL DIE BECAUSE WE WERE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
