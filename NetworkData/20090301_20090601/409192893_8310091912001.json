Does the KKK, Timothy McVeigh or Eric Rudolph ring any for you? President Truman and Senator Byrd, both Democrats, were members of the klan. In 1924, Harry S. Truman was a judge in Jackson County, Missouri, which includes Kansas City. Truman was up for reelection, and his friends Edgar Hinde and Spencer Salisbury advised him to join the Klan. The Klan was politically powerful in Jackson County, and two of Truman's opponents in the Democratic primary had Klan support. Truman refused at first, but paid the Klan's $10 membership fee, and a meeting with a Klan officer was arranged.

Not really a factor with those guys, so we default back to your exalted Grand Kleagle from West Virginia.

Do I really need to ask which party is closer to the principles which launched that movement? Here's a clue, and I won't charge you for it. Your party is over. The whole \"racist white Republican\" thing is over. Why? Because white alleged Republicans elected your candidate to represent the country in its highest office.

Its purpose was to restore white supremacy in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The Klan resisted Reconstruction by intimidating freedmen and white Republicans, members of the abolitionist movement. The KKK quickly adopted violent methods. The increase in murders finally resulted in a backlash among Southern elites who viewed the Klan's excesses as an excuse for federal troops to continue occupation. Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of antiblack vigilante groups, disgruntled poor white farmers, wartime guerrilla bands, displaced Democratic politicians, illegal whiskey distillers, coercive moral reformers, sadists, rapists, white workmen fearful of black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few freedmen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and Democratic, was that they called themselves, or were called, Klansmen.[16] Cartoon from 1868, which accuses the Democratic party presidential candidates of relying on support from Ku Klux Klan members who were Confederate traitors in 1864",

Does the KKK, Timothy McVeigh or Eric Rudolph ring any for you? President Truman and Senator Byrd, both Democrats, were members of the klan. In 1924, Harry S. Truman was a judge in Jackson County, Missouri, which includes Kansas City. Truman was up for reelection, and his friends Edgar Hinde and Spencer Salisbury advised him to join the Klan. The Klan was politically powerful in Jackson County, and two of Truman's opponents in the Democratic primary had Klan support. Truman refused at first, but paid the Klan's $10 membership fee, and a meeting with a Klan officer was arranged.

Not really a factor with those guys, so we default back to your exalted Grand Kleagle from West Virginia. Neither Rudolph nor McVeigh gave a rat's ass about whether or not the people they killed and maimed were black or white. They just simply didn't care. They made their statements, and the only relevant color was the red blood that they splattered. Their causes were not the causes of the Republican Party, and any overlap on the abortion issue was prima facie incidental. Timothy McVeigh was motivated by The Turner Diaries, a book written by a National Socialist. Do I really need to rehash the intellectual wellspring and roots of that movement? Do I really need to ask which party is closer to the principles which launched that movement? Here's a clue, and I won't charge you for it. Your party is over. The whole \"racist white Republican\" thing is over. Why? Because white alleged Republicans elected your candidate to represent the country in its highest office. So you may now stop sounding like some idiotic discredited talking point that went stale sometime around 1989. I know. That kinda sucks for you, because that means you need to relearn how to think independently.

Up is Down and Down is Up; we have always been at war with Oceana. You know what, forget the sympathy. I do not care what your background is, all I know is that you're a cheerleader for the nightmare your Messiah has planned for us. I've seen that nightmare before and do not need a rerun. You're quite happy with a boot permanently placed upon a human face as long as your foot is in the boot and the face belongs to someone else. Principle doesn't even factor into the equation. I'm not going to call you a fascist or a communist, because that would mean you are an active supporter of those systems. I do not believe that you are. But I do see you as the sort who would allow either one of those systems to prevail if it gave lip service to your pet causes--principles be damned.
