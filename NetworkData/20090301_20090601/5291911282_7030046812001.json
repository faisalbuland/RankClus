I say again, divert YOUR course.\" Canadians: \"No, I say again, you divert YOUR course.\" Americans: \"THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THE SECOND LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH.

After trying unsuccessfully to contact the pilots, U.S. fighter jets met up with the Russian planes and flew with them until they left the area, CNN reported. One incident occurred Monday, when Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft flew over the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis while it was in international waters in the Sea of Japan. The Russian aircraft flew within 500 feet of the carrier, which was lower than other Russian flyovers in the past year, military officials said. On Tuesday, two Russian long-range bombers overflew the Stennis and the USS Blue Ridge several times at about 2,000 feet, U.S. military officials told CNN. Military officials said U.S. aircraft tried contacting the Russian planes on international air frequency radio channels on both days but the Russian pilots didn't respond. An \"Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft\" is an attempt to copy out P-3 down to the rivets, and is anti-ship/sub capable: Russian American Don't forget the Russian shoot down of the Japanese airliner full of people, the Chinese force down of one of our P-3 spy craft, and the American shoot down of an Iranian airliner full of people by one of our Aegis Cruisers, who mistook it as an attacking Iranian F-14 - - Global examples of \"Playing Chicken\" happen all to often - - Wandering and Wondering",
