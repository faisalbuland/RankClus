Sea Salt would be what you really want if you are going to do this. It flushes you out in about 30-60 minutes. But, that is just your bowels. OP, just so you know, there is no way that you can lose 10 pounds of fat in that time. For the average person, if they ate absolutely no food for 14 days, they would just barely lose 9 or 10 pounds (a mixture of fat, water, muscle and feces). And, that is not feasible nor is it healthy. So, you will have to lose weight other ways. You can lose roughly 3-5 pounds of fat if you lower your caloric intake to about 2000 calories a day spaced out evenly over 6 small meals. You must eat in order to lose fat, otherwise your body will go into starvation mode and retain fat rather than shed it. Plus, not eating can cause harm to your body. So, make sure each meal has a lean protein sourse, a complex carbohydrate and a veggie in it. These things take more energy to digest than many other foods, thus burning more calories. Also, incorporate 30 minutes of moderate cardio per day into your daily routine. I personally like 20 minutes of HIIT for cardio, but I am too lazy to explain HIIT to you. Sorry. Drink more water than usual for all days except for the day you weigh in. The reason I am telling you to drink more water is because your body adapts to whatever stimulus you give it. By drinking more water everyday, your body will get the hint that water is not scarce and will retain less of it. When you wake up on the day of the weigh in, your body still thinks that it will get plenty of water, so you will be about 2 lbs lighter than normal, so don't drink anymore than a glass or two on the day of the weigh in. And, most importantly, do not eat on the day of the weigh in. On the day of your weigh in, take a mustard bath. A mustard bath opens up your pores and releases the oils in your skin. This only accounts for .5-1 lb, but it is better than nothing. Try to find a mustard bath mix that does not contain any other oils in it, otherwise it will defeat the purpose. About 2 hours before you leave your house for the weigh in drink one quart of warm water mixed with two heaping teaspoons of sea salt (your stomach should be empty, remember). This will cause you to evacuate any remaining feces that is in your bowels. The weight of this will probably be less than 2 pounds, but every little bit helps. Remember, cloths can account for almost 5 lbs and shoes a pound or two. So, make sure you get weighed in your underwear. Good luck! And, make sure you get a good meal and a decent amount of water after you weigh in. P.S. How much do you weigh? What is your bodyfat percentage. Because, for most people in the 170-230 pound range, my recommendation of 2000 calories a day is perfect. But, if you weigh more than that, add 400 calories a day. If you weigh less, subtract 400 calories a day from that. And, make sure the food you eat is natural food. Proteins should be lean steak (top sirloin, top round), any fish, skinless chicken breast, fat free cottage cheese, egg whites, etc. Complex carbs should be brown rice (no white rice), 100% whole wheat bread (no white bread or that multigrain bs), potatoes, fruits (not canned), sweet potatoes, cous cous, plain oatmeal, fat free yogurt, beans, wild rice, pasta. With the veggies stick mainly to the green ones (brussels sprouts, spinach, broccoli, peas, etc) . Also, do not use condiments, butter, margerine, oils, sugars, etc. Do not eat any meats or things such as shrimp that has any breading on it. You are fine to use spices, peppers, hot sauce, etc. You can even use ketchup, but do so very sparingly. The whole point of your meals should be that they are devoid of anything unnecessary. They give you the nutrients that you need without all of the BS. Also, even though I said to do 30 minutes of cardio a day, try to stay relatively active during the rest of the day. No being a couch potato. P.S.S. If in the future you want to know how to effectively lose weight the healthy way (by losing fat and retaining muscle) and improve your overall physical condition, get back to me. So far I have only shown you how to lose a lot of weight in lbs without causing undue harm to your health. But, losing weight is different than losing fat. You are still going to look the same after this. This message has been edited. Last edited by: 10Tenths, Tue 24 March 2009 12:08 AM",
