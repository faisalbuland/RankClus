Here's how things work in D.C. since you guys seem to be confused about this. president appoints someone to a position(in this case the head of the VA.) The president then tells that person what he wants done(include cat. 7 and 8 vets back into the system, lower the income threshold, etc..) Th person appointed then tries to see how it can be done and also proposes other ideas of his own. budgets and proposals go up and down the chain of command a few times until a something workable(and passable by congress) is reached. I'm having a hard time understanding why people assumes this was a proposal from Obama himself and not the head of the VA(or more likely someone working for the head of the VA). now as for your \"claimed he supported the Military\" how about the billions more he requested for the VA over the next 5 years and readmitting thousands that Bush cut out of the system? How is looking at a proposal that is never even close to being implemented take away from actually giving more funding to more vets? It's like being mad that your mommy thought about cooking brussel sprouts at some time in the future, and meanwhile you're eating cake and ice cream.",

        "reply": " Here's how things work in D.C. since you guys seem to be confused about this. president appoints someone to a position(in this case the head of the VA.) The president then tells that person what he wants done(include cat. 7 and 8 vets back into the system, lower the income threshold, etc..) Th person appointed then tries to see how it can be done and also proposes other ideas of his own. budgets and proposals go up and down the chain of command a few times until a something workable(and passable by congress) is reached. I'm having a hard time understanding why people assumes this was a proposal from Obama himself and not the head of the VA(or more likely someone working for the head of the VA). now as for your \"claimed he supported the Military\" how about the billions more he requested for the VA over the next 5 years and readmitting thousands that Bush cut out of the system? How is looking at a proposal that is never even close to being implemented take away from actually giving more funding to more vets? It's like being mad that your mommy thought about cooking brussel sprouts at some time in the future, and meanwhile you're eating cake and ice cream.",

Here's how things work in D.C. since you guys seem to be confused about this. president appoints someone to a position(in this case the head of the VA.) The president then tells that person what he wants done(include cat. 7 and 8 vets back into the system, lower the income threshold, etc..) Th person appointed then tries to see how it can be done and also proposes other ideas of his own. budgets and proposals go up and down the chain of command a few times until a something workable(and passable by congress) is reached. I'm having a hard time understanding why people assumes this was a proposal from Obama himself and not the head of the VA(or more likely someone working for the head of the VA). now as for your \"claimed he supported the Military\" how about the billions more he requested for the VA over the next 5 years and readmitting thousands that Bush cut out of the system? How is looking at a proposal that is never even close to being implemented take away from actually giving more funding to more vets? It's like being mad that your mommy thought about cooking brussel sprouts at some time in the future, and meanwhile you're eating cake and ice cream.",
