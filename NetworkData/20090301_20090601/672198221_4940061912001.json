Afghan President Hamid Karzai has long championed the idea of reconciliation with the Taliban as a key way to tamp down the growing insurgency in Afghanistan. The Bush administration generally opposed the idea, but President Barack Obama stressed reconciliation with more moderate elements of the Taliban when he presented the new U.S. strategy Friday. \"In a country with extreme poverty that has been at war for decades, there will also be no peace without reconciliation among former enemies,\" Obama said. The reconciliation proposal is the most novel part of the new plan, which is focused mostly on increasing the scale of ongoing initiatives \u2014 promising 4,000 additional troops to train the Afghan army, hundreds more civilian specialists to help Afghanistan rebuild and billions of dollars in civilian aid to neighboring Pakistan. Pakistan's president also welcomed the Obama administration's new policy to counter Al Qaeda as a \"positive change\" and insisted his country will not allow its territory to be used for terrorist attacks. <more> \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,511219,00.html\"",

President Bush never understood either, which is why after seven years of war in Afghanistan, the Taliban thank that they are winning and al Qaeda has safe haven in Packistan. President Obama seems to have a better grasp on the situation. \"David Kilcullen, a counterinsurgency expert who has advised Petraeus, says, \"I've had tribal leaders and Afghan government officials at the province and district level tell me that 90 percent of the people we call the Taliban are actually tribal fighters or Pashtun nationalists or people pursuing their own agendas. Less than 10 percent are ideologically aligned with the Quetta Shura [Mullah Omar's leadership group] or Al Qaeda.\" These people are, in his view, \"almost certainly reconcilable under some circumstances.\" Beyond Afghanistan, too, it is crucial that we adopt a more sophisticated strategy toward radical Islam. This should come naturally to President Obama, who spoke often on the campaign trail of the need for just such a differentiated approach toward Muslim countries. Even the Washington Institute, a think tank often associated with conservatives, appears onboard. It is issuing a report this week that recommends, among other points, that the United States use more \"nuanced, noncombative rhetoric\" that avoids sweeping declarations like \"war on terror,\" \"global insurgency,\" even \"the Muslim world.\" Anything that emphasizes the variety of groups, movements and motives within that world strengthens the case that this is not a battle between Islam and the West. Bin Laden constantly argues that all these different groups are part of the same global movement. We should not play into his hands, and emphasize instead that many of these forces are local, have specific grievances and don't have much in common. The veil is not the same as the suicide belt. We can better pursue our values if we recognize the local and cultural context, and appreciate that people want to find their own balance between freedom and order, liberty and license. In the end, time is on our side. Bin Ladenism has already lost ground in almost every Muslim country. Radical Islam will follow the same path. Wherever it is tried\u2014in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in parts of Nigeria and Pakistan\u2014people weary of its charms very quickly. The truth is that all Islamists, violent or not, lack answers to the problems of the modern world. They do not have a world view that can satisfy the aspirations of modern men and women. We do. That's the most powerful weapon of all.\" Fareed Zakaria, Feb 28, 2009",
