She may have ended up as a decent candidate on the national stage in the future but she was not ready in 2008 and she will never recover from the beating she's taken (and continues to take). Most of it is her and John McCain's fault, but it is also true that there was a fair amount of simple bias. I agree. She wasn't ready, period. She wasn't McCain's pick, he wanted to pick Lieberman. Republicans want someone they can relate to, and they don't relate to her. She's a follower, and not a leader. She would have failed miserably if for some reason McCain couldn't finish out his term, which is ultimately what cost her.",
