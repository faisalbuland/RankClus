Down here in Orange County CA. people have been waiting in line for two days to see Obama speak at the Orange County Fairgrounds. Yesterday he was in Ireland to celebrate ST.Patrick's day. When asked if they had anything to ask the President one young female admirer said \"Yes!\" When pressed as to what that question was, she looked rather lost, and after some hesitation said, \"I don't want to say.\" Another young female admirer admitted she wanted to ask the President what he was going to do for her generation...like jobs and stuff. No freaking wonder the campaign ad likening Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton touched a very big nerve, and \"required\" a response.",
