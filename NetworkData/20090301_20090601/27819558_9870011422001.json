Yeah, guess California doesn't need money as bad as they claim they do, 'cause they just lost out on a bunch! What a crock! In listening to the oral arguments, and reading all (groan) the paperwork, I was surprised to notice that NOBODY challenged the assertion that the change in the CA Constitution was merely one of the definition of the term \"marriage\". I could clearly see that it could have been argued that by \"defining\" in this manner 1) it had substantive legal consequences negatively effecting the excluded parties in over 1400 other legal and policy processes throughout the State, as well as in relation to the equal protection status of visitors or immigrants from other States where SSM is legal; and 2) that Prop.8 was not a mere redefinition due to it's sweeping effect through application of dependent laws, codes and subsequent policies. The majority and concurring opinions both have statements in them that seemed to me to be almost suggesting these and other avenues for further cases. Once again in my life, the heteros have relegated me and mine to the position of NI&&3% in my native land, which I have served, and to which I have contributed my time talents and resources every day of my life. P!$$ed-off doesn't even come close. New England winters are beginning to look mighty fine . . . if not Ontarian. Decision is here: -->http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S168047.PDF",

Former U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson, a renowned conservative, and David Boies, who opposed Olson in Bush v. Gore in the 2000 fight over the presidential election, cast their collaborative effort to restore the right of gays to marry in California as a moral imperative to correct an injustice. Their suit seeks an immediate injunction on Prop. 8's ban, thereby allowing same-sex marriages to resume while the case makes its way through the federal court system.
