I am sure you could get the same response and the same type of photos from about 75% of college kids on Spring Break any given March or April. hmmm against same sex marriages but poses topless again where is the connection???? Not like she was posing in LESBIAN photos ala Vanessa Williams whilst saying she is against same sex marriage.",

It is strictly prohibited to have entered the Miss California contest if you had ever posed for nude pictures at anytime during the past. It is also strictly prohibited that while you hold the title of Miss California you may NOT appear at any event or endorses anything without the expressed permission of the Miss California contest. According to the news reports she has violated her contract several times over and is in danger of losing her title of Miss California. That is what this is about, not what she said about at the pageant. Read the numerous news reports and you will be enlightened.",
