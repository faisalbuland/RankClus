        "reply": " The leftist idiots in DHS maybe wanted to publicize something, anything, to somehow discredit many who attended the TEA parties. It backfired. DHS need not pass GO and can go directly to hell, far as I'm concerned. I proudly qualify as one of their \"extremists.\" Ooooohhh--aaaaahhh. . . been one since the 1970s, I now see--and I don't give a damn what those obamanite fools and knaves blabber about. But what anybody with a brain can understand is that scarce resources are being urinated away on such polytickle control-freak nonsense while the real threats, islamonazis and druggies, appear to draw less attention than solid American citizens whose mistrust of the weenies in guvmint now seems all the more justified. Frickin' fools and knaves of the left. Had a military field grade commander been handed such a lousy, unfounded analysis by which to commit his unit to action, he'd have likely fired the incompetent daring to generate such unsubstantiated crap.",
