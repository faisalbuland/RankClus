When you were a student, you were not yet a scientist. However, I can speak from my own experience, even as a student, I was NEVER told to just accept scientific laws and mathematical theorems without testing them. The whole point is that ALL of science is based on evidence, and can be tested, questioned, and revised if new evidence is discovered. There is NO FAITH involved in science. You don't \"discover\" laws like uncovering some mysterious revealed truth.

The laws were treated as \"given\" \u2014 imprinted on the universe like a maker's mark at the moment of cosmic birth \u2014 and fixed forevermore. Therefore, to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour.", 
        "reply": " When you were a student, you were not yet a scientist. However, I can speak from my own experience, even as a student, I was NEVER told to just accept scientific laws and mathematical theorems without testing them. The whole point is that ALL of science is based on evidence, and can be tested, questioned, and revised if new evidence is discovered. There is NO FAITH involved in science. You don't \"discover\" laws like uncovering some mysterious revealed truth.

If stupid people use it, as they have religion, to further some sort of political agenda that places them at the center of their own contrived universe, that isn't Darwin's fault. Consider all the evil that's been perpetrated on this planet in the name of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. Does that invalidate Christianity?",

In science, a healthy skepticism is a professional necessity, whereas in religion, having belief without evidence is regarded as a virtue. The problem with this neat separation into \"non-overlapping magisteria,\" as Stephen Jay Gould described science and religion, is that science has its own faith-based belief system. All science proceeds on the assumption that nature is ordered in a rational and intelligible way. You couldn't be a scientist if you thought the universe was a meaningless jumble of odds and ends haphazardly juxtaposed. When physicists probe to a deeper level of subatomic structure, or astronomers extend the reach of their instruments, they expect to encounter additional elegant mathematical order. And so far this faith has been justified. The most refined expression of the rational intelligibility of the cosmos is found in the laws of physics, the fundamental rules on which nature runs. The laws of gravitation and electromagnetism, the laws that regulate the world within the atom, the laws of motion \u2014 all are expressed as tidy mathematical relationships. But where do these laws come from? And why do they have the form that they do? When I was a student, the laws of physics were regarded as completely off limits. The job of the scientist, we were told, is to discover the laws and apply them, not inquire into their provenance. The laws were treated as \"given\" \u2014 imprinted on the universe like a maker's mark at the moment of cosmic birth \u2014 and fixed forevermore. Therefore, to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour. Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are. The answers vary from \"that's not a scientific question\" to \"nobody knows.\" The favorite reply is, \"There is no reason they are what they are \u2014 they just are.\" The idea that the laws exist reasonlessly is deeply anti-rational. After all, the very essence of a scientific explanation of some phenomenon is that the world is ordered logically and that there are reasons things are as they are. If one traces these reasons all the way down to the bedrock of reality \u2014 the laws of physics \u2014 only to find that reason then deserts us, it makes a mockery of science.\" \"http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/davies07/davies07_index.html\"",

The job of the scientist, we were told, is to discover the laws and apply them, not inquire into their provenance. The laws were treated as \"given\" \u2014 imprinted on the universe like a maker's mark at the moment of cosmic birth \u2014 and fixed forevermore. Therefore, to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour. Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are. The answers vary from \"that's not a scientific question\" to \"nobody knows.\" The favorite reply is, \"There is no reason they are what they are \u2014 they just are.\" The idea that the laws exist reasonlessly is deeply anti-rational. After all, the very essence of a scientific explanation of some phenomenon is that the world is ordered logically and that there are reasons things are as they are. If one traces these reasons all the way down to the bedrock of reality \u2014 the laws of physics \u2014 only to find that reason then deserts us, it makes a mockery of science.\" \"http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/davies07/davies07_index.html\"",

So in the end 'scientific proof' amounts to little more than a series of elegant mathematical statements based on presuppositions that are, in reality, quite arbitrary in their origin. As the previous referenced article concludes: \"It seems to me there is no hope of ever explaining why the physical universe is as it is so long as we are fixated on immutable laws or meta-laws that exist reasonlessly or are imposed by divine providence. The alternative is to regard the laws of physics and the universe they govern as part and parcel of a unitary system, and to be incorporated together within a common explanatory scheme. In other words, the laws should have an explanation from within the universe and not involve appealing to an external agency. The specifics of that explanation are a matter for future research. But until science comes up with a testable theory of the laws of the universe, its claim to be free of faith is manifestly bogus.\"",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Whirled_Peas: But that's exactly right - science isn't supposed to answer \"WHY.\" It answers \"what, how, when, where, and by what means.\" It's a PROCESS of rational discovery, inquiry, and formulation of conclusions - not a simple unwrapping of nice, neat nuggets of ultimate truth. You can play with philosophy and religion all you want to satisfy your need to understand why, but that's not part of science. However, as time goes on, things once relegated to the realm of myth and faith are now solidly explained by scientifically testable laws and theories. Why does the moon go through phases every month? That used to be the subject of myth and faith, and something as simple as an eclipse was enough to cause ancient people to wonder if the gods had deserted them. We now can fully explain the movements and phases of the moon by the most basic principles of physics. Given enough time, plenty of things that most people still blindly cover with \"faith\" will be explained by science. Why is the universe the way it is? Can't tell you; talk to your preacher. How does the universe work? Look to the cutting edge of physics. Why are we here? That's between you and your god of choice. How did we get here? Try taking a few biology courses.", 
        "reply": " So in the end 'scientific proof' amounts to little more than a series of elegant mathematical statements based on presuppositions that are, in reality, quite arbitrary in their origin. As the previous referenced article concludes: \"It seems to me there is no hope of ever explaining why the physical universe is as it is so long as we are fixated on immutable laws or meta-laws that exist reasonlessly or are imposed by divine providence. The alternative is to regard the laws of physics and the universe they govern as part and parcel of a unitary system, and to be incorporated together within a common explanatory scheme. In other words, the laws should have an explanation from within the universe and not involve appealing to an external agency. The specifics of that explanation are a matter for future research. But until science comes up with a testable theory of the laws of the universe, its claim to be free of faith is manifestly bogus.\"",

Now if you had said: * Politics owns organized religion you would be correct because the leaders of organized religion use Politics to become leaders. * If you had said that people are using this religious issue for Politics you would also be correct. * If you had said that the people using this issue are playing \"the end justifies the means\" games and using what they KNOW are lies to push a religious view (and increase their power) you also be correct.",

The laws were treated as \"given\" \u2014 imprinted on the universe like a maker's mark at the moment of cosmic birth \u2014 and fixed forevermore. Therefore, to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour. When you were a student, you were not yet a scientist. However, I can speak from my own experience, even as a student, I was NEVER told to just accept scientific laws and mathematical theorems without testing them. The whole point is that ALL of science is based on evidence, and can be tested, questioned, and revised if new evidence is discovered. There is NO FAITH involved in science. You don't \"discover\" laws like uncovering some mysterious revealed truth. You observe patterns, propose and test hypothesis, formulate laws based on tests and observations, and finally create theories as the logical conclusion based on tested and reliable laws. We do not need to have faith that the universe is \"governed\" by anything. However, if you perform Test A of Substance B in Situation C, and the results are the same every single time, it is fair to CONCLUDE that a logical physical law will continue to describe the different aspects of the forces in question. quote: Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are. The answers vary from \"that's not a scientific question\" to \"nobody knows.\" The favorite reply is, \"There is no reason they are what they are \u2014 they just are.\" The idea that the laws exist reasonlessly is deeply anti-rational. After all, the very essence of a scientific explanation of some phenomenon is that the world is ordered logically and that there are reasons things are as they are. If one traces these reasons all the way down to the bedrock of reality \u2014 the laws of physics \u2014 only to find that reason then deserts us, it makes a mockery of science.\" But that's exactly right - science isn't supposed to answer \"WHY.\" It answers \"what, how, when, where, and by what means.\" It's a PROCESS of rational discovery, inquiry, and formulation of conclusions - not a simple unwrapping of nice, neat nuggets of ultimate truth. You can play with philosophy and religion all you want to satisfy your need to understand why, but that's not part of science. However, as time goes on, things once relegated to the realm of myth and faith are now solidly explained by scientifically testable laws and theories. Why does the moon go through phases every month? That used to be the subject of myth and faith, and something as simple as an eclipse was enough to cause ancient people to wonder if the gods had deserted them. We now can fully explain the movements and phases of the moon by the most basic principles of physics. Given enough time, plenty of things that most people still blindly cover with \"faith\" will be explained by science. Why is the universe the way it is? Can't tell you; talk to your preacher. How does the universe work? Look to the cutting edge of physics. Why are we here? That's between you and your god of choice. How did we get here? Try taking a few biology courses.",

If stupid people use it, as they have religion, to further some sort of political agenda that places them at the center of their own contrived universe, that isn't Darwin's fault.

Therefore, to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour. When you were a student, you were not yet a scientist. However, I can speak from my own experience, even as a student, I was NEVER told to just accept scientific laws and mathematical theorems without testing them. The whole point is that ALL of science is based on evidence, and can be tested, questioned, and revised if new evidence is discovered. There is NO FAITH involved in science. You don't \"discover\" laws like uncovering some mysterious revealed truth. You observe patterns, propose and test hypothesis, formulate laws based on tests and observations, and finally create theories as the logical conclusion based on tested and reliable laws. We do not need to have faith that the universe is \"governed\" by anything. However, if you perform Test A of Substance B in Situation C, and the results are the same every single time, it is fair to CONCLUDE that a logical physical law will continue to describe the different aspects of the forces in question. quote: Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are. The answers vary from \"that's not a scientific question\" to \"nobody knows.\" The favorite reply is, \"There is no reason they are what they are \u2014 they just are.\" The idea that the laws exist reasonlessly is deeply anti-rational.

If one traces these reasons all the way down to the bedrock of reality \u2014 the laws of physics \u2014 only to find that reason then deserts us, it makes a mockery of science.\" But that's exactly right - science isn't supposed to answer \"WHY.\" It answers \"what, how, when, where, and by what means.\" It's a PROCESS of rational discovery, inquiry, and formulation of conclusions - not a simple unwrapping of nice, neat nuggets of ultimate truth. You can play with philosophy and religion all you want to satisfy your need to understand why, but that's not part of science. However, as time goes on, things once relegated to the realm of myth and faith are now solidly explained by scientifically testable laws and theories. Why does the moon go through phases every month? That used to be the subject of myth and faith, and something as simple as an eclipse was enough to cause ancient people to wonder if the gods had deserted them. We now can fully explain the movements and phases of the moon by the most basic principles of physics. Given enough time, plenty of things that most people still blindly cover with \"faith\" will be explained by science. Why is the universe the way it is? Can't tell you; talk to your preacher.

        "quote": "Originally posted by adminnco1: When I was a student, the laws of physics were regarded as completely off limits. The job of the scientist, we were told, is to discover the laws and apply them, not inquire into their provenance. The laws were treated as \"given\" \u2014 imprinted on the universe like a maker's mark at the moment of cosmic birth \u2014 and fixed forevermore. Therefore, to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour.", 
        "reply": " When you were a student, you were not yet a scientist. However, I can speak from my own experience, even as a student, I was NEVER told to just accept scientific laws and mathematical theorems without testing them. The whole point is that ALL of science is based on evidence, and can be tested, questioned, and revised if new evidence is discovered. There is NO FAITH involved in science. You don't \"discover\" laws like uncovering some mysterious revealed truth. You observe patterns, propose and test hypothesis, formulate laws based on tests and observations, and finally create theories as the logical conclusion based on tested and reliable laws. We do not need to have faith that the universe is \"governed\" by anything. However, if you perform Test A of Substance B in Situation C, and the results are the same every single time, it is fair to CONCLUDE that a logical physical law will continue to describe the different aspects of the forces in question. quote: Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are. The answers vary from \"that's not a scientific question\" to \"nobody knows.\" The favorite reply is, \"There is no reason they are what they are \u2014 they just are.\" The idea that the laws exist reasonlessly is deeply anti-rational. After all, the very essence of a scientific explanation of some phenomenon is that the world is ordered logically and that there are reasons things are as they are. If one traces these reasons all the way down to the bedrock of reality \u2014 the laws of physics \u2014 only to find that reason then deserts us, it makes a mockery of science.\" But that's exactly right - science isn't supposed to answer \"WHY.\" It answers \"what, how, when, where, and by what means.\" It's a PROCESS of rational discovery, inquiry, and formulation of conclusions - not a simple unwrapping of nice, neat nuggets of ultimate truth. You can play with philosophy and religion all you want to satisfy your need to understand why, but that's not part of science. However, as time goes on, things once relegated to the realm of myth and faith are now solidly explained by scientifically testable laws and theories. Why does the moon go through phases every month? That used to be the subject of myth and faith, and something as simple as an eclipse was enough to cause ancient people to wonder if the gods had deserted them. We now can fully explain the movements and phases of the moon by the most basic principles of physics. Given enough time, plenty of things that most people still blindly cover with \"faith\" will be explained by science. Why is the universe the way it is? Can't tell you; talk to your preacher. How does the universe work? Look to the cutting edge of physics. Why are we here? That's between you and your god of choice. How did we get here? Try taking a few biology courses.",

When you were a student, you were not yet a scientist. However, I can speak from my own experience, even as a student, I was NEVER told to just accept scientific laws and mathematical theorems without testing them. The whole point is that ALL of science is based on evidence, and can be tested, questioned, and revised if new evidence is discovered. There is NO FAITH involved in science. You don't \"discover\" laws like uncovering some mysterious revealed truth. You observe patterns, propose and test hypothesis, formulate laws based on tests and observations, and finally create theories as the logical conclusion based on tested and reliable laws. We do not need to have faith that the universe is \"governed\" by anything.

You can play with philosophy and religion all you want to satisfy your need to understand why, but that's not part of science. However, as time goes on, things once relegated to the realm of myth and faith are now solidly explained by scientifically testable laws and theories. Why does the moon go through phases every month?

So in the end 'scientific proof' amounts to little more than a series of elegant mathematical statements based on presuppositions that are, in reality, quite arbitrary in their origin. As the previous referenced article concludes: \"It seems to me there is no hope of ever explaining why the physical universe is as it is so long as we are fixated on immutable laws or meta-laws that exist reasonlessly or are imposed by divine providence. The alternative is to regard the laws of physics and the universe they govern as part and parcel of a unitary system, and to be incorporated together within a common explanatory scheme. In other words, the laws should have an explanation from within the universe and not involve appealing to an external agency. The specifics of that explanation are a matter for future research. But until science comes up with a testable theory of the laws of the universe, its claim to be free of faith is manifestly bogus.\"",

Given enough time, plenty of things that most people still blindly cover with \"faith\" will be explained by science. Why is the universe the way it is? Can't tell you; talk to your preacher. How does the universe work? Look to the cutting edge of physics. Why are we here? That's between you and your god of choice. How did we get here? Try taking a few biology courses.", 
        "reply": " So in the end 'scientific proof' amounts to little more than a series of elegant mathematical statements based on presuppositions that are, in reality, quite arbitrary in their origin. As the previous referenced article concludes: \"It seems to me there is no hope of ever explaining why the physical universe is as it is so long as we are fixated on immutable laws or meta-laws that exist reasonlessly or are imposed by divine providence. The alternative is to regard the laws of physics and the universe they govern as part and parcel of a unitary system, and to be incorporated together within a common explanatory scheme. In other words, the laws should have an explanation from within the universe and not involve appealing to an external agency. The specifics of that explanation are a matter for future research. But until science comes up with a testable theory of the laws of the universe, its claim to be free of faith is manifestly bogus.\"",

However, this may add to your reading enjoyment (of this subject): \"http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/01/victory-over-weaknesses-texas-004236\" I'll have to go back and read it again later with an open mind, because the article already gave me a negative \"view\" when they stated: The winning side.... \"And the momentousness of the vote was not lost on NCSE's executive director Eugenie C. Scott, who explained in a January 23, 2009, press release: \"The misleading language [in the original science standards] has been a creationist loophole in the science TEKS [Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills] for decades.\" Note: The \"TEKS\" as such has not been around for decade\"s\". Very upsetting to the winning side, was what the creationist side put in. See the following: \"The worst change was to a requirement that students \"evaluate a variety of fossil types, transitional fossils, fossil lineages, and significant fossil deposits with regard to their appearance, completeness, and rate and diversity of evolution,\" which now reads, \"evaluate a variety of fossil types, proposed transitional fossils, fossil lineages, and significant fossil deposits and assess the arguments for and against universal common descent in light of this fossil evidence. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",

The laws were treated as \"given\" \u2014 imprinted on the universe like a maker's mark at the moment of cosmic birth \u2014 and fixed forevermore. Therefore, to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. You've got to believe that these laws won't fail, that we won't wake up tomorrow to find heat flowing from cold to hot, or the speed of light changing by the hour. When you were a student, you were not yet a scientist. However, I can speak from my own experience, even as a student, I was NEVER told to just accept scientific laws and mathematical theorems without testing them. The whole point is that ALL of science is based on evidence, and can be tested, questioned, and revised if new evidence is discovered. There is NO FAITH involved in science. You don't \"discover\" laws like uncovering some mysterious revealed truth. You observe patterns, propose and test hypothesis, formulate laws based on tests and observations, and finally create theories as the logical conclusion based on tested and reliable laws. We do not need to have faith that the universe is \"governed\" by anything. However, if you perform Test A of Substance B in Situation C, and the results are the same every single time, it is fair to CONCLUDE that a logical physical law will continue to describe the different aspects of the forces in question. quote: Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are. The answers vary from \"that's not a scientific question\" to \"nobody knows.\" The favorite reply is, \"There is no reason they are what they are \u2014 they just are.\" The idea that the laws exist reasonlessly is deeply anti-rational. After all, the very essence of a scientific explanation of some phenomenon is that the world is ordered logically and that there are reasons things are as they are. If one traces these reasons all the way down to the bedrock of reality \u2014 the laws of physics \u2014 only to find that reason then deserts us, it makes a mockery of science.\" But that's exactly right - science isn't supposed to answer \"WHY.\" It answers \"what, how, when, where, and by what means.\" It's a PROCESS of rational discovery, inquiry, and formulation of conclusions - not a simple unwrapping of nice, neat nuggets of ultimate truth. You can play with philosophy and religion all you want to satisfy your need to understand why, but that's not part of science. However, as time goes on, things once relegated to the realm of myth and faith are now solidly explained by scientifically testable laws and theories. Why does the moon go through phases every month? That used to be the subject of myth and faith, and something as simple as an eclipse was enough to cause ancient people to wonder if the gods had deserted them. We now can fully explain the movements and phases of the moon by the most basic principles of physics. Given enough time, plenty of things that most people still blindly cover with \"faith\" will be explained by science. Why is the universe the way it is? Can't tell you; talk to your preacher. How does the universe work? Look to the cutting edge of physics. Why are we here? That's between you and your god of choice. How did we get here? Try taking a few biology courses.",

Those proponents want to say that this is \"science\", but offer none to explain it. Not very intelligent, I'd say. It's nothing more than someone's halfassed attempt at re-packaging Creationism. We settled that issue decades ago. Why are we fooling around with this again? We're wasting time...",

That's science. All that other stuff is totally irrelevant to Darwin's theories of evolution. If stupid people use it, as they have religion, to further some sort of political agenda that places them at the center of their own contrived universe, that isn't Darwin's fault.
