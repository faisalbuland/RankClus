Why not do a poll of what active duty, reserve, and guard members think of gays in the military. I've served with gays (males & females) in the military for 21 years. Some served honorably, but others didn't just like heterosexuals. The problems started when it became known that someone was gay and was wearing it on their sleeve. Most heterosexuals are afraid of being blamed for sexual harrassment or sexual discrimination, but to throw in the homosexual into the equation creates new dynamics to the equation. Are we going to grant same-sex dependent status to gay couples now? Just a question for the taxpayers. How many would really be gay or just want to hang out with their friends for join-spouse assignments? I have worked with and respected some of the gays and heterosexuals and despised others of both sexual nature, but let's ask the troops what they want, not what some Columbia law professor or a General who never had to live the E-1 to E-4 life. Are we going to force military religious institutions to accept gays as their leaders next. I would be interested in what the Catholic or Islamic chaplains have to say about that... I'm retired, so it's up to PBO to take a step or stay the status quo.",
