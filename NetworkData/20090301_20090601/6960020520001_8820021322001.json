Can inflation and unemployment be a cause from/for war, of course. It was one of the major drivers for starting WWII in my eyes. Germany had to pay off all of its war debt for the entire WWI war; it was broke and had extremely high unemployment. Which lead to turmoil and new radical populist movements, so they eventually started up their war machine to push the economy forward. Everyone knows the outcome on that. It was actually WWII that helped pull the US out of the Great Depression, not all of spending done on public infrastructure. That actually helped lengthen the down turn by about 7 years. But we are talking about today\u2019s current war and economic crisis. But we can take a lesson from it. Inflation today... well currently it\u2019s actually deflation going on. Money velocity is in the dirt, money flows into the banks but it does flow back out. (Google Japanese Zombie Economy, another great lesson, a peak into the future for what the US has in store) Inflation from the war?...nope. We have industries created just for our war machine, which helps isolate the rest of the US economy from a war economy. Commodities.. To a point, price driven up from the wars, I can accept an argument that some premium was from Middle East conflicts. But the majority was from a lack of supply that demand was out stripping. Not from the building of tanks, ships, planes, & ammo. It was the boom going on over in East Asia. But the huge commodity run was just a symptom, typical commodity rally at the end of a cycle of an overheated global economy. The main driver for the recession now was the loss of faith in the financial system. Sub-prime rules(which were federally mandated to lower the lending rules in the Clinton years, it\u2019s not all Bush\u2019s fault) and extremely complicated derivates market which has very little in accounting rules on how to value it, or how to regulate it. AKA how do you price a bond which has no market would it be a $1000 or $100 for a bond that no one wants to be in. Even if the sub-prime or prime mortgage loans used in it were completely fine. How do you price a billion dollar derivative that is a contract between two companies that is not due to expire for say another 15 years. There is so many other things going on, but this was at the heart of it. Government, Corporations, and the individual are all to blame for the position that we are in. What do we have to look forward to? This is interesting, obviously I do not have a crystal ball, but this is what I see. Take a history lesson from the Great Depression, 1970s commodities and inflation market, and 1990s-today Japanese Zombie Economy. Plus the baby boom generation is going from a spending to saving generations is going to have a huge impact on the US market. Mix in knee jerk reactionary congress, and a pro union/ tax to control human consumption populist government. What do we have in store??? Who knows? Obviously hyper inflation do to the drop in value from the dollar in the commodity market, this will help stall the economy. Banks and car manufactures that will suck the life blood out of the economy (aka Zombie Economy) so they will stay afloat. (I will never buy another GM product again, but I will pay for GM with my tax dollars awesome..) Also a tax increase in the middle of a recession can never be good, with out-of-this-world stupid spending going on with the government. What I see is basically an inverted square root sign as the pattern for the recovery of this market. Looking further out say twenty plus years of extremely slow growth.",
