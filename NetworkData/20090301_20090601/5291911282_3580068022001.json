Back in my day (and it's amusing to say this since that was only 2003) we weren't allowed anything but an alarm clock radio the first month, and no cellphones during duty hours for a bit longer. It's different now! I would suggest you wait to hear from your son via e-mail or phone. Ask him what he's allowed and if he wants you to send any of his stuff. A lot of times you can go ahead and send it, and they can store it until he's allowed those privileges. But ask first! Every command has different rules.",
