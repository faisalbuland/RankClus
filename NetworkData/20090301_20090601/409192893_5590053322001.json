Blanche Lincoln\u2019s re-election bid said Thursday he regrets referring to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as \u201cthat Jew\u201d at a Pulaski County GOP meeting last week. \u201cI don\u2019t speak with a TelePrompTer, and if I had, that reference would have never made it in there,\u201d Sen. Kim Hendren, R-Gravette, said in an interview with the Arkansas News Bureau. \u201cI know I referred to him as Jew or Jewish, and I should not have done that. I got my foot in my mouth.\u201d The statement was first reported by Jason Tolbert on his conservative political blog, The Tolbert Report, after Hendren admitted to Tolbert he made the remark during his appearance at the GOP gathering. Hendren said Thursday he made the remark in referring to comments Schumer made on the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC, in which the New York senator said that \u201cAmerican traditional values\u201d were behind them, a point Hendren said he strongly disputes. \u201cI was simply making a point about those two points. I believe in those traditional values like Andy Griffith, Aunt Bea, Barney and Opie. But now all that was lost with this statement,\u201d Hendren said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any issue with Jews or Jewish people or whatever the politically correct term they wish to be identified as,\u201d he said. Wasn't it the Right-wing who, all too recently, claiming that the President wasn't a good public speaker - because he used a teleprompter? Seems the Right shouldn't attack the President for teleprompter use - they should use them more often themselves. Some would find it easier to hide their anti-semitism if they didn't try to speak without notes...",
