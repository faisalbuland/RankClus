They want to upgrade their tanker fleet (along with other large aircraft I am sure). Why not let the USA do or absorb all the costly Developmental Test and Evaluation work followed by the Operational Test and Evaluation work while they just sit back and reap the fruits of our knowledge. If you notice on the F-35 Program, each of the foreign countries that are interested in this aircraft were required to fess up part of the development and testing costs ahead of time. This is yet another reason to buy American and EADS/Airbus is NOT American made. France is not and can not be trusted\u2026ever when it comes to the safety and wellbeing of the USA.",

The four national entities which had previously formed the Airbus consortium transferred their Airbus-related assets to the new company and became shareholders in Airbus -- Airbus France, Airbus Deutschland and Airbus Espana merging as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) with 80% shares and BAE Systems with 20%. In 2006, following the sales of BAE Systems' shares, Airbus became an EADS company. Yes, Airbus is now part of EADS, however, it is governed by French Law which commands the politics if this issue. In short, if France does not like what the USA is doing in the World for whatever reason, they can cut the USAF off and have done so in the past. This type of issue or condition is not in the best interest of the USAF nor the USA. Their product will ONLY be assembled in the USA, most all parts will be made outside the USA and out of our control yet under the control of France/EADS/Airbus. This includes spares. Yes, Boeing also had parts of their product made outside the USA but final assemble is states-side.
