It does not appear that the revelation will damage Kirk\u2019s nomination, which is scheduled to be the subject of a Monday hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. Committee chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) issued a statement expressing support for Kirk, calling him \u201cthe right person for this job and I will work to move his nomination quickly.\u201d A former Dallas mayor who has been working as a lawyer and lobbyist, Kirk is the fourth administration appointee to be called out for tax problems. In a report, the Senate Finance Committee noted that Kirk failed to report $37,750 in honoraria as income from 2004 through 2007, because he donated the speaking fees irectly to Austin College in Sherman, Texas, his alma mater, to create a scholarship fund. The committee said he also inflated the fair market value of a TV he donated to charity in 2006, and could not account for $7,500 worth of Dallas Mavericks basketball tickets he counted as a business expense. The total adjustments on his 2005, 2006 and 2007 returns will be $9,975. Baucus and the finance committee\u2019s ranking Republican, Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), issued a joint statement along with the report explaining \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Finance Committee to conduct a thorough vetting of all nominees whose confirmations fall under our jurisdiction. The committee produced this report and conducted a briefing for the staff of committee members today to ensure the appropriate level of transparency and to ensure Senators are fully informed and are able to assess the relevant information before the panel considers Mr. Kirk\u2019s nomination next Monday.\u201d More at: 'http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19514.html'",

Charlie Rangel (D-Harlem), and new Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Chairman Rangel admitted on the floor of the House that he had for years failed to pay tax on rental income from his resort property in the Caribbean. He apologized for this \"oversight\" and agreed to pay his back taxes - but has paid no interest or penalties. Secretary Geithner admitted in his Senate confirmation hearings he had for years failed to pay taxes on his income from the International Monetary Fund, even though the IMF sent him checks and instructions to pay those taxes. He also called this an \"oversight,\" has paid no penalties and faces no charges. As a former practicing attorney and a Texas state judge for two decades, I can tell you: If that was you or me, we'd be socked with penalties and interest many times the amount of the original tax. In a case like Geithner's, I suspect we'd likely face criminal charges as well. But Rep. Rangel is the powerful Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS. And Geithner is secretary of the treasury - the boss of the IRS. Just like Bill Hobby, these two high-status fellows have received a little different treatment than the common taxpayer. We either need to hold Chairman Rangel and Secretary Geithner fully accountable under the law - or we need a national \"Hobby Rule\" for taxpayers. Last week, I introduced the Rangel Rule Act of 2009 (HR 735). Under this bill, any US citizen who owes back taxes can pay them and automatically waive all interest and penalties by writing \"Rangel Rule\" on their return. I believe this would restore equal treatment for working Americans - and serve as an economic stimulus by restoring millions in pending IRS penalties and interests to the free-market economy.",

Charlie Rangel (D-Harlem), and new Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Chairman Rangel admitted on the floor of the House that he had for years failed to pay tax on rental income from his resort property in the Caribbean. He apologized for this \"oversight\" and agreed to pay his back taxes - but has paid no interest or penalties. Secretary Geithner admitted in his Senate confirmation hearings he had for years failed to pay taxes on his income from the International Monetary Fund, even though the IMF sent him checks and instructions to pay those taxes. He also called this an \"oversight,\" has paid no penalties and faces no charges. As a former practicing attorney and a Texas state judge for two decades, I can tell you: If that was you or me, we'd be socked with penalties and interest many times the amount of the original tax. In a case like Geithner's, I suspect we'd likely face criminal charges as well. But Rep. Rangel is the powerful Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS. And Geithner is secretary of the treasury - the boss of the IRS. Just like Bill Hobby, these two high-status fellows have received a little different treatment than the common taxpayer. We either need to hold Chairman Rangel and Secretary Geithner fully accountable under the law - or we need a national \"Hobby Rule\" for taxpayers. Last week, I introduced the Rangel Rule Act of 2009 (HR 735). Under this bill, any US citizen who owes back taxes can pay them and automatically waive all interest and penalties by writing \"Rangel Rule\" on their return. I believe this would restore equal treatment for working Americans - and serve as an economic stimulus by restoring millions in pending IRS penalties and interests to the free-market economy.",

Charlie Rangel (D-Harlem), and new Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Chairman Rangel admitted on the floor of the House that he had for years failed to pay tax on rental income from his resort property in the Caribbean. He apologized for this \"oversight\" and agreed to pay his back taxes - but has paid no interest or penalties. Secretary Geithner admitted in his Senate confirmation hearings he had for years failed to pay taxes on his income from the International Monetary Fund, even though the IMF sent him checks and instructions to pay those taxes. He also called this an \"oversight,\" has paid no penalties and faces no charges. As a former practicing attorney and a Texas state judge for two decades, I can tell you: If that was you or me, we'd be socked with penalties and interest many times the amount of the original tax. In a case like Geithner's, I suspect we'd likely face criminal charges as well. But Rep. Rangel is the powerful Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS. And Geithner is secretary of the treasury - the boss of the IRS. Just like Bill Hobby, these two high-status fellows have received a little different treatment than the common taxpayer. We either need to hold Chairman Rangel and Secretary Geithner fully accountable under the law - or we need a national \"Hobby Rule\" for taxpayers. Last week, I introduced the Rangel Rule Act of 2009 (HR 735). Under this bill, any US citizen who owes back taxes can pay them and automatically waive all interest and penalties by writing \"Rangel Rule\" on their return. I believe this would restore equal treatment for working Americans - and serve as an economic stimulus by restoring millions in pending IRS penalties and interests to the free-market economy.",

We either need to hold Chairman Rangel and Secretary Geithner fully accountable under the law - or we need a national \"Hobby Rule\" for taxpayers. Last week, I introduced the Rangel Rule Act of 2009 (HR 735). Under this bill, any US citizen who owes back taxes can pay them and automatically waive all interest and penalties by writing \"Rangel Rule\" on their return. I believe this would restore equal treatment for working Americans - and serve as an economic stimulus by restoring millions in pending IRS penalties and interests to the free-market economy.",
