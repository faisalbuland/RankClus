Would the American public have turned on the war effort as hard as it did?? In short, yes. There was a memo put out by the progressive caucus shortly after 9/11, that was closely mirrored by a piece on the CPUSA website that detailed how they must not let the \"right\" harness the righteous unifying anger of the American people. Hours after 9/11, the opposition recognized it must wage it's own war against the party in power, and begin chipping away at athe war effort. Before mental midget Americans began offering themselves to protect Saddam's genocidal regime, idiot Americans were protesting military action in Afghanistan. It was bound to be. From the begginning the left realized they could not allow the perception that a just war was being waged.",

        "reply": "The pictures of the Mirage 'crop dusters' were on ALL the news channels! but everything is 'insignificant' to those who have closed minds. (i.e. the 'Cold War' wasn't real because the USSR wouldn't really use nuclear weapons; they were only to deter the United States from using theirs!) Those 'insignificant' WMD's and ingredients were enough to wipe out Iran, Syria, and Israel with not only deaths but enough collateral damage to give Sadaam the 'Persian Throne', he desired. We should also have waited, according to today's ROE to see what Japan's real intentions were as 'Pearl Harbor' was a remote Naval Base on a territory with little significance to the mainland USA and Hitler's European/African wars meant nothing to the security of the United States at the time. The Germans posed no threat to the US.",

LOL, in other words, you didn't address my point, but rather fell back on the whole \"left vs. right\" argument which was innacurate in my case since I don't see the truth as having a political party.",
