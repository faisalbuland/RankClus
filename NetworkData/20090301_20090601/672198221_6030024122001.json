        "content": "The Secretary of Defense made a statement that he believes the concept of employment of the EFV that supports its acquisition may need review. As numerous former Marine Amtrackers have atested here along with a combat vet about the necessity for both the MV-22 and an EFV combined capability set (MV-22 now combat proven dispite it's less then graceful entry into the Corps), the capacity to conduct an assault from the sea appears to remain relevent. The Marine Corps has never been afraid of self-speculation. Unfortunately, when programs like the MV-22 and the EFV get into trouble pundits like Mr. Polmar find them easy prey. It is important for the general audience to understand that Mr. Polmar's background is NAVY not NAVAL. He is no friend of the Corps and his ascerbation of SECDEF's comments for the sake of sensationalism should be carefully considered. The Marine Corps responsibility to conduct forcible entry via amphibious assualt is written into US code in Title 10. It is law. SECDEF and Mr. Polmar can both generate arguements to change that law. Until then, the Commandant of the Marine Corps is obliged to do his duty. The program, in all its turbulence will indeed make a script for \"Pentagon Wars II\" - the path here to date is littered with mistakes and setbacks. Regardless of past hiccups and past proven incompentency by both General Dynamics and the Marine Program EFV office, the program is now stable, technical hurdles have been overcome, the Air Force is now writing the software for the vehicle and given appropriate time and some patience, the EFV will meet it's intended purpose. Mr. Polmar selectively quotes operational parameters of a 21st Century amphibious assault from various sources, including articles pulbished in Proceddings and other NAVY focused tabloids. Most of the anti-amphibious articles are written by Navy officers in these tabloids have never been on an amphibious ship nor participated in any landward activity that is a proud component of the Marine Corps NAVAL heritage. Investigate that claim carefully... If someone wants some facts to investgate they can find out how many of the vehicles Mr. Polmar would recommend replace the EFV could be moved ashore in an operationally relevent timeline from 25 NM offshore? (e.g., required minimum distance (not 50 NM (air craft carrier proposed location - See USMC STOM). 25 nm provides Amphibiouis shipping from known direct fire anti-ship weapon systems). The method to get Mr. Palmor's vehicle of choice would be LCAC unless you create a new program of record. Minimum size that meets Title 10 requirements is a Marine Amphibious Brigade, which means at least two mechanized Marine Battalions. With the EFV, 2/3rd's of your infantry force is \"self deployable\". Say we use a Bradley or any other Infantry Fighting Vehicle (Striker? - same problems of vulnerability given int the article...). Multiply requird LCAC spots by number of availble amphibs in the current Navy Amphibious Fleet (e.g., 120 vehicles - assuming they carry 17 personnel each)... When you determine the deficit, find out how many more LCAC's you need and the ships to carry them so that you remain operationally relevant? Of course we could land Marines via RO/RO ships at a port assuming we can find one that is located within an operationally relevent RANGE of the objective area. In fact, we can do that now, it's called MPF. So if we don't need EFV maybe we cut the Amphib fleet as well? So many successful missions in the last 20 years - non of them were \"forcible\" though so maybe they don't fit the argument? The last four Commandants and the last four generals responsible for Marine Corps Plans, Policy's and Operations supported the EFV. Not because it is an ideal or \"does it all\" solution to a unique Marien Corps need; because it made sense when you do NAVAL math. Mr. Polmar called this NAVAL math \"gobbledy****\".

        "reply": "The Secretary of Defense made a statement that he believes the concept of employment of the EFV that supports its acquisition may need review. As numerous former Marine Amtrackers have atested here along with a combat vet about the necessity for both the MV-22 and an EFV combined capability set (MV-22 now combat proven dispite it's less then graceful entry into the Corps), the capacity to conduct an assault from the sea appears to remain relevent. The Marine Corps has never been afraid of self-speculation. Unfortunately, when programs like the MV-22 and the EFV get into trouble pundits like Mr. Polmar find them easy prey. It is important for the general audience to understand that Mr. Polmar's background is NAVY not NAVAL. He is no friend of the Corps and his ascerbation of SECDEF's comments for the sake of sensationalism should be carefully considered. The Marine Corps responsibility to conduct forcible entry via amphibious assualt is written into US code in Title 10. It is law. SECDEF and Mr. Polmar can both generate arguements to change that law. Until then, the Commandant of the Marine Corps is obliged to do his duty. The program, in all its turbulence will indeed make a script for \"Pentagon Wars II\" - the path here to date is littered with mistakes and setbacks. Regardless of past hiccups and past proven incompentency by both General Dynamics and the Marine Program EFV office, the program is now stable, technical hurdles have been overcome, the Air Force is now writing the software for the vehicle and given appropriate time and some patience, the EFV will meet it's intended purpose. Mr. Polmar selectively quotes operational parameters of a 21st Century amphibious assault from various sources, including articles pulbished in Proceddings and other NAVY focused tabloids. Most of the anti-amphibious articles are written by Navy officers in these tabloids have never been on an amphibious ship nor participated in any landward activity that is a proud component of the Marine Corps NAVAL heritage. Investigate that claim carefully... If someone wants some facts to investgate they can find out how many of the vehicles Mr. Polmar would recommend replace the EFV could be moved ashore in an operationally relevent timeline from 25 NM offshore? (e.g., required minimum distance (not 50 NM (air craft carrier proposed location - See USMC STOM). 25 nm provides Amphibiouis shipping from known direct fire anti-ship weapon systems). The method to get Mr. Palmor's vehicle of choice would be LCAC unless you create a new program of record. Minimum size that meets Title 10 requirements is a Marine Amphibious Brigade, which means at least two mechanized Marine Battalions. With the EFV, 2/3rd's of your infantry force is \"self deployable\". Say we use a Bradley or any other Infantry Fighting Vehicle (Striker? - same problems of vulnerability given int the article...). Multiply requird LCAC spots by number of availble amphibs in the current Navy Amphibious Fleet (e.g., 120 vehicles - assuming they carry 17 personnel each)... When you determine the deficit, find out how many more LCAC's you need and the ships to carry them so that you remain operationally relevant? Of course we could land Marines via RO/RO ships at a port assuming we can find one that is located within an operationally relevent RANGE of the objective area. In fact, we can do that now, it's called MPF. So if we don't need EFV maybe we cut the Amphib fleet as well? So many successful missions in the last 20 years - non of them were \"forcible\" though so maybe they don't fit the argument? The last four Commandants and the last four generals responsible for Marine Corps Plans, Policy's and Operations supported the EFV. Not because it is an ideal or \"does it all\" solution to a unique Marien Corps need; because it made sense when you do NAVAL math. Mr. Polmar called this NAVAL math \"gobbledy****\". I suspect if a consultant to CMC or PP&O empoloyed that venacular to describe decades of Navy, Marine or Naval analysis their stay would be short lived. Objectivity, even in the face of programmatic incompentency, is necessary for all concerned. It has not been a straight nor efficient path to this point.

Kenneth Ellman Damn. Very well said! I hope you squids and jarheads don't mind this intrusion by a dumb-azz grunt (Army Infantry), but I feel the need to comment. The limitations of equipment are the core concept of that equipment's worth. I was 11 Mike, Mechanized Infantry, so I was part light fighter and part cargo. The Bradley was nice for getting us there, but one shot against it could take out my entire squad. I always preferred being boots on the ground rather than at the whims of the tin can. Where so many fought tooth and nail to earn a driver/gunner position, I fought tooth and nail to stay dismounted - it was SOP in my day (1989 - 1993) that anyone above E3 was mounted or should be, and that only those that couldn't cut it stayed dismount. But, then again, I never wanted mechanized, stupid 11X contract. However, there were operations that identified the Bradley's mission to the nth degree; namely the push to Baghdad. Now that we're in transition to the Strykers, I'm seeing a balance in the pendulum swing between the 113 and the Bradley - we're finding a solid middle ground between speed and survivability. I regret having left the Army before I got a chance to serve on a Stryker, just because I would have appreciated the experience as a squad leader as I was when I ETS'd. Anyway, all that to say that I agree that the mobile mission that is ocean/ground needs revision. Your tools are a bit outdated. Amphibious assaults work - it forces the opponent to defend both their sea and their beach egress, to stretch out their manpower, and to formulate guesses as to where a landing can occur. The Osprey does suffer some limitations, but \"hot roping/ fast roping\" can't be an issue given that the prop wash is only marginally different than that of the '53 -- or even the '60, for that matter -- on one side of the aircraft for a hot zone rope deployment. My first repel from a Blackhawk, I thought my scrawny butt was going to be blown off like a leaf in a hurricane. But fast roping is still the preferred method of insertion when the LZ is hot. As my Plt Sgt used to say, \"You're safe if you don't let go, given that someone down there doesn't put a bullet in you\" lol! There was a point to this. Y'all Marines serve a very unique mission, so you need very unique tools. I agree that R&D cannot be stymied by any garbage. Here's my question: If the EFV is to really be the end-all of the dual concept between sea and land, why are they sacrificing speed to weight ratios? I admit that I am just a dumb grunt, but it occurs to me that protection always has to be the forefront of operation, as the trigger pullers fight the real battles. As the Army went to the Stryker for more mobility, should the Marines not be concentrating on more protection? I realize that speed is important. But when you're hitting the beach, you have the entire US Navy backing you up. So why is speed more important than survivability? The Navy can protect you from just about any sea force on the planet as you disembark the ships, but they are not going to be your protectors once you're boots on the ground. Am I just being naive? Am I thinking too Infantry and missing something? It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
