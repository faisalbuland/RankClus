Now we'll find out what the \"Party of NO\" has in store for her. lol So if the Republicans oppose her in any way that just maes them more \"Party of No\"? Like the democrats have never obstructed a thing. Not anything like Republican's have. Democrats are allowed to think for themselves, unlike their counterparts. Why you think it's the Party of \"NO.\"",
