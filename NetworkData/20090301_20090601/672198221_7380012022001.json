The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. A semiautomatic shotgun with: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a pistol grip (see definition below), (iii) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, and (iv) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Frames or receivers for the above are included, along with conversion kits. Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will: Under the proposal, the U.S. Attorney General can add any \u201csemiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General.Note that Obama\u2019s pick for this office, Eric Holder, wrote a brief in the Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home. In making this determination, the bill says, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, and a shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event.\u201d In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public. The last part is particularly clever, stating that a firearm doesn\u2019t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose \u2014 is that devious or what? And of course, \u201csporting purpose\u201d is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever, invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent.

Good luck getting anyone to enforce going door to door to collect firearms. And I don't honestly see anyone volunteering to turn them over either. And all these gun bans are supposed to make the world a safer place for who? On another note I wish I could find the link again but haven\u2019t been able to since. However, a few weeks ago I was reading an article talking about how America needs to disarm and stop having a \"love affair\" with guns like most of the EUR countries have done. The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. A semiautomatic shotgun with: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a pistol grip (see definition below), (iii) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, and (iv) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Frames or receivers for the above are included, along with conversion kits. Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will: Under the proposal, the U.S. Attorney General can add any \u201csemiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General.Note that Obama\u2019s pick for this office, Eric Holder, wrote a brief in the Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home. In making this determination, the bill says, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, and a shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event.\u201d In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public. The last part is particularly clever, stating that a firearm doesn\u2019t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose \u2014 is that devious or what? And of course, \u201csporting purpose\u201d is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever, invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent.

And all these gun bans are supposed to make the world a safer place for who? On another note I wish I could find the link again but haven\u2019t been able to since. However, a few weeks ago I was reading an article talking about how America needs to disarm and stop having a \"love affair\" with guns like most of the EUR countries have done. The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. A semiautomatic shotgun with: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a pistol grip (see definition below), (iii) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, and (iv) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Frames or receivers for the above are included, along with conversion kits. Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will: Under the proposal, the U.S. Attorney General can add any \u201csemiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General.Note that Obama\u2019s pick for this office, Eric Holder, wrote a brief in the Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home. In making this determination, the bill says, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, and a shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event.\u201d In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public. The last part is particularly clever, stating that a firearm doesn\u2019t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose \u2014 is that devious or what? And of course, \u201csporting purpose\u201d is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever, invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent.

Why again did anyone vote for this guy Oh that\u2019s right because they were to stupid to see what happens in the real world. Good luck getting anyone to enforce going door to door to collect firearms. And I don't honestly see anyone volunteering to turn them over either. And all these gun bans are supposed to make the world a safer place for who? On another note I wish I could find the link again but haven\u2019t been able to since. However, a few weeks ago I was reading an article talking about how America needs to disarm and stop having a \"love affair\" with guns like most of the EUR countries have done. The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment.

Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles).

In making this determination, the bill says, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, and a shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event.\u201d In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public. The last part is particularly clever, stating that a firearm doesn\u2019t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose \u2014 is that devious or what? And of course, \u201csporting purpose\u201d is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever, invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical.

Good luck getting anyone to enforce going door to door to collect firearms. And I don't honestly see anyone volunteering to turn them over either. And all these gun bans are supposed to make the world a safer place for who? On another note I wish I could find the link again but haven\u2019t been able to since. However, a few weeks ago I was reading an article talking about how America needs to disarm and stop having a \"love affair\" with guns like most of the EUR countries have done. The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. A semiautomatic shotgun with: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a pistol grip (see definition below), (iii) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, and (iv) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Frames or receivers for the above are included, along with conversion kits. Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will: Under the proposal, the U.S. Attorney General can add any \u201csemiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General.Note that Obama\u2019s pick for this office, Eric Holder, wrote a brief in the Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home. In making this determination, the bill says, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, and a shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event.\u201d In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public. The last part is particularly clever, stating that a firearm doesn\u2019t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose \u2014 is that devious or what? And of course, \u201csporting purpose\u201d is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever, invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent.

However, a few weeks ago I was reading an article talking about how America needs to disarm and stop having a \"love affair\" with guns like most of the EUR countries have done. The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. A semiautomatic shotgun with: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a pistol grip (see definition below), (iii) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, and (iv) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Frames or receivers for the above are included, along with conversion kits. Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will: Under the proposal, the U.S. Attorney General can add any \u201csemiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General.Note that Obama\u2019s pick for this office, Eric Holder, wrote a brief in the Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home. In making this determination, the bill says, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, and a shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event.\u201d In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public. The last part is particularly clever, stating that a firearm doesn\u2019t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose \u2014 is that devious or what? And of course, \u201csporting purpose\u201d is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever, invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent.

Why again did anyone vote for this guy Oh that\u2019s right because they were to stupid to see what happens in the real world. Good luck getting anyone to enforce going door to door to collect firearms. And I don't honestly see anyone volunteering to turn them over either. And all these gun bans are supposed to make the world a safer place for who? On another note I wish I could find the link again but haven\u2019t been able to since. However, a few weeks ago I was reading an article talking about how America needs to disarm and stop having a \"love affair\" with guns like most of the EUR countries have done. The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds.

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. A semiautomatic shotgun with: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a pistol grip (see definition below), (iii) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, and (iv) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Frames or receivers for the above are included, along with conversion kits.

Good luck getting anyone to enforce going door to door to collect firearms. And I don't honestly see anyone volunteering to turn them over either. And all these gun bans are supposed to make the world a safer place for who? On another note I wish I could find the link again but haven\u2019t been able to since. However, a few weeks ago I was reading an article talking about how America needs to disarm and stop having a \"love affair\" with guns like most of the EUR countries have done. The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.

Seriously here is a link http://www.wusa9.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=83894&provider=top There are tons more out there especially since this police department hasn't had an officer killed in years. The officers were responding to a domestic dispute call and the psyco gunned them down. He may have stated that he was worried about his constitutional rights and stockpiled guns because he didn't agree with the president but that does not give someone the \"right\" to gun down law enforcement officers for showing up because their mother is the one who called them because she was afraid of you. At the point in which you decide to fire upon a law enforcement officer because you can't do what your mommy tells you to do then uh yeah you should have your guns taken away. Law abiding citizens should be allowed to have them. American citizens should be allowed to have them. However once you cross the line to criminal you lose your rights as an American. or at least some of them which is why felons are not allowed to own guns! If they were just showing up to take his gun collection then that is one thing. he was just giving them the bullets first. But this isn't the case and he should be tried to the extent of the law. THEN SHOT! or save the tax payers the time and money and just shoot him anyway.",

The framework for legislation is always laid, and the Democrats have the votes to pass anything they want to impose upon us. They really do not believe you need anything more than a brick to defend your home and family. Look at the list and see how many you own. Remember, it is registration, then confiscation. It has happened in the UK, in Australia, in Europe, in China, and what they have found is that for some reason the criminals do not turn in their weapons, but will know that you did. Remember, the first step in establishing a dictatorship is to disarm the citizens. Gun-ban list proposed. Slipping below the radar (or under the short-term memory cap), the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list, even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage (HR 1022, 110th Congress). It serves as a framework for the new list the Brady\u2019s plan to introduce shortly. I have an outline of the Brady\u2019s current plans and targets of opportunity. It\u2019s horrific. They\u2019re going after the courts, regulatory agencies, firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people. They\u2019ve made little mention of criminals. Now more than ever, attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical. Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure, due process, confiscated property, states\u2019 rights, free speech, right to assemble and more, in addition to the Second Amendment. The Democrats current gun-ban-list proposal (final list will be worse): Rifles (or copies or duplicates): M1 Carbine, Sturm Ruger Mini-14, AR-15, Bushmaster XM15, Armalite M15, AR-10, Thompson 1927, Thompson M1; AK, AKM, AKS, AK-47, AK-74, ARM, MAK90, NHM 90, NHM 91, SA 85, SA 93, VEPR; Olympic Arms PCR; AR70, Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU, Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, or FNC, Hi-Point20Carbine, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, HK-PSG-1, Thompson 1927 Commando, Kel-Tec Sub Rifle; Saiga, SAR-8, SAR-4800, SKS with detachable magazine, SLG 95, SLR 95 or 96, Steyr AU, Tavor, Uzi, Galil and Uzi Sporter, Galil Sporter, or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ). Pistols (or copies or duplicates): Calico M-110, MAC-10, MAC-11, or MPA3, Olympic Arms OA, TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 Scorpion, or AB-10, Uzi. Shotguns (or copies or duplicates): Armscor 30 BG, SPAS 12 or LAW 12, Striker 12, Streetsweeper. Catch-all category (for anything missed or new designs): A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a pistol grip (which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip, see below), (iv) a forward grip; or a barrel shroud. Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds (except tubular magazine .22 rim fire rifles). A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and has: (i) a second pistol grip, (ii) a threaded barrel, (iii) a barrel shroud or (iv) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip, and (v) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds. A semiautomatic shotgun with: (i) a folding or telescoping stock, (ii) a pistol grip (see definition below), (iii) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, and (iv) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Frames or receivers for the above are included, along with conversion kits. Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will: Under the proposal, the U.S. Attorney General can add any \u201csemiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General.Note that Obama\u2019s pick for this office, Eric Holder, wrote a brief in the Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home. In making this determination, the bill says, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, and a shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event.\u201d In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public. The last part is particularly clever, stating that a firearm doesn\u2019t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose \u2014 is that devious or what? And of course, \u201csporting purpose\u201d is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever, invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent.

The article was written I think back in 2004. However after reading how they don't have problems in other countries since they have disarmed their public and that issues concerning guns only happen here in the US. Well the next day there was another High School shooting in Germany. Yeah glad to hear that disarming American Citizens who believe in this country will stop those things from happening. Maybe the morons in office should realize that disarming those who can and will arm themselves in protection are the only ones who are able to keep them protected from those who want to hurt them. Hope that Lexan glass you stand behind makes you feel safer. Because I would feel safer behind my .45 than behind the plastic that can't shoot back. This message has been edited.
