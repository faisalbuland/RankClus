FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/",

Why do you suppose the FBI agents were ordered NOT to participate in the CIA interrogations in early 2002? You really need to read up on the history of torture.

This whole \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d thing has nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with trying to demonstrate a tie between 9/11 and Saddam Hussain as justification for invading Iraq. As to what works, how about the techniques used by the US Military during WWII, local police department detectives, and the FBI for years? They seem to have a pretty good success rate and can use the evidence in court (unlike what comes out of torture).

FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information.

Now trying to be fair, all participants involved need to be named and charge with your fictional law with all the grusome details. Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/ Oh, the source is FOX News.

Now trying to be fair, all participants involved need to be named and charge with your fictional law with all the grusome details. Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/",

Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/ Oh, the source is FOX News.

FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely.

Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information.

Why do you suppose the FBI agents were ordered NOT to participate in the CIA interrogations in early 2002? You really need to read up on the history of torture. Historically its main use has been to obtain public statements, video or signed documents validating the torturer\u2019s agenda. This has been the case from the Inquisitions forward to present times. This whole \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d thing has nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with trying to demonstrate a tie between 9/11 and Saddam Hussain as justification for invading Iraq. As to what works, how about the techniques used by the US Military during WWII, local police department detectives, and the FBI for years? They seem to have a pretty good success rate and can use the evidence in court (unlike what comes out of torture).

Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/",

Now trying to be fair, all participants involved need to be named and charge with your fictional law with all the grusome details. Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/ Oh, the source is FOX News.

Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ...

Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/",

Why do you suppose the FBI agents were ordered NOT to participate in the CIA interrogations in early 2002? You really need to read up on the history of torture.

This whole \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d thing has nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with trying to demonstrate a tie between 9/11 and Saddam Hussain as justification for invading Iraq. As to what works, how about the techniques used by the US Military during WWII, local police department detectives, and the FBI for years? They seem to have a pretty good success rate and can use the evidence in court (unlike what comes out of torture).

Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/",

FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep.

Why do you suppose the FBI agents were ordered NOT to participate in the CIA interrogations in early 2002? You really need to read up on the history of torture. Historically its main use has been to obtain public statements, video or signed documents validating the torturer\u2019s agenda. This has been the case from the Inquisitions forward to present times. This whole \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d thing has nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with trying to demonstrate a tie between 9/11 and Saddam Hussain as justification for invading Iraq. As to what works, how about the techniques used by the US Military during WWII, local police department detectives, and the FBI for years? They seem to have a pretty good success rate and can use the evidence in court (unlike what comes out of torture).

Now trying to be fair, all participants involved need to be named and charge with your fictional law with all the grusome details. Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/",

As you MUST be aware members of the Committee are sworn to secrecy and are NOT allowed to reveal details of any of these briefings on covert activities. By law the Administration of the day MUST keep them posted about ALL covert operations. And if they oppose such operations they can go to Congress and ask for a law, to let us say, prohibit aid to this or that group, or prohibit torture - But they are NOT allowed to say that such operations are actually occuring. Or ven if the circumstances allow them to at least mention a country - they cannot be more specific. And you would be the first to complain if this was not true. Dave",

Now trying to be fair, all participants involved need to be named and charge with your fictional law with all the grusome details. Those on the committee from 2001 to present date: \"http://intelligence.senate.gov/memberscurrent.html The story: Republicans, hoping to turn the tables on Democrats who are open to prosecuting Bush-era lawyers for justifying \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, are seeking to reveal the names of those lawmakers who were briefed on the tactics as much as seven years ago. FOX News has learned there were more than 30 meetings and briefings with members of Congress on the subject since 2002. The first such briefing dealt with the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the Al Qaeda operations chief who ran the training camps in Afghanistan where the Sept. 11 hijackers were trained. Sources said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, now the speaker of the House, attended the meeting with then-Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. (who later became CIA director), and she did not raise any objections. The briefings were given to the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate until 2006. That could cover Sen. John Rockefeller, W.Va., and Rep. Jane Harman, Calif., both Democrats, as well as Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., Sen. Richard Shelby, Ala., and Rep. Pete Hoekstra, Mich., all Republicans. Defenders of the interrogation program note that if Congress had wanted to kill the program, all it had to do was withhold funding, which didn't happen. Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has personally requested from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair an unclassified list of names of all members of Congress who attended those briefings, complete with dates and locations. He told FOXNews.com the list will probably show many members were briefed \"early and often.\" \"The purpose of this, of course, is to underscore the fact that people in Congress knew or were aware of the program, its details, and they approved of this program and authorized its funding,\" said Jamal Ware, spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have criticized President Obama for opening the door to prosecuting Justice Department lawyers who drafted the so-called \"torture memos,\" which authorized harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding. But they've also raised the point that if Democrats pursue charges against the lawyers, they'd be shielding others involved in the interrogation program. \"They can't blame the politicians in Congress who approved these tactics in 2002 because these are their friends,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail. \"So they're placing the blame on Bush administration officials, political appointees.\" It's unclear how detailed the briefings with lawmakers on the interrogation programs were. Pelosi said Thursday that at the briefing she attended, she was not told that waterboarding \"or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods\" were being used. \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative council ... opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And further, the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time,\" she said. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would follow the law with regard to the interrogation program. A number of Democrats have defended the call for probes. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has been pushing for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that he will not throw his support behind any independent commission to look into Bush-era interrogation policy until the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review late this year. \"I think that's really the direction that I'm going to follow closely. I think the intelligence committee is a bipartisan committee. They will make a public report..And then I think it's appropriate to start talking about what we do with that information. But until we get that information, I think we would all be better off just relaxing, understanding how difficult this is,\" Reid said. \"I think that we must get the information. It's spotty now, and I think that a few months waiting to determine the right way to go about this is certainly not going to hurt us.\" While some aides back the idea of an independent, 9/11 Commission-style body to investigate, FOX News has learned that Obama opposes the idea. Reid offered few details Thursday on the nature of the briefings with lawmakers, and said he doesn't remember specifically when he was briefed. \"Of course there were briefings on different subjects,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into all of this ... It's pretty clear that any time I had concerns, I raised them.\" \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/04/23/republicans-claim-lawmakers-loop-interrogations/ Oh, the source is FOX News.

The Germans were pretty civilized, and the Japanese were not totally stupid. We are not dealing with normal combatants here, they are unlike anything we have dealt with before... Why do I even bother? I'm talking to people who want to appoint sadistic terrorists lawyers before any action is taken by the US Military.. True...Kamikaze pilots and SS concentration camp commanders were certainly civilized. I guess you can dehumanize pretty much anyone to justify whatever actions you want to take, right?", 
        "reply": " You knew what I meant but decided to pick the worst examples of those previous conflicts to make a point. People have used examples from WWII to describe how tea and cookies were utilized to get intelligence from German and Japanese captors. Well that might be true but LIKE I SAID, we were not dealing with Nazi SS members or Japanese Kamakaze pilots...the most fanatical, die hards at the time. Today, you people want to use the tea and cookie tactic on the most fanatical die hards today...Not an option.",
