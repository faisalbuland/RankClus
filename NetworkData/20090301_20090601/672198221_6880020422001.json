But right now, as its remote driver inches it back and forth for a photo shoot, it\u2019s like watching Babe Ruth forced to bunt with the bases loaded. The Ripsaw, lurching and belching black puffs of smoke, somehow seems restless. Like their creation, identical twins Geoff and Mike Howe, 34, don\u2019t like to sit still for long. At age seven, they built a log cabin. Ten years later, they converted a school bus into a drivable, transforming stage for their heavy-metal band, Two Much Trouble. In 2000 they couldn\u2019t agree on their next project: Geoff favored a jet-turbine-powered off-road truck; Mike, the world\u2019s fastest tracked vehicle. \"That weekend, Mike calls me down to his garage,\" Geoff says. \"He\u2019s already got the suspension built for the Ripsaw. So we went with that.\" Every engineer they consulted said they couldn\u2019t best the 42mph top speed of an M1A Abrams, the most powerful tank in the world. Other tanks are built to protect the people inside, with frames made of heavy armored-steel plates. Designed for rugged unmanned missions, the Ripsaw just needed to go fast, so the brothers started trimming weight. First they built a frame of welded steel tubes, like the ones used by Nascar, that provides 50 percent more strength at half the weight. Ripsaw: How It Works: To glide over rough terrain at top speed, the Ripsaw has shock absorbers that provide 14 inches of travel. But when the suspension compresses, it creates slack that could cause a track to come off, potentially flipping the vehicle. So the inventors devised a spring-loaded wheel at the front that extends to keep the tracks taut. The Ripsaw has never thrown a track Bland Designs Behind the Wheel: The Ripsaw\u2019s six cameras send live, 360-degree video to a control room, where program manager Will McMaster steers the tank John B. Carnett When you reinvent the tank, finding ready-made parts is no easy task, and a tread light enough to spin at 60 mph and strong enough to hold together at that speed didn\u2019t exist. So the Howes hand-shaped steel cleats and redesigned the mechanism for connecting them in a track. (Because the patent for the mechanism, one of eight on Ripsaw components, is still pending, they will reveal only that they didn\u2019t use the typical pin-and-bushing system of connecting treads.) The two-pound cleats weigh about 90 percent less than similarly scaled tank cleats. With the combined weight savings, the Ripsaw\u2019s 650-horsepower V8 engine cranks out nine times as much horsepower per pound as an M1A Abrams.
