It is hard to imagine spending so much money and effort to surround a nation from both directions only to quit half way abruptly. 4. The economic recession has engorged the military. The army is full to capacity (I have been talking to a recruiter for several weeks). The national guard froze hiring. The Navy is full and so is the AirForce. 5. Usually the solution to deep recessions or depressions is a war to get the industry going. 6. The Barrack administration is taking a peaceful dignified diplomatic approach which means the US will not be the one to initiate. This time Israel may start the ball rolling(article --> w ww.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=91486&sectionid=351020202 ), or it could be bluffing to make Iranians make a wrong offensive move. The US, in an attempt to prevent further erosion of its foreign policy image of \"bully\" will likely be reluctant and modest at first, but at the same time can't let Israel take too many hits. 7. The US eventually will be drawn in and join Israel in a concerted effort against Iran. 8. This action rubs too close to the belly of Russia. 9. Once Russia is in (which is a big \"if\", since they may not have the economic stamina for a prolonged conflict), the gravitational pull of the situation could unravel the entire geopolitical fabric into a WW3 (with Britain once again siding with us, while other European nation being tired of the incessant middle east situation might side against). At some point, even China might have to take sides. We ought to start psyching up and get ready to kick some butt. Are we ready ? This message has been edited.

In my view the military itself is a noble institution, and should never (ever) be blamed or held responsible for political matters. It's for the same reason that when a car on the road kills my child, I can't blame the pistons or the transmission (unless there was a malfunction); it's the driver that is at fault. The force is merely a muscle carrying out the impulses of the nation's \"brain\". So, the people in the force are doing exactly their end of the job and the politicians can make them look good or bad depending on whether these politicians make good or bad political decisions. That is why I still consider joining, regardless of whether I sometimes agree or disagree with the foreign policy. It requires trust in the political process.",
