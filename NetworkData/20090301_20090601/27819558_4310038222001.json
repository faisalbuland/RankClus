The U.S. military keeps a careful watch on communications to guard against leaks of sensitive information. But the surveillance means service members are at risk if they disclose they\u2019re gay or reveal they have a same-sex partner.

It sure beats keeping in contact by using the postal service which would take a month to get a reply to a letter you sent while overseas. When in port, we would use the telephones in town but getting an English speaking operator in a foreign country could be tricky depending on which country you were in. It was safe for gays to communicate with their loved ones while overseas back then, no one read your mail and the telephone exchanges were located in town. I remember when VHS/VCR's became popular in the late 70's and that did pose a problem for me once when my mate sent me a tape. I had popped in the tape and had only watched about a minute of it when another shipmate walked in,,, being fearful that the shipmate might see or hear something that might give away my orientation, I quickly hit the eject button and pulled the tape out. The fella gave me a quizzical look and no doubt wondered why I had acted so irrationally upon seeing him enter the room. I put the tape away and never did finish watching it until I returned stateside. It was just to risky aboard ship where privacy is almost non- existent. I wonder if they have those Internet caf\u00e9's in foreign ports nowadays, if you have a laptop you could safely do E-mails while in port during liberty.",
