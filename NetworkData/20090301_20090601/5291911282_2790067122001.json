Even going so far as to campaign for permission for them to destroy precious wetlands. We lived through years of heightened traffic gridlock while access roads were built and others widened and such.

Even going so far as to campaign for permission for them to destroy precious wetlands. We lived through years of heightened traffic gridlock while access roads were built and others widened and such. Rt3 was a nightmare for several years. In other words we did anything and everything we could to bring the Giants to NJ. How did the SOBs repay us? They wouldn't even rename the team the NJ Giants! It's like they took our kindness and wiped their bottoms with it. From that day on, My favorite NFL team is any team playing against the Giants. That also goes for a crowd of other NJ football fans.
