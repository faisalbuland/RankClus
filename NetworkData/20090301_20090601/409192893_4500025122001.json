Well, that particular tax credit was granted to us and signed into law as part of the stimulus bill, right? Every bill has a dollar figure on it (cost of the bill), right? All bills that become law (and, have a dollar amount on them) are paid for through taxation, right? Ok, here is my question. If it was given to us through the stimulus bill, was the cost of the tax cuts added to the total cost of the stimulus bill (i.e. a dollar figure for that particular section)? Does anybody know what it is? Or, is it an actual change to the tax code and therefor did not add to the cost of the stimulus bill? And, yes. I do know that it temporarily changes the withholding table. But, that is not what I am asking. Did it actually add to the cost of the stimulus?",

My husband and I were talking about this earlier, how the 'extra' taxes will effect EVERY THING.. quote: According to the White Fence Index, the average home utility bill is $297 per month, which is about $3,600 per year. So a 50% increase would be $1,800 per year under the Obama proposal. This far exceeds a Heritage Foundation projection of $467 a year in higher utility bills under an earlier U.S. Senate energy tax plan. That less-aggressive plan, though, could have cost 500,000 to 1 million jobs, according to Heritage. Who knows how many jobs would be lost under Obama\u2019s more burdensome plan? The lost jobs would become \u201cgangrene jobs,\u201d a counter to Obama\u2019s claim to create new \u201cgreen jobs.\u201d The White House and Mr. Furman try to justify drastically higher energy costs by offsetting it with their plan to give 95% of American families a permanent $800 per year \u201cMaking Work Pay\u201d tax credit. (42% of that \u201ctax cut\u201d would actually go to people who don\u2019t pay any income tax.) But even with the $800 subsidy, the net loss is $1,000 per family per year. \"http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=31137\" And if you think about it, they want to go to electric cars..so who is the joke being played on?? \"http://gas2.org/2009/03/19/president-obama-announces-24-billion-in-funding-for-electric-vehicles-and-plug-in-hybrids/\"",
