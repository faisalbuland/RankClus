In some cases (like hunting waterfowl) lead projectiles can cause problems and are justifiably banned. But most hunters remove the meat of an animal that has been impacted by lead because that tissue is damaged; this reduces the likelyhood that someone will have issues with lead poisoning. I'm willing to bet that game killed by hunters is still safer than the beef and chicken you buy in grocery stores. At least wild game isn't fed newspaper, feces, and injected with steroids and hormones. Some shooting ranges are probably contaminated with lead. I have no problem with green ammunition being used there. Most indoor ranges are well ventilated and the lead is collected and recycled.",

At least wild game isn't fed newspaper, feces, and injected with steroids and hormones. Some shooting ranges are probably contaminated with lead. I have no problem with green ammunition being used there. Most indoor ranges are well ventilated and the lead is collected and recycled.",
