Related item: Under current law, a veteran rated as 100 percent disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs has no standing with the Social Security Administration in terms of receiving Social Security Disability benefits. Just in terms of redundancy, cost-avoidance, and vein-throbbing foreheads, why shouldn't congress mandate the Social Security Agency to grant full faith and credit to the disability ratings of the Department of Veterans Affairs? At some point it makes sense for the left hand to trust the right hand. I'm sure there are examples of Social Security denying disability benefits to 100 percent disabled veterans. I will personally put this theory to the test over the next 12 months(?) (or however long it takes for my claim to be processed). Benefit calculations, qualifying quarters, and all the other ratios, formulas and genuflections can remain the same. Just get Social Security to dispense with jumping through the same ritual of medical exams, opinions and bureaucratic box-checking that has already been accomplished by DVA. If DVA has a veteran at 100 percent disabled, WHY is that not good enough for SSA? Forgive the rant, but really stupid \"stuff\" still clinches my jaw.",
