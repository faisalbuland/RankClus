Known primarily as a source of immigrants throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d economic boom of the last decade and the resulting prosperity have now made the Emerald Isle an attractive destination. Ireland is also unique in the political rights it grants to noncitizens, which include voting, joining the police force, and running for local office. In the Dublin suburb of Portlaoise last summer, Nigerian-born Rotimi Adebari was elected as Ireland\u2019s first black mayor. Although a few incidents of racial harassment have been reported, the backlash has been minimal, and Ireland doesn\u2019t have the far-right nationalist parties that are common throughout the rest of Europe. Spain Where they come from: North Africa, Latin America Immigrants as percentage of population: 11 percent Why they\u2019re welcome: It\u2019s all about the growth. Like Ireland, Spain spent decades as an economic basket case, but it is now one of Europe\u2019s best-performing economies, thanks largely to its open-door immigration policy, instituted in the late 1990s. Spain has absorbed more than 3 million immigrants, and 11 percent of its population is now foreign-born. Many are attracted by Spain\u2019s thriving construction sector, and minimum-wage agriculture and service jobs are increasingly filled by immigrants. Despite some fears provoked by the 2004 Madrid train bombings, carried out in part by Moroccan immigrants, Spain is keeping the door open and responded to its illegal-immigration problem with a large-scale amnesty in 2005. It\u2019s not all good news for immigrants, though. Human Rights Watch blasted the Spanish government last summer for mistreating African migrant children at its Canary Islands detention centers. Canada Where they come from: East Asia, South Asia Immigrants as percentage of population: 19 percent Why they\u2019re welcome: The country is running out of workers. Canada\u2019s finance minister recently said that population and labor shortages are Canada\u2019s most pressing economic challenges. One out of 7 Canadians is now a senior citizen, and the country\u2019s fertility rate has been below replacement level since the early 1970s. In response, lawmakers in Ottawa are considering enhancing Canada\u2019s immigration laws, which are already among the world\u2019s most liberal. Canada has accepted around 200,000 immigrants per year over the last 10 years. Canada is also known for having a remarkably open policy for asylum seekers and accepts nearly half of those who seek refugee status. (The United States accepts less than a third.) Security concerns since 9/11 have led Canada to beef up security along its southern border and increase police surveillance powers, but these measures have not led to a decrease in immigration. Israel Where they come from: North America, the former Soviet Union Immigrants as percentage of population: 40 percent Why they\u2019re welcome:Because Israel wants to remain a Jewish state. Yasir Arafat had a point when he remarked that the Palestinians\u2019 greatest weapon is the womb. The Gaza Strip, for instance, has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing populations. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s Jewish birthrate has remained stagnant, and increasingly large numbers of young Israelis choose to emigrate as violence continues. In response, Jewish nonprofit organizations are working to entice Jews from around the world to the Holy Land, even offering grants of $3,000 to $10,000 as an incentive. Under Israeli law, Jews are automatically granted citizenship. These measures may be working. The year 2006 saw the first upswing in immigration from the United States in years. Most of Israel\u2019s new arrivals, however, are from former Soviet bloc countries, and many have only tenuous connections to Judaism. The Knesset even debated amending the \u201claw of return\u201d policy last year when police broke up a neo-Nazi group in the city of Petah Tikva. New Zealand Where they come from: East Asia and the Pacific Islands Immigrants as percentage of population: 16 percent Why they\u2019re welcome:Because New Zealand wants the best. In how many countries can you imagine a politician saying, \u201cWe are in a global race for talent and we must win our share,\u201d as New Zealand\u2019s then immigration minister did in 2005? For New Zealand, immigration is all about skills. Applicants are awarded a score based on their level of occupational ability. Those scoring above a certain level are automatically granted entrance. With high levels of economic growth and a low population, New Zealand\u2019s policies are geared toward shoring up key sectors of the country\u2019s economy. On the whole, immigrants are thriving in New Zealand\u2019s economic boom and receive public assistance at a lower level than the population at large. The good times may not last forever, though. Nationalist politicians routinely grumble about how the influx of Asian immigrants is changing the country\u2019s demographic makeup, and the government is gradually raising language and skill requirements.

Known primarily as a source of immigrants throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d economic boom of the last decade and the resulting prosperity have now made the Emerald Isle an attractive destination. Ireland is also unique in the political rights it grants to noncitizens, which include voting, joining the police force, and running for local office. In the Dublin suburb of Portlaoise last summer, Nigerian-born Rotimi Adebari was elected as Ireland\u2019s first black mayor. Although a few incidents of racial harassment have been reported, the backlash has been minimal, and Ireland doesn\u2019t have the far-right nationalist parties that are common throughout the rest of Europe. Spain Where they come from: North Africa, Latin America Immigrants as percentage of population: 11 percent Why they\u2019re welcome: It\u2019s all about the growth. Like Ireland, Spain spent decades as an economic basket case, but it is now one of Europe\u2019s best-performing economies, thanks largely to its open-door immigration policy, instituted in the late 1990s. Spain has absorbed more than 3 million immigrants, and 11 percent of its population is now foreign-born. Many are attracted by Spain\u2019s thriving construction sector, and minimum-wage agriculture and service jobs are increasingly filled by immigrants. Despite some fears provoked by the 2004 Madrid train bombings, carried out in part by Moroccan immigrants, Spain is keeping the door open and responded to its illegal-immigration problem with a large-scale amnesty in 2005. It\u2019s not all good news for immigrants, though. Human Rights Watch blasted the Spanish government last summer for mistreating African migrant children at its Canary Islands detention centers. Canada Where they come from: East Asia, South Asia Immigrants as percentage of population: 19 percent Why they\u2019re welcome: The country is running out of workers. Canada\u2019s finance minister recently said that population and labor shortages are Canada\u2019s most pressing economic challenges. One out of 7 Canadians is now a senior citizen, and the country\u2019s fertility rate has been below replacement level since the early 1970s. In response, lawmakers in Ottawa are considering enhancing Canada\u2019s immigration laws, which are already among the world\u2019s most liberal. Canada has accepted around 200,000 immigrants per year over the last 10 years. Canada is also known for having a remarkably open policy for asylum seekers and accepts nearly half of those who seek refugee status. (The United States accepts less than a third.) Security concerns since 9/11 have led Canada to beef up security along its southern border and increase police surveillance powers, but these measures have not led to a decrease in immigration. Israel Where they come from: North America, the former Soviet Union Immigrants as percentage of population: 40 percent Why they\u2019re welcome:Because Israel wants to remain a Jewish state. Yasir Arafat had a point when he remarked that the Palestinians\u2019 greatest weapon is the womb. The Gaza Strip, for instance, has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing populations. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s Jewish birthrate has remained stagnant, and increasingly large numbers of young Israelis choose to emigrate as violence continues. In response, Jewish nonprofit organizations are working to entice Jews from around the world to the Holy Land, even offering grants of $3,000 to $10,000 as an incentive. Under Israeli law, Jews are automatically granted citizenship. These measures may be working. The year 2006 saw the first upswing in immigration from the United States in years. Most of Israel\u2019s new arrivals, however, are from former Soviet bloc countries, and many have only tenuous connections to Judaism. The Knesset even debated amending the \u201claw of return\u201d policy last year when police broke up a neo-Nazi group in the city of Petah Tikva. New Zealand Where they come from: East Asia and the Pacific Islands Immigrants as percentage of population: 16 percent Why they\u2019re welcome:Because New Zealand wants the best. In how many countries can you imagine a politician saying, \u201cWe are in a global race for talent and we must win our share,\u201d as New Zealand\u2019s then immigration minister did in 2005? For New Zealand, immigration is all about skills. Applicants are awarded a score based on their level of occupational ability. Those scoring above a certain level are automatically granted entrance. With high levels of economic growth and a low population, New Zealand\u2019s policies are geared toward shoring up key sectors of the country\u2019s economy. On the whole, immigrants are thriving in New Zealand\u2019s economic boom and receive public assistance at a lower level than the population at large. The good times may not last forever, though.

Known primarily as a source of immigrants throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d economic boom of the last decade and the resulting prosperity have now made the Emerald Isle an attractive destination. Ireland is also unique in the political rights it grants to noncitizens, which include voting, joining the police force, and running for local office. In the Dublin suburb of Portlaoise last summer, Nigerian-born Rotimi Adebari was elected as Ireland\u2019s first black mayor. Although a few incidents of racial harassment have been reported, the backlash has been minimal, and Ireland doesn\u2019t have the far-right nationalist parties that are common throughout the rest of Europe. Spain Where they come from: North Africa, Latin America Immigrants as percentage of population: 11 percent Why they\u2019re welcome: It\u2019s all about the growth. Like Ireland, Spain spent decades as an economic basket case, but it is now one of Europe\u2019s best-performing economies, thanks largely to its open-door immigration policy, instituted in the late 1990s. Spain has absorbed more than 3 million immigrants, and 11 percent of its population is now foreign-born. Many are attracted by Spain\u2019s thriving construction sector, and minimum-wage agriculture and service jobs are increasingly filled by immigrants. Despite some fears provoked by the 2004 Madrid train bombings, carried out in part by Moroccan immigrants, Spain is keeping the door open and responded to its illegal-immigration problem with a large-scale amnesty in 2005. It\u2019s not all good news for immigrants, though. Human Rights Watch blasted the Spanish government last summer for mistreating African migrant children at its Canary Islands detention centers. Canada Where they come from: East Asia, South Asia Immigrants as percentage of population: 19 percent Why they\u2019re welcome: The country is running out of workers. Canada\u2019s finance minister recently said that population and labor shortages are Canada\u2019s most pressing economic challenges. One out of 7 Canadians is now a senior citizen, and the country\u2019s fertility rate has been below replacement level since the early 1970s. In response, lawmakers in Ottawa are considering enhancing Canada\u2019s immigration laws, which are already among the world\u2019s most liberal. Canada has accepted around 200,000 immigrants per year over the last 10 years. Canada is also known for having a remarkably open policy for asylum seekers and accepts nearly half of those who seek refugee status. (The United States accepts less than a third.) Security concerns since 9/11 have led Canada to beef up security along its southern border and increase police surveillance powers, but these measures have not led to a decrease in immigration. Israel Where they come from: North America, the former Soviet Union Immigrants as percentage of population: 40 percent Why they\u2019re welcome:Because Israel wants to remain a Jewish state. Yasir Arafat had a point when he remarked that the Palestinians\u2019 greatest weapon is the womb. The Gaza Strip, for instance, has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing populations. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s Jewish birthrate has remained stagnant, and increasingly large numbers of young Israelis choose to emigrate as violence continues. In response, Jewish nonprofit organizations are working to entice Jews from around the world to the Holy Land, even offering grants of $3,000 to $10,000 as an incentive. Under Israeli law, Jews are automatically granted citizenship. These measures may be working. The year 2006 saw the first upswing in immigration from the United States in years. Most of Israel\u2019s new arrivals, however, are from former Soviet bloc countries, and many have only tenuous connections to Judaism. The Knesset even debated amending the \u201claw of return\u201d policy last year when police broke up a neo-Nazi group in the city of Petah Tikva. New Zealand Where they come from: East Asia and the Pacific Islands Immigrants as percentage of population: 16 percent Why they\u2019re welcome:Because New Zealand wants the best. In how many countries can you imagine a politician saying, \u201cWe are in a global race for talent and we must win our share,\u201d as New Zealand\u2019s then immigration minister did in 2005? For New Zealand, immigration is all about skills. Applicants are awarded a score based on their level of occupational ability. Those scoring above a certain level are automatically granted entrance. With high levels of economic growth and a low population, New Zealand\u2019s policies are geared toward shoring up key sectors of the country\u2019s economy. On the whole, immigrants are thriving in New Zealand\u2019s economic boom and receive public assistance at a lower level than the population at large. The good times may not last forever, though.

It's not just crime against immigrants, they have their own cartel. Drive by shootings in Limerick and Cork are quite common. East, North and South St Louis has nothing on Dublin, Cork or Limerick.

When a pint of Guenness cost more in Dublin than in Paris, the irish are recieving exactly what they planted.
