        "content": "I was asked one day, by a young soldier, \"Why do people call me a Hero?\" A heartfelt, honest question. A question that requires much thought and introspection. A Hero, I think, describes a person, man or woman, who exemplifies all of the very best traits and qualities that we as human beings can ever hope to achieve. Hero's are not \"made\". A true Hero is born with qualities that are inherent to his or her very nature. These qualities are Sacrifice, Determination, Loyalty, Courage, Dedication, Valor, Selflessness, Conviction, Focus, Gallantry, Perseverance, Fortitude, Bravery and Compassion, to name a few. These are part of the very core or essence of what makes the person who they are. I think someone can be described as a Hero if they exhibit these qualities in their everyday life, without conscious thought. Sacrificing ones own safety or comforts in order to help a fellow human being or group of people in need, without thought of praise or reward. Determination to be willing to complete what is started, and see things through to their conclusion. Loyalty to what is right, no matter what the cost to ones self or what general opinions may be. Courage to face seemingly insurmountable odds, or dangerous situations without fear of personal loss or injury. Dedication to a goal or ideal, with selfless devotion that is wholehearted and without reservation. Valor, which is courage exhibited during extreme situations and making decisions for the greater good of the whole as opposed to an individual. Selflessness, showing unselfish concern for the welfare of others, acting with less concern for ones self. Conviction that is a strong, unshakable belief in what is right and not just what is popular. Focusing on a goal and directing all of ones energy towards a purpose for good. Gallantry, which is adventurous courage, which courts danger with a high and cheerful spirit. Perseverance despite recurrant obstacles or fear of failure. Fortitude is encountering danger and enduring pain with a steadfast and unbroken spirit. Bravery is showing courage of thought AND deed in the face of danger or fear in order to achieve the best possible outcome in spite of overwhelming odds. Compassion for others, caring about their quality of life despite issues of race, sex, gender, religious affiliation or individual beliefs. These are just some of the many characteristics that I think make a true Hero. Not only in times of war or strife, but in everyday life. Saving a fellow soldier in combat. Offering support, assistance or material posessions to someone with a greater need than your own. Facing danger in order to help a fellow human being in crisis. Teaching or mentoring others in order to help them become the best they can be. These are things I think, that define what it means to be a true Hero. Above all, the true hero has and exhibits these qualities with a humble quietness and a belief that he or she is achieving a greater goal. They do these things because it is the honorable and right thing to do, not because it is the popular belief or opinon of those around them. To ALL of our military personnel, whereever they may be, whatever their job entails, both abroad and at home, I salute you all and thank you for that you have done and continue to do four our country. And to ALL of our miltary Veterans, no matter the conflict past, present or future, for your sacrifice and patriotism, THANK YOU ALL! Most humbly and respectfully SGT Charles H. Yaichner, Jr. MEARNG, (Ret.)",
