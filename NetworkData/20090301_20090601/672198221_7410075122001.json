Correa, a leftist, has generally kept good relations with the United States as his socialist allies in Bolivia and Venezuela often clash with Washington over what they say is U.S. \"imperialism\" in Latin America. \"Foreign minister, give this gentleman 48 hours to pack up his suitcases and get out of the country,\" Correa said during his weekly media address. \"We\u2019re not going to let anyone treat us as if we were a colony here.\" He said U.S. official Armando Astorga had abruptly ended a financing agreement with local police after authorities rejected his attempts to handpick officers he wanted to manage the U.S. aid projects. \"Mr. Astorga, keep your dirty money. We don\u2019t need it. We have dignity in this country,\" Correa said. \"Ecuador doesn\u2019t need charity from anyone.\" The U.S. State Department was aware of the announcement and checking into it, spokesman Fred Lash said. more here: \"http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_55540.shtml\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
