I knew his Grandfather (third generation back) was buried at the National Cemetery here in Memphis. I was able to get a little information from cemetery staff, specifically a War Department Q.M.C. Form No.14, Internment form. It had his rank, unit, were stationed and confirmed he was Honorable discharged on Jan. 10th, 1919. Then was able to find his death certificate at the downtown Cossick Library and get a copy for 25 cents. Death certificates are a wealth of information. I'll post what happenned next alittle later.

I knew his Grandfather (third generation back) was buried at the National Cemetery here in Memphis. I was able to get a little information from cemetery staff, specifically a War Department Q.M.C. Form No.14, Internment form. It had his rank, unit, were stationed and confirmed he was Honorable discharged on Jan. 10th, 1919.

He did know his Dad's info, date of birth, state, date of death and place of death and where buried, so that got me to the 2nd generation before my own. I knew his Grandfather (third generation back) was buried at the National Cemetery here in Memphis. I was able to get a little information from cemetery staff, specifically a War Department Q.M.C. Form No.14, Internment form. It had his rank, unit, were stationed and confirmed he was Honorable discharged on Jan. 10th, 1919. Then was able to find his death certificate at the downtown Cossick Library and get a copy for 25 cents. Death certificates are a wealth of information. I'll post what happenned next alittle later.

The reason I say this is because my great great grandfather's birth certificate and death certificate are gone. In two separate places, the only thing we have is the gravestone so now we are really pushing for family to make sure they have something outside the paperwork especially if being cremated. A memorial plaque is almost a must just in case. This can happen with church records as well. Happened to our family in Ireland. the church burned down so everything for hundreds of years was lost. There is great websites out there to do your search on.",

He did know his Dad's info, date of birth, state, date of death and place of death and where buried, so that got me to the 2nd generation before my own. I knew his Grandfather (third generation back) was buried at the National Cemetery here in Memphis. I was able to get a little information from cemetery staff, specifically a War Department Q.M.C. Form No.14, Internment form. It had his rank, unit, were stationed and confirmed he was Honorable discharged on Jan. 10th, 1919. Then was able to find his death certificate at the downtown Cossick Library and get a copy for 25 cents. Death certificates are a wealth of information. I'll post what happenned next alittle later.
