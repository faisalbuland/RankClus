According to the Hebrew Bible, Keturah or Ketura was the woman whom Abraham, the patriarch of the Israelites, married after the death of his wife, Sarah. Her nationality is unknown. Keturah bore Abraham six sons, Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. Abraham probably married her after Sarah's death. If that is correct, Abraham would have been at least 137 years old\u2013his age at the time of Sarah's death. Keturah is referred to as \"Abraham's concubine\" in the Christian Bible, probably to indicate that she was not considered to be of the same dignity as Sarah, the mother of the \"chosen son\", Isaac. It is probably also for this reason that the sons of Abraham's concubines were separated from Isaac. There is no indication when that happened, other than during his lifetime. He died at the age of 175. Keturah was the mother of six sons, representing Arab tribes south and east of Palestine, so that through the offspring of Keturah Abraham became \"the father of many nations\". Some, but not all, Jewish philosophers identify Keturah with Hagar, stating that Abraham sought her out after Sarah's death. This interpretation is set forth in the Midrash and is supported by Rashi, Gur Aryeh, Keli Yakar, and Obadiah of Bertinoro. The contrary view (that Keturah was someone other than Hagar) is advocated by Rashbam, Abraham ibn Ezra, Radak, and Ramban.

Women Who Follow Moses and Mohomet at the Same Time. The New York Journal September 1890 says: From year to year the number of Jewish girls in the Orient is increasing. Daughters of pious parents, they leave their home and creed and are converted to Islam to spend their lives in the harem of some Pasha or Governor as chambermaid, companion, favorite of lawful wife, or in some other quality as the different ranks in the harem are designated. According to the official report of the Chacham Bashi, Rabbi Jacob Kovo of Salonica, eight Jewish girls were converted in that city, in Smyrna nine, in Diarbekir and Jasgat three, in Aleppo two, etc. In Tunis conversions are reported to take place almost every week. The reason of this state of affairs is of a twofold nature. Frst, the easy manner in which a conversion from Judaism to Islam is performed, as also the easy change from the Oriental family life to that of the Mahometans; and, second, the pleasant and permanent career which the harem provides. If a Jewess wishes to be converted to Islam she need not take lessons in the Koran four weeks ahead or learn by heart incomprehensible dogmas, but she simply visits a minister or a preacher of the town, who then sends for the rabbi and parents. In their presence she declares that she will leave Judaism by her own will. Then she raises her right hand and repeats the formula, \u201cEshded on le Allah illa elahi wa-Muhamad rassul Allah (I confess that there is no God but God alone, and Mahomet is his messenger), and by this declaration she becomes a Mahometan. By her new co-religionists she is not despised as a \u201cconverted Jewess,\u201d but as an erring grandchild of Chalil (Abraham) who has not entered the right path. Every Mahometan woman knows that Amena, the mother of the Prophet, was a Jewess, the niece of the Cadi (Dayan) of Mecca, Chacham Wareka, and died as a Jewess. The Prophet also had two Jewish wives; one of them was his favorite, whom he would not leave even at the hour of prayer. But her former co-religionist also do not despise a neophyte. She has not denied the one God, nor Moses, nor the Bible. She has publicly confessed that Mohomet also was a messenger of God, and such a fact even an orthodox rabbi does not deny. Mohoment was the messenger of God to the nations of the East, to whom he communicated the revelations of Moses in smaller portions. Many of these Jewish ladies of the harem are renowned for their charitable acts. Some years ago the present Emir, or Sultan, of Khive, said Mohomet Khan, brought a Jewish girl from Russia, who is at present his favorite wife. She distributed alms in the palace every Friday, the Sabbath of the Mahometans. Sultan Baber Kean, the renowned Grand Mogul of India, who resided at Cabul, Afghanistan and Nadir Shah, the most renowned ruler of Persia (died 1748), had Jewish wives, and of the first it is related in Asia that after the death of her husband she resided at Balky, where she lived as a Jewess. Several members of the ruling dynasty of Afghanistan who boast of having descended from King Saul have Jewish wives, and are partly of Jewish descent. Islam and Judaism approach much more nearly than Judaism and Christianity, and hence the professors of those two creeds assimilate better.\u201d",
