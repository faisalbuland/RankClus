We don't want the money because of the end cost to this state. At least Sarah along with a lot of others including myself, want nothing to do with the stimulus. You know, the one noone in the US can afford. I would love to get some financial help for the Animal Shelter where I work, but not from this stupid stimulus plan. It is only going to bleed us and our children dry. What is the point anyway and why can't people make it on their own, without the governments assistance. (not they are actually helping anything)Are we really just a country full of failures and cowards? Sometimes I really do wonder.", 
        "reply": " Take away your states oil revenue and you are strictly a welfare state. You already are that via your payments to, versus distributions from, the Federal Government. That is a known. Do NOT throw welfare stats willy nilly. You have FAR more on welfare than does Michigan (the only stat that is worth a damn is the stats that indicate those on welfare as a percentage of the states population). Last time I checked Michigan had a population a few multiples higher than Alaska. Your gal Sarah... TOOK 69% of what was offered... want to bet if your Legislature asks for the rest?",

We don't want the money because of the end cost to this state. At least Sarah along with a lot of others including myself, want nothing to do with the stimulus. You know, the one noone in the US can afford. I would love to get some financial help for the Animal Shelter where I work, but not from this stupid stimulus plan. It is only going to bleed us and our children dry. What is the point anyway and why can't people make it on their own, without the governments assistance. (not they are actually helping anything)Are we really just a country full of failures and cowards? Sometimes I really do wonder. Take away your states oil revenue and you are strictly a welfare state. You already are that via your payments to, versus distributions from, the Federal Government. That is a known. Do NOT throw welfare stats willy nilly. You have FAR more on welfare than does Michigan (the only stat that is worth a damn is the stats that indicate those on welfare as a percentage of the states population). Last time I checked Michigan had a population a few multiples higher than Alaska. Your gal Sarah... TOOK 69% of what was offered... want to bet if your Legislature asks for the rest?",
