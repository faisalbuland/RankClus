Seems to be a pattern developing here o deceit coming from the CIA and their new found allies, the Republicans. And of course, the Republican's are jumping on it, totally ignoring the business of the people in an effort to save Dick Cheney and George W. Bush from their rightful legacy of being the \"torture administration.\" Fact is, as I stated so many times before, the Republicans have nothing good to add to the lives of the American people, no new ideas, nothing except cover for their failures by diverting American's attention from the real issues that matter, with faux issues like this. No wonder the people don't trust their scams any longer. No wonder they lose elections. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. The pattern evolving is one we are familiar with...the Bush administration cherry-picking intelligence and information to divulge. Release the briefings and either prove that Pelosi (and now Bob Graham) are lying or prosecute the criminals that actually DID the torturing, ordered it done and tried to justify it by creating their own legal opinions on it. This is a pathetic diversion. But the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter and the BS is getting old. The investigations will become a reality as ive said for years. Yesterday I read that now there are a total of 700 architechs and engineers demanding a complete new 9/11 commission 60 more just signed on last month alone. They have a petition short only 35k signatures that will ensure it goes on a refferendum in case Obama starts playing the politics game. This he said she said BS cant continue forever. Had they had a proper investigation years ago this current series of charges would be a moot point. Guilty is guilty. And with these Bozos dealt with it would only be exposing more of what they done. Better late than never but rest assured Justice will be served its gone to far.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by SSGDuke53: Roughly two years ago this corrupt sole Pelosi went to Syria to talk with the corrupt Dictator of Syria and open her BIG MOUTH by telling the Syrians that Israel wants Peace! The problem with that is that the Israelis did not ask her to be the go between for peace talks. Pelosi is a liar who will say anything to anyone that will help herself to stay in power! Ga dam why are most of the nuts are coming from my flaky state of California who are trying their best to destroy America?!!",

Seems to be a pattern developing here o deceit coming from the CIA and their new found allies, the Republicans. And of course, the Republican's are jumping on it, totally ignoring the business of the people in an effort to save Dick Cheney and George W. Bush from their rightful legacy of being the \"torture administration.\" Fact is, as I stated so many times before, the Republicans have nothing good to add to the lives of the American people, no new ideas, nothing except cover for their failures by diverting American's attention from the real issues that matter, with faux issues like this. No wonder the people don't trust their scams any longer. No wonder they lose elections. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. The pattern evolving is one we are familiar with...the Bush administration cherry-picking intelligence and information to divulge. Release the briefings and either prove that Pelosi (and now Bob Graham) are lying or prosecute the criminals that actually DID the torturing, ordered it done and tried to justify it by creating their own legal opinions on it. This is a pathetic diversion.",

This is a pathetic diversion. But the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter and the BS is getting old. The investigations will become a reality as ive said for years. Yesterday I read that now there are a total of 700 architechs and engineers demanding a complete new 9/11 commission 60 more just signed on last month alone. They have a petition short only 35k signatures that will ensure it goes on a refferendum in case Obama starts playing the politics game. This he said she said BS cant continue forever. Had they had a proper investigation years ago this current series of charges would be a moot point. Guilty is guilty. And with these Bozos dealt with it would only be exposing more of what they done. Better late than never but rest assured Justice will be served its gone to far.",
