Why all of a sudden are the CDC and WHO so \"prepared\" for something that they would have had no clue that was coming at least in the form that it came? Were they already expecting this? Or was this something THEY were playing around with and got out of the bag? I know, it's way to early for this kind of speculation...but something just does not seem to fit right. I smell something, but not exactly sure what it is... Note this topic is CONSPIRACY THEORY. If I thought this was FACT, I would not have POSTED IT here.
