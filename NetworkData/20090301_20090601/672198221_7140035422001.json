I honestly don't believe the U.S. Navy alone bears the brunt of the responsibility for this most unfortunate situation. This deplorable situation has all the \"Red Flags\" associated with the ineptitude of our Washington Politician's !!! The American People are of course aware that their most beloved & proud Navy have for some time now not had enough ships to do their vital job !!! But this latest planned attempt to reduce the numbers even further..... is sheer insanity ! Absolute Insanity !!! The American People deserve so much better ! Thank You L. F.",
