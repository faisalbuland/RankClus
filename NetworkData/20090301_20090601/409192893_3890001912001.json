My opinions are based largely on personal experience, not propaganda. My experience of 12 months living and working with Iraqi soldiers gives me the opinion that holding people without cause is a bad thing and causes a lot of anger. Things like Abu Ghraib and Gitmo do nothing but made life more dangerous for those of us that have BTDT. Since the war we are fighting is counterinsurgency, and the last thing we need is more insurgents it is in our best interest to avoid things like holding people without cause for years on end. These people were never charged as terrorists, or as combatants. It is pretty simple, if they were captured in combat they are combatants, if there is evidence they are part of Al Qaeda they are terrorists. Many of them weren't captured by OUR troops while shooting at OUR troops. The ones in question are ethnic Uyghers (from China). Look it up, and maybe you will get a clue on what the Chinese are doing to the Uyghers and why they were likely in Afghanistan.",
