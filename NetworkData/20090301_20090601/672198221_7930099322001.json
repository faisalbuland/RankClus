Gates told an audience in New York about Specialist Zachary Boyd, routed from sleep by enemy fire on his post in eastern Afghanistan. \"He immediately grabbed his rifle and rushed into a defensive position clad in his helmet, body armor, and pink boxer shorts that said 'I Love New York,'\" Gates said Thursday night. \"Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on your perspective, an AP photographer was there for a candid shot,\" Gates continued. The photograph by David Guttenfelder ran on the front page of the New York Times and is featured in the msnbc.com slide show on this story. Gates said Boyd, from Forth Worth, Texas, later told his parents he might get fired. Gates assured his audience at the Intrepid museum, and Boyd, that his job is safe. \"Any soldier who goes into battle against the Taliban in pink boxers and flip-flops has a special kind of courage,\" Gates said, adding that Boyd may have hit on a new kind of psychological warfare. \"I can only wonder about the impact on the Taliban.

It doesn't matter much what the guys at the top have on, I hope they can stop the Talies 'dropping up'. PS the photographer should be in for a Pulitzer. If there was a firefight going on,he was 'out on the edge', lierally and metaphorically. This message has been edited. Last edited by: AliBubba, Sat 23 May 2009 05:24 AM",

Nobody's mentioned buddy's silver sneakers. Maybe they're from a 'fightin' USO troup. It surprises me that Taliban ARE still looking, and shooting, up the 'hill' in that picture.

Not often we are on the same page jack flats, but this time I could not agree with you more.. As far as I am concerned, he was right up there with his buddy is the silver shoes, and if he was dazed and confused, I leave it up to his buddies to give him a loving kick in the behind to wake him up. I am sure the guys that serve together have a way of looking out after one another and keeping each other on point. Well done specialist Boyd, even if it does earn you a wedgie from the guys in your group",
