With US and South Korean troops on high alert at the border, Chinese fishing boats were reported to be leaving the area in the Yellow Sea that was the scene of deadly naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 between the two Koreas. The communist North, which has warned it could launch an attack on the South, vowed to respond to any fresh sanctions imposed by the United Nations. (...) Tensions have been running high since Kim Jong-Il's regime tested a nuclear bomb on Monday for the second time and renounced the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. In Washington, two US defence officials said that satellite photos suggest that North Korea may be preparing to launch a long-range ballistic missile. Vehicle movements at a missile site in North Korea resemble work done before North Korea fired a long-range rocket last month, the officials told AFP on condition of anonymity. The UN Security Council unanimously condemned last month's missile launch. In response, North Korea stormed out of a US-backed six-nation disarmament deal. (...) South Korea and the United States put their troops on the Korean peninsula on higher alert on Thursday, and Seoul's defence ministry said forces were keeping a close watch on the land and sea border with the North. North Korea test-fired another missile off its east coast Friday, the sixth this week, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. There was no immediate confirmation but the agency's reports of five launches earlier this week were later confirmed by Pyongyang. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, en route to a regional security meeting in Singapore, accused the North of \"very provocative, aggressive\" actions but tried to play down the threat. Gates said he was unaware of any unusual troop movements in the North, which has around 1.1 million soldiers, compared with 680,000 South Korean and 28,500 US troops south of the border. (...) The North could also stage a third nuclear test but this would come much later than the other steps, Yang said. (...) Pyongyang warned Wednesday that it could not guarantee the safety of US or South Korean ships after Seoul said it was joining a US-led international effort to stop the trade in weapons of mass destruction. Many experts believe, however, that the North is not yet able to deliver a nuclear weapon by missile...",

The North Korean government has never really acknowledged the 1953 Armistice. As far as the North Korean people know the North won the war and that their military is the best in the world. Citizens are brainwashed from birth to believe that they are living in a workers paradise and believe that their Dear Leader would never steer them wrong... \"Kim Jong-il doesn\u2019t care if it is a no-win situation, he is a nut. He is crazy enough to believe he could win. He is also sick, probably dying. There is a power struggle amongst North Korean leadership. As has happened in the past, dictators use wars as an excuse to get the people behind them and shore up their power.\" North Korean citizens have been lied to there whole lives, believing in fake ideals. They are brainwashed into believing that his birth was foretold by a Bird and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow over a mountain and by a new star in the heavens. They believe that Kim Jong-il is more like a god than a man. The reason i say this is because North Korea is so isolated there citizens have no idea of how good people have it outside their country. At the time of the Korean War and in the years following it North Korea was like South Korea today its economy was strong and there was no end in sight thanks to Kim Il-sung's Juche Ideology. Today its the complete opposite, South Korea has thrived while the North have for years been living in poverty with the people starving to death, but the people still believe that the whole world is living worse then them. I honestly believe that if the North invades the South the DPRK Soldiers (who are Malnourished) will see how well the South Korean citizens live and how they have been lied to for so long. I believe that after they see how they live versus them (examples being how they never have breaks in there electricity in the night. How highways and roads are filled with cars. How no one is dying of starvation, No Forced labor camps.) they are going to realize that they were lied to there whole lives. I think that a lot of there soldiers will go AWOL and try to stay in the South and eventually work against the North. Kim Jong-il is only in power now because he established ignorance of the outside world in his country. Total isolation is the only way socialism will work, and if the people ever get wise and figure out that they are living a lie i think that the citizens will revolt. Kim Jong-il will not risk his regime by invading the South. Invading the South would mean the downfall of North Korea. I believe with all my heart that our military is the best the world has ever seen and in a conventional war we would win. i would take 680000 ROK soldiers and our 28000 other troops stationed on the peninsula over their million malnourished soldiers any day of the week, especially with no China backing them. North Korea doesn't have the capability to make a Nuclear bomb they are trying to test our new administration and i believe they are trying to groom a successor to Kim Jong-il. Dictators use war and fear as an excuse to get the people behind them. I don't think anything will come of this, but if it does we better pack a lunch because i have a feeling that its going to take a while. If we do go to war we have to end it right with Korea being reunified as one republic nation. I really do feel bad for the North Korean people i hope that one day they will know how it feels to be free to make there own decisions.",
