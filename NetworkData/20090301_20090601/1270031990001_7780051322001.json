To me it is just a case of no need for it to be there in the first place. Even Jesus spoke about keeping politics and religion seperate. We see in countries where religion is forced upon people, the laws tend to be the most archaic and cruel (see Saudi Arabia as an example). I don't recognize a 'duty' to worship God, and to me, that sounds almost Taliban / Wahhabistic. Furthermore, if there is a God, I don't believe they expect people to 'worship' them.

To me it is just a case of no need for it to be there in the first place. Even Jesus spoke about keeping politics and religion seperate. We see in countries where religion is forced upon people, the laws tend to be the most archaic and cruel (see Saudi Arabia as an example). I don't recognize a 'duty' to worship God, and to me, that sounds almost Taliban / Wahhabistic. Furthermore, if there is a God, I don't believe they expect people to 'worship' them. Just my thoughts. I can appreciate and also have a lot of respect for your concerns and point of view. And because we are both conscience human beings we both rationalize these same thoughts. A place where we also find commonality as did our founding fathers was in Natural Law. Man has for a long time before England or The United States been aware of the certain \"unalienable rights\" endowed to us by our \"Creator\". There are emotions and instincts that lead us to a course of action common to all man. You and I share in these laws of nature from our very first heartbeat to our last. During our lifetime we have laws of sciences and emotions that we must adhere to to survive. This is how we learn the difference between good and bad, right and wrong developing our common moral code. Our philosophical nature leads us to understand that these laws had to originate somewhere and the deeper we study either inwardly or outwardly the more we view the infinite. All of this is created by the work of something or someone far superior to man, this Supreme Being man calls God. As man has progressed he has always incorporated these laws into the laws that govern his people. The United States is maintaning that delicate balance that enables man to choose one of the many paths to their eventual end, while still allowing free will. Now, when we raise our children we want them to succeed. We teach them the laws of God and the laws of nature we have learned through centuries of knowledge passed down. And now lets say it's time for them to drive. We teach them the laws of the road. But in teaching them the laws of the road, we don't usually incorporate the philosophical or the laws of God. We already know that they understand from the earlier lessons. I mean hopefully they will not start driving into pedestrians and killing everyone they meet. So we see instead the need to focus on the laws that will ensure their safety and survival. This is much like what the founders did when they constructed the Constitution. And, they didn't want a state religion like their King emposed or a bunch of seperate roads for each religion to travel. But imagine the traffic jams of one religion purposely wrecking into another on your way to work, lol. Anyway, God is in government because the foundations of our reasoning stems from this Supreme Being and has always been our moral guidance in maintaining a civil society. God created men, these men who folowed God created this government therefore the first principle \"God\" is included and it's why all the Presidents still speak of Him. - LegionSon - This message has been edited.

And I don't see anything you posted in contradiction to anything I stated. That is good too. But you see it was not my intent to adress Freedom of Religion, although I can understand the confusion of that subject being so closely related to the subject of God. So, I will say that I believe we have succeeded very well in establishing Freedom \"Of\" Religion. And I do not appreciate this FFRF deceptive attack on Freedom Of Religion or God in their attempts at removing the hard fought after freedoms we have attained as our founding fathers envisioned. What I am showing is how the foundations of a belief in God are a part of the fabric of our Government as a whole and were since the very beginning. So then with this in mind I do disagree when you stated \"There's no push for atheist government.\" I believe the people running The FFRF hate America and our flag and the ideals for which it still stands. Why else would they want to remove God from government or monuments, coins, patriotic songs or the right to pray...it's only logical and obvious that they think a secular government is a government founded without the basis of God, and they are wrong. It is just not true, it never was. And I understand that just as in any other group it is not all of it's members that hate America. Of course not, but they are leading this country and their followers astray, plain and simple. They are divisive. We witness their tactics here on this very forum. No matter what religion or lack there of men stood proud knowing that we were free to practice our own beliefs and that is how we stood together as a cohesive unit in comaraderie. \"One Nation Under God\" allowed this cohesiveness as we have witnessed through our great history. Men felt a sense of cohesiveness and pride no matter who they stood beside in battle. Freedom was our cause. And yes we have always been a religious nation. But the word \"God\" should not be removed. That is where we got our \"Blessings of Liberty\" as stated in The Preamble to The Constitution. It was understood as \"Blessings\" from our Creator.

I have come to the understanding that America has done a great job so far. The military is a seperate entity in such a way that the necessity to maintain cohesion is of the utmost importance. I believe that is what Washington was doing when he gave the command. And still we have non-denominational prayer and this gives all the men a moment of silence at least if they wish not to pray just rejoice in our freedom. I still believe it should be required for all men to attend to remain a strong unit realizing that this moment is about defending our freedom for all involved. Every man needs a time of reflection in one form or another. Giving this time helps release stress also. It is intended to unite the men. - LegionSon -",

In fact, George Washington was whole-heartedly against the implementation of the Chaplain Corp as supported by the following quote: \"Among many other weighty objections to the Measure, it has been suggested, that it has a tendency to introduce religious disputes into the Army, which above all things should be avoided, and in many instances would compel men to a mode of Worship which they do not profess.\" - George Washington, to John Hancock, then president of Congress, expressing opposition to a congressional plan to appoint brigade chaplains in the Continental Army (1777). It was the Continental Congress that suggested the Chaplain Corp, and Washington objected. As for your second statement regarding the provisioning of religious services that Washington also ordered his men to attend, I can find no proof of this. Please provide your source or retract your statement. I also researched GW's proclamation (not his first). The idea for this proclamation began as a resolution submitted by a representative of New Jersey. It is worth mentioning that Washington declined to deliver it in person. Instead, it was included in his Circular to the Governors of the States on 3 October 1789 with the instructions that it be \"published and made known in your State in the way and manner that shall be most agreeable to yourself.\" Also worth noting, several members of congress were opposed to the resolution citing \"it is a business with which Congress have nothing to do; it is a religious matter, and, as such, is proscribed to us.\" -Thomas Tudor Tucker, Senator, South Carolina and US Treasurer. It seems to me that Washington was more likely to be paying his constituents a little lip service in light of the troubling times they had just overcome.

And also, that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions;-- to enable us all, whether in publick or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us); and to bless them with good governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and us; and, generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

I never disputed the importance of the Chaplain Corp. I disputed your statements presented in the opening post and also in the post time/dated Wed 13 May 2009 06:45 PM, and subsequently the source from which you drew them. While you presented a single quote clearly mishandled by a biased entity, I have provided 1 of many historical references maintained by an authoritative source that supports the contrary to your original statement. I'm not sure what you intended to communicate with the first 20 lines of your last post, but, as poetic as it may appear, I suspect it is nothing more than a feeble attempt to cloud your failings of supporting your argument. The dissention among the various denominations of christianity was never the reason or motivation that a government be formed, nor for the purpose of uniting all men (and women) \"under god\". That is your opinion, one that is not supported by any factual evidence or credible source. There are many incidents of the more self-righteous attempting to inject religion into politics even back then, but there are just as many incidents demonstrating our forefathers wisdom in rejecting those attempts. It is a simple thing to accept only those pieces of truth that agree with your point of view while discarding those that are not in alignment. I suggest you take some of your own advice and \"never be too proud to read and learn\". Truth out of context is still a lie.",

You attempted to change around the facts of history to suit your agenda and I disputed your version. Remember? You said that Washington petitioned Congress for a Chaplain Corp and instituted mandatory religious services. It was Congress' idea to implement the Chaplain Corp to which Washington was opposed. And there is NO evidence that Washington ever established religious service for his soldiers or that he mandated participation in said service. I'll be the first to admit that no evidence is not proof to the contrary of your statement regarding Washington's mandatory religious services. But I will require that if you want to make obviously fallatious statements, you should be prepared to provide a credible, unbiased source supporting your information for those of us who know history better than the typical layman.

My answer is because there is no reason for it to be there in the first place. What does God have to do with money? What does God have to do with Government? Why is there a prayer as the opening of a session of the Senate when there is no need for one, assuming that all of the individual Senators can pray on their own according to their own faith systems, or none at all? To me it is just a case of no need for it to be there in the first place. Even Jesus spoke about keeping politics and religion seperate. We see in countries where religion is forced upon people, the laws tend to be the most archaic and cruel (see Saudi Arabia as an example). I don't recognize a 'duty' to worship God, and to me, that sounds almost Taliban / Wahhabistic. Furthermore, if there is a God, I don't believe they expect people to 'worship' them.

I can appreciate and also have a lot of respect for your concerns and point of view. And because we are both conscience human beings we both rationalize these same thoughts. A place where we also find commonality as did our founding fathers was in Natural Law. Man has for a long time before England or The United States been aware of the certain \"unalienable rights\" endowed to us by our \"Creator\". There are emotions and instincts that lead us to a course of action common to all man. You and I share in these laws of nature from our very first heartbeat to our last. During our lifetime we have laws of sciences and emotions that we must adhere to to survive. This is how we learn the difference between good and bad, right and wrong developing our common moral code. Our philosophical nature leads us to understand that these laws had to originate somewhere and the deeper we study either inwardly or outwardly the more we view the infinite. All of this is created by the work of something or someone far superior to man, this Supreme Being man calls God. As man has progressed he has always incorporated these laws into the laws that govern his people. The United States is maintaning that delicate balance that enables man to choose one of the many paths to their eventual end, while still allowing free will. Now, when we raise our children we want them to succeed. We teach them the laws of God and the laws of nature we have learned through centuries of knowledge passed down. And now lets say it's time for them to drive. We teach them the laws of the road. But in teaching them the laws of the road, we don't usually incorporate the philosophical or the laws of God. We already know that they understand from the earlier lessons. I mean hopefully they will not start driving into pedestrians and killing everyone they meet. So we see instead the need to focus on the laws that will ensure their safety and survival. This is much like what the founders did when they constructed the Constitution. And, they didn't want a state religion like their King emposed or a bunch of seperate roads for each religion to travel. But imagine the traffic jams of one religion purposely wrecking into another on your way to work, lol. Anyway, God is in government because the foundations of our reasoning stems from this Supreme Being and has always been our moral guidance in maintaining a civil society. God created men, these men who folowed God created this government therefore the first principle \"God\" is included and it's why all the Presidents still speak of Him. - LegionSon - This message has been edited.

And I don't see anything you posted in contradiction to anything I stated. That is good too. But you see it was not my intent to adress Freedom of Religion, although I can understand the confusion of that subject being so closely related to the subject of God. So, I will say that I believe we have succeeded very well in establishing Freedom \"Of\" Religion. And I do not appreciate this FFRF deceptive attack on Freedom Of Religion or God in their attempts at removing the hard fought after freedoms we have attained as our founding fathers envisioned. What I am showing is how the foundations of a belief in God are a part of the fabric of our Government as a whole and were since the very beginning. So then with this in mind I do disagree when you stated \"There's no push for atheist government.\" I believe the people running The FFRF hate America and our flag and the ideals for which it still stands. Why else would they want to remove God from government or monuments, coins, patriotic songs or the right to pray...it's only logical and obvious that they think a secular government is a government founded without the basis of God, and they are wrong. It is just not true, it never was. And I understand that just as in any other group it is not all of it's members that hate America. Of course not, but they are leading this country and their followers astray, plain and simple. They are divisive. We witness their tactics here on this very forum. No matter what religion or lack there of men stood proud knowing that we were free to practice our own beliefs and that is how we stood together as a cohesive unit in comaraderie. \"One Nation Under God\" allowed this cohesiveness as we have witnessed through our great history. Men felt a sense of cohesiveness and pride no matter who they stood beside in battle. Freedom was our cause. And yes we have always been a religious nation. But the word \"God\" should not be removed. That is where we got our \"Blessings of Liberty\" as stated in The Preamble to The Constitution. It was understood as \"Blessings\" from our Creator. And as I tried to show the reasons in an earlier post of why it was constructed in this fashion, the Constitution is not the totality of our government. There is so much freedom behind the words \"In God We Trust\", The history of this great nation has proven that.

I'd call it unconstitutional for Washington to do so, but in reality, the Constitution was not written yet, so I guess he gets a pass for that. However, forcing people to go to church should be in violation of any concept of free will. If men are forced to go to church against their will, can't you see how they might develop a dislike for the message? How many Christians go to church every Sunday only because they feel a moral obligation to do so? How many Muslims drag through the motions of their five prayers a day, wishing that they could talk to their maker on their own terms, and not according to some ritualistic dogma that they have been taught is somehow required? How many atheists and agnostics have been required to endure religious ceremonies that mean nothing to them, but for years have had to attend, either mandated directly or indirectly? At what point does free will get tossed out the door and imposed will becomes the norm? You can see it in Saudi, where bands of religious police, accountable to no one, roam the streets and beat Muslims for not being in the mosque at prayer time (among other things). Think that can't happen here? Just a little something to think about... Yes AKinNC, it is very good that we always continue to think about such things. I have come to the understanding that America has done a great job so far. The military is a seperate entity in such a way that the necessity to maintain cohesion is of the utmost importance. I believe that is what Washington was doing when he gave the command. And still we have non-denominational prayer and this gives all the men a moment of silence at least if they wish not to pray just rejoice in our freedom. I still believe it should be required for all men to attend to remain a strong unit realizing that this moment is about defending our freedom for all involved. Every man needs a time of reflection in one form or another. Giving this time helps release stress also. It is intended to unite the men. - LegionSon -",

Not exactly the poster-child for accuracy. They have on many occassions misquoted sources and taken out of context material for the very purpose of supporting their views.

I never disputed the importance of the Chaplain Corp. I disputed your statements presented in the opening post and also in the post time/dated Wed 13 May 2009 06:45 PM, and subsequently the source from which you drew them. While you presented a single quote clearly mishandled by a biased entity, I have provided 1 of many historical references maintained by an authoritative source that supports the contrary to your original statement. I'm not sure what you intended to communicate with the first 20 lines of your last post, but, as poetic as it may appear, I suspect it is nothing more than a feeble attempt to cloud your failings of supporting your argument. The dissention among the various denominations of christianity was never the reason or motivation that a government be formed, nor for the purpose of uniting all men (and women) \"under god\". That is your opinion, one that is not supported by any factual evidence or credible source. There are many incidents of the more self-righteous attempting to inject religion into politics even back then, but there are just as many incidents demonstrating our forefathers wisdom in rejecting those attempts. It is a simple thing to accept only those pieces of truth that agree with your point of view while discarding those that are not in alignment. I suggest you take some of your own advice and \"never be too proud to read and learn\". Truth out of context is still a lie.",

You attempted to change around the facts of history to suit your agenda and I disputed your version. Remember? You said that Washington petitioned Congress for a Chaplain Corp and instituted mandatory religious services. It was Congress' idea to implement the Chaplain Corp to which Washington was opposed. And there is NO evidence that Washington ever established religious service for his soldiers or that he mandated participation in said service. I'll be the first to admit that no evidence is not proof to the contrary of your statement regarding Washington's mandatory religious services. But I will require that if you want to make obviously fallatious statements, you should be prepared to provide a credible, unbiased source supporting your information for those of us who know history better than the typical layman.

Constitution of South Carolina - March 26, 1776 no jesus,god,Christ, or Christian mentioned other than this \"the parish of Christ Church, six members; the parish of Saint John, in Berkely County, six member\" which is about the # of representatives. Constitution of New Jersey; 1776 XVIII. That no person shall ever, within this Colony, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping Almighty God in a manner, agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; nor, under any presence whatever, be compelled to attend any place of worship, contrary to his own faith and judgment; nor shall any person, within this Colony, ever be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or any other rates, for the purpose of building or repairing any other church or churches, place or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or has deliberately or voluntarily engaged himself to perform. Constitution of New Hampshire - 1776 no jesus,god,Christ, or Christian mentioned I guess when they wrote up the first Constitutions for the states and this nation -- they just forgot to include jesus? [Note I really liked Delawares Constitution of 1776] == Savage Do you believe that Jesus Christ is \"God\", your \"Creator\", \"Almighty God\", \"A Supreme Being\"...because I never mentioned Christianity as you falsely claimed I did in your opening remark. Now try rereading all the seperate Constitutions with God in mind and you will see where you have just made my point, thank you for you support. - LegionSon -",

My answer is because there is no reason for it to be there in the first place. What does God have to do with money? What does God have to do with Government? Why is there a prayer as the opening of a session of the Senate when there is no need for one, assuming that all of the individual Senators can pray on their own according to their own faith systems, or none at all? To me it is just a case of no need for it to be there in the first place. Even Jesus spoke about keeping politics and religion seperate. We see in countries where religion is forced upon people, the laws tend to be the most archaic and cruel (see Saudi Arabia as an example). I don't recognize a 'duty' to worship God, and to me, that sounds almost Taliban / Wahhabistic. Furthermore, if there is a God, I don't believe they expect people to 'worship' them.

I can appreciate and also have a lot of respect for your concerns and point of view. And because we are both conscience human beings we both rationalize these same thoughts. A place where we also find commonality as did our founding fathers was in Natural Law. Man has for a long time before England or The United States been aware of the certain \"unalienable rights\" endowed to us by our \"Creator\". There are emotions and instincts that lead us to a course of action common to all man. You and I share in these laws of nature from our very first heartbeat to our last. During our lifetime we have laws of sciences and emotions that we must adhere to to survive. This is how we learn the difference between good and bad, right and wrong developing our common moral code. Our philosophical nature leads us to understand that these laws had to originate somewhere and the deeper we study either inwardly or outwardly the more we view the infinite. All of this is created by the work of something or someone far superior to man, this Supreme Being man calls God. As man has progressed he has always incorporated these laws into the laws that govern his people. The United States is maintaning that delicate balance that enables man to choose one of the many paths to their eventual end, while still allowing free will. Now, when we raise our children we want them to succeed. We teach them the laws of God and the laws of nature we have learned through centuries of knowledge passed down. And now lets say it's time for them to drive. We teach them the laws of the road. But in teaching them the laws of the road, we don't usually incorporate the philosophical or the laws of God. We already know that they understand from the earlier lessons. I mean hopefully they will not start driving into pedestrians and killing everyone they meet. So we see instead the need to focus on the laws that will ensure their safety and survival. This is much like what the founders did when they constructed the Constitution. And, they didn't want a state religion like their King emposed or a bunch of seperate roads for each religion to travel. But imagine the traffic jams of one religion purposely wrecking into another on your way to work, lol. Anyway, God is in government because the foundations of our reasoning stems from this Supreme Being and has always been our moral guidance in maintaining a civil society. God created men, these men who folowed God created this government therefore the first principle \"God\" is included and it's why all the Presidents still speak of Him. - LegionSon - This message has been edited.

Don't you just love how they skew the meaning by changing the word \"Of \" to \"From\"<---it is a good representation of their dishonesty. They try to influence this same flawed ideal when trying to assert their rights.

Maybe that should be something to look into as a medical practice? But you know, LS, he wasn't like you. He wasn't fond of Papists. And he said less about religion in his whole life than you have posted on here in a few weeks! He was a Mason. Many Xian don't go for that mystical crapp either. How about you? Why is it so important to 'preserve' the religious myths? Think that might help in some magical way? I think it's too late.",

And the way you get unravelled with \"God talk\" you are making me wonder if you just might be a member of that hate group \"Freedom From Religion Foundation\" with your relentless attacks on any posts that speak of God or religion in a favorable light. Don't you just love how they skew the meaning by changing the word \"Of \" to \"From\"<---it is a good representation of their dishonesty. They try to influence this same flawed ideal when trying to assert their rights.

And I don't see anything you posted in contradiction to anything I stated. That is good too. But you see it was not my intent to adress Freedom of Religion, although I can understand the confusion of that subject being so closely related to the subject of God. So, I will say that I believe we have succeeded very well in establishing Freedom \"Of\" Religion. And I do not appreciate this FFRF deceptive attack on Freedom Of Religion or God in their attempts at removing the hard fought after freedoms we have attained as our founding fathers envisioned. What I am showing is how the foundations of a belief in God are a part of the fabric of our Government as a whole and were since the very beginning. So then with this in mind I do disagree when you stated \"There's no push for atheist government.\" I believe the people running The FFRF hate America and our flag and the ideals for which it still stands. Why else would they want to remove God from government or monuments, coins, patriotic songs or the right to pray...it's only logical and obvious that they think a secular government is a government founded without the basis of God, and they are wrong. It is just not true, it never was. And I understand that just as in any other group it is not all of it's members that hate America. Of course not, but they are leading this country and their followers astray, plain and simple. They are divisive. We witness their tactics here on this very forum. No matter what religion or lack there of men stood proud knowing that we were free to practice our own beliefs and that is how we stood together as a cohesive unit in comaraderie. \"One Nation Under God\" allowed this cohesiveness as we have witnessed through our great history. Men felt a sense of cohesiveness and pride no matter who they stood beside in battle. Freedom was our cause. And yes we have always been a religious nation. But the word \"God\" should not be removed. That is where we got our \"Blessings of Liberty\" as stated in The Preamble to The Constitution. It was understood as \"Blessings\" from our Creator.

In fact, George Washington was whole-heartedly against the implementation of the Chaplain Corp as supported by the following quote: \"Among many other weighty objections to the Measure, it has been suggested, that it has a tendency to introduce religious disputes into the Army, which above all things should be avoided, and in many instances would compel men to a mode of Worship which they do not profess.\" - George Washington, to John Hancock, then president of Congress, expressing opposition to a congressional plan to appoint brigade chaplains in the Continental Army (1777). It was the Continental Congress that suggested the Chaplain Corp, and Washington objected.

In fact, George Washington was whole-heartedly against the implementation of the Chaplain Corp as supported by the following quote: \"Among many other weighty objections to the Measure, it has been suggested, that it has a tendency to introduce religious disputes into the Army, which above all things should be avoided, and in many instances would compel men to a mode of Worship which they do not profess.\" - George Washington, to John Hancock, then president of Congress, expressing opposition to a congressional plan to appoint brigade chaplains in the Continental Army (1777).

I never disputed the importance of the Chaplain Corp. I disputed your statements presented in the opening post and also in the post time/dated Wed 13 May 2009 06:45 PM, and subsequently the source from which you drew them. While you presented a single quote clearly mishandled by a biased entity, I have provided 1 of many historical references maintained by an authoritative source that supports the contrary to your original statement. I'm not sure what you intended to communicate with the first 20 lines of your last post, but, as poetic as it may appear, I suspect it is nothing more than a feeble attempt to cloud your failings of supporting your argument. The dissention among the various denominations of christianity was never the reason or motivation that a government be formed, nor for the purpose of uniting all men (and women) \"under god\". That is your opinion, one that is not supported by any factual evidence or credible source. There are many incidents of the more self-righteous attempting to inject religion into politics even back then, but there are just as many incidents demonstrating our forefathers wisdom in rejecting those attempts. It is a simple thing to accept only those pieces of truth that agree with your point of view while discarding those that are not in alignment. I suggest you take some of your own advice and \"never be too proud to read and learn\". Truth out of context is still a lie.",

You attempted to change around the facts of history to suit your agenda and I disputed your version. Remember? You said that Washington petitioned Congress for a Chaplain Corp and instituted mandatory religious services. It was Congress' idea to implement the Chaplain Corp to which Washington was opposed. And there is NO evidence that Washington ever established religious service for his soldiers or that he mandated participation in said service. I'll be the first to admit that no evidence is not proof to the contrary of your statement regarding Washington's mandatory religious services. But I will require that if you want to make obviously fallatious statements, you should be prepared to provide a credible, unbiased source supporting your information for those of us who know history better than the typical layman. This has nothing to do with the difference between God and a state religion. Jesus doesn't need you to lie for him. This message has been edited. Last edited by: sabow, Fri 15 May 2009 09:57 AM",
