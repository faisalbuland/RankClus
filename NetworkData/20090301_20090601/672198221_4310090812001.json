He claimed that changed governmnt policies were weakening America's ability to defend against 'terror'. One of those 'defenses' was torture, prescribed by Mr.Cheney himself. In a related story, a new book detailing torture techniques used in US establishments in Afghanistan,Iraq and Guantanamo was released on Monday.

The subject, however, is fairly-well documented in other sources. In a third related story, and one that may affect Mr. Cheney personally in future, is a report that peace groups had attempted to have war crimes charges laid against ex-president Bush on a speaking engagement in Canada this week. \"If not this time,there will be another.\", the leader of the group is quoted as saying.",
