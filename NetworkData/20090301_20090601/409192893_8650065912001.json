        "content": "For anyone who's interested in properly arming themselves while they still can: As some of you will recall, a couple months ago I started a thread mentioning that I was picking up a GP WASR 10/63 semi-auto AK clone while I still could, before B.O.'s impending trampling of our 2nd Amendment rights with a new, more restrictive, no-sunset \"AW\"B. That rifle was built from old mil-spec Romanian parts, (matching set), on a new Romanian receiver. It had nice hardwood handguards, (as opposed to laminate), and it was built well overall. So she worked well, but she wasn't very pretty. I found an interested local buyer and sold it for $800 cash face-to-face. Yeah, I did well on that deal. Anyway.. I did some more research of the currently available semi-auto AK's and their manufacturers etc and I determined that the best way to go was to buy one newly manufactured by actual Russians at their Izhmash arms factory. Some here will recognize that as the factory that exports \"sporting\" Saiga \"self-loading hunting carbines\" to the US. The way they're generally imported is as a neutered \"hunting\" semi-auto AK, with a monte carlo stock, the trigger group moved rearward to accommodate that, without the ability to accept \"high capacity\" magazines, and no barrel threading or bayonet lug. Many people buy them that way and then \"convert\" em themselves, to use a proper pistol grip and use proper 30 round mags. They're excellent quality rifles, but I didn't want to buy a project, I wanted to buy a complete weapon. So.. I found that Arsenal Inc. working together with Legion, (the custom rifle shop at Izhmash), have started offering a \"de-sporterized\", proper mil-spec rifle, that's still new Russian production. It's basically a semi-auto AK103, (minus the cool, unique folding stock). They call it the Arsenal SGL20. I finally picked mine up on Monday.. and it is one amazing rifle. It is built as perfectly as the AK design allows, with all the military features, (besides selective fire), such as pistol grip, (of course), dimples in the receiver above the magazine well, barrel threaded for the AK74 muzzle brake, and forward positioned bayonet lug to allow bayonets to be attached with that larger brake. Her action is smooth as buttah and she is the most accurate AK I've ever fired, (<1\" groups at 50 yrds). They're currently going for ~$950 online. I advise anyone who is looking for a very high quality stamped receiver AK to look into Arsenal's products.. both the Russian SGL20 and the excellent Bulgarian AK models they offer. All are new production rifles, which really sets them apart in the AK market. A company called Lancaster also offers AK rifles that look good for around that price, but their parts are inferior, (Romanian \"G\" parts kits), the build of the rifles is sometimes terrible, (like the one I bought and returned unfired), and their customer service is atrocious. Avoid their products. Here are a few pics: This message has been edited. Last edited by: shades_of_grey, Wed 01 April 2009 09:38 PM",

I'd hate to have to hump 20 miles with one, it would seem like it weighed about 100 lbs when you got done. Kalishnikov got it right though. Easy and extremely reliable... quite the man stopper. Excellent home weapon... especially if someone decides to pull a home invasion when that things close by. Save everyone the trouble of a trial...

I have to laugh at the lunacy of someone trying to use an AK as a \"home defense weapon\" - in the very short distances (20 yards or less) that you are likely to have to fire upon a burglar at, the AK is going to do more (to the shooter or those he/she loves) harm than good.

Like LOA1 said, the AK round has a very high chance of going through your walls and into your neighbor's house - and if you accidentally kill your neighbor or one of his family members shooting at a burglar, it's you who's in deep chit with the law. The SGL20's not necessarily for \"home defense\", PD, it's for \"Constitution defense\". For home defense I have a Saiga 12 gauge semi-auto shotgun, (another \"eeeeeeeeevil\" weapon B.O. plans to ban by name), and several 12 round magazines for it that can handle up to 3\" magnum slugs, buckshot etc. That one is my project gun. It's Russian, made by Izhmash just like currently produced AK's. It is about 85% identical to an AK.. the way the action, gas piston, safety lever works is all the same.. basically a 12 gauge AK. It is currently equipped with the \"sporting\" monte carlo stock that it has to be imported with, but I've got the parts ordered and on the way to replace the trigger group and move it forward, install a pistol grip where it should go, and install a skeletonized side-folding stock. Oh.. and a forward tri-rail system to mount a vertical foregrip and tac flashlight etc. I'll take a few pics of it and post em later tonight, so you can see what I'm talking about.",

With the magazine release it is a simple operation, but because of its location does not make for as fast a reload in a tactical situation as the M-16. The M-16 is one smooth motion hit the magazine release with the firing and insert new magazine. Granted our AKs were old and had been used for years, and the M-16s were brand new so that accounts for some of the difference. However, the overall weight and balance of the M-16s is better.

Since you were using old beat-up AK's and brand new M16's, the observations you made concerning their comparative accuracy, (at least at those short ranges), are pretty invalid. Apples and oranges. Your other points regarding the lighter weight of the M16 and its variants are valid, but there are tradeoffs either way. Sure the ammo's lighter.. the 5.56 round is smaller and less damaging. The AR vs AK argument has been raging for decades and there's really no need to rehash it here. They're different weapons and each has advantages and disadvantages. To each his own. I'd prefer a quality AK over an AR personally, more especially if the AK had selective fire, as it's supposed to. It really shines on full-auto, which is how it was designed to be primarily used.

        "content": "For anyone who's interested in properly arming themselves while they still can: As some of you will recall, a couple months ago I started a thread mentioning that I was picking up a GP WASR 10/63 semi-auto AK clone while I still could, before B.O.'s impending trampling of our 2nd Amendment rights with a new, more restrictive, no-sunset \"AW\"B. That rifle was built from old mil-spec Romanian parts, (matching set), on a new Romanian receiver. It had nice hardwood handguards, (as opposed to laminate), and it was built well overall. So she worked well, but she wasn't very pretty. I found an interested local buyer and sold it for $800 cash face-to-face. Yeah, I did well on that deal. Anyway.. I did some more research of the currently available semi-auto AK's and their manufacturers etc and I determined that the best way to go was to buy one newly manufactured by actual Russians at their Izhmash arms factory. Some here will recognize that as the factory that exports \"sporting\" Saiga \"self-loading hunting carbines\" to the US. The way they're generally imported is as a neutered \"hunting\" semi-auto AK, with a monte carlo stock, the trigger group moved rearward to accommodate that, without the ability to accept \"high capacity\" magazines, and no barrel threading or bayonet lug. Many people buy them that way and then \"convert\" em themselves, to use a proper pistol grip and use proper 30 round mags. They're excellent quality rifles, but I didn't want to buy a project, I wanted to buy a complete weapon. So.. I found that Arsenal Inc. working together with Legion, (the custom rifle shop at Izhmash), have started offering a \"de-sporterized\", proper mil-spec rifle, that's still new Russian production. It's basically a semi-auto AK103, (minus the cool, unique folding stock). They call it the Arsenal SGL20. I finally picked mine up on Monday.. and it is one amazing rifle. It is built as perfectly as the AK design allows, with all the military features, (besides selective fire), such as pistol grip, (of course), dimples in the receiver above the magazine well, barrel threaded for the AK74 muzzle brake, and forward positioned bayonet lug to allow bayonets to be attached with that larger brake. Her action is smooth as buttah and she is the most accurate AK I've ever fired, (<1\" groups at 50 yrds). They're currently going for ~$950 online. I advise anyone who is looking for a very high quality stamped receiver AK to look into Arsenal's products.. both the Russian SGL20 and the excellent Bulgarian AK models they offer. All are new production rifles, which really sets them apart in the AK market. A company called Lancaster also offers AK rifles that look good for around that price, but their parts are inferior, (Romanian \"G\" parts kits), the build of the rifles is sometimes terrible, (like the one I bought and returned unfired), and their customer service is atrocious. Avoid their products. Here are a few pics: This message has been edited. Last edited by: shades_of_grey, Wed 01 April 2009 09:38 PM",

        "reply": "For anyone who's interested in properly arming themselves while they still can: As some of you will recall, a couple months ago I started a thread mentioning that I was picking up a GP WASR 10/63 semi-auto AK clone while I still could, before B.O.'s impending trampling of our 2nd Amendment rights with a new, more restrictive, no-sunset \"AW\"B. That rifle was built from old mil-spec Romanian parts, (matching set), on a new Romanian receiver. It had nice hardwood handguards, (as opposed to laminate), and it was built well overall. So she worked well, but she wasn't very pretty. I found an interested local buyer and sold it for $800 cash face-to-face. Yeah, I did well on that deal. Anyway.. I did some more research of the currently available semi-auto AK's and their manufacturers etc and I determined that the best way to go was to buy one newly manufactured by actual Russians at their Izhmash arms factory. Some here will recognize that as the factory that exports \"sporting\" Saiga \"self-loading hunting carbines\" to the US. The way they're generally imported is as a neutered \"hunting\" semi-auto AK, with a monte carlo stock, the trigger group moved rearward to accommodate that, without the ability to accept \"high capacity\" magazines, and no barrel threading or bayonet lug. Many people buy them that way and then \"convert\" em themselves, to use a proper pistol grip and use proper 30 round mags. They're excellent quality rifles, but I didn't want to buy a project, I wanted to buy a complete weapon. So.. I found that Arsenal Inc. working together with Legion, (the custom rifle shop at Izhmash), have started offering a \"de-sporterized\", proper mil-spec rifle, that's still new Russian production. It's basically a semi-auto AK103, (minus the cool, unique folding stock). They call it the Arsenal SGL20. I finally picked mine up on Monday.. and it is one amazing rifle. It is built as perfectly as the AK design allows, with all the military features, (besides selective fire), such as pistol grip, (of course), dimples in the receiver above the magazine well, barrel threaded for the AK74 muzzle brake, and forward positioned bayonet lug to allow bayonets to be attached with that larger brake. Her action is smooth as buttah and she is the most accurate AK I've ever fired, (<1\" groups at 50 yrds). They're currently going for ~$950 online. I advise anyone who is looking for a very high quality stamped receiver AK to look into Arsenal's products.. both the Russian SGL20 and the excellent Bulgarian AK models they offer. All are new production rifles, which really sets them apart in the AK market. A company called Lancaster also offers AK rifles that look good for around that price, but their parts are inferior, (Romanian \"G\" parts kits), the build of the rifles is sometimes terrible, (like the one I bought and returned unfired), and their customer service is atrocious. Avoid their products. Here are a few pics: This message has been edited. Last edited by: shades_of_grey, Wed 01 April 2009 09:38 PM",

But I have to be honest, I've held and shot a couple AK's and I never really got bit by the bug. I know they are one hell of a weapon, but they seem a little 'heavy handed' to me, if you know what I mean. I'd hate to have to hump 20 miles with one, it would seem like it weighed about 100 lbs when you got done. Kalishnikov got it right though. Easy and extremely reliable... quite the man stopper. Excellent home weapon... especially if someone decides to pull a home invasion when that things close by. Save everyone the trouble of a trial... Nice weapon... you gonna put light and any other sights on it?",

I keep a semi-auto Smith&Wesson .40 pistol for that. When it comes to intermediate and long range work, I still am a firm believer that I can do a he11 of a lot more damage and chaos to a bad guy with my scoped .30-06 Remington 700 bolt action deer rifle than you could with a semi-auto AK/AK clone. Like LOA1 said, the AK round has a very high chance of going through your walls and into your neighbor's house - and if you accidentally kill your neighbor or one of his family members shooting at a burglar, it's you who's in deep chit with the law. The SGL20's not necessarily for \"home defense\", PD, it's for \"Constitution defense\". For home defense I have a Saiga 12 gauge semi-auto shotgun, (another \"eeeeeeeeevil\" weapon B.O. plans to ban by name), and several 12 round magazines for it that can handle up to 3\" magnum slugs, buckshot etc. That one is my project gun. It's Russian, made by Izhmash just like currently produced AK's. It is about 85% identical to an AK.. the way the action, gas piston, safety lever works is all the same.. basically a 12 gauge AK. It is currently equipped with the \"sporting\" monte carlo stock that it has to be imported with, but I've got the parts ordered and on the way to replace the trigger group and move it forward, install a pistol grip where it should go, and install a skeletonized side-folding stock. Oh.. and a forward tri-rail system to mount a vertical foregrip and tac flashlight etc. I'll take a few pics of it and post em later tonight, so you can see what I'm talking about.",

M16's treated half as badly for half as long would not. Besides, the 7.62x39 creates much larger wounds, increasing the potency of each round that does strike the target. They also penetrate cover much better than 5.56's do. As for the magazine release being \"tricky\", I don't know how it could be any simpler. It's a hinged piece of steel.. how can anyone fack up its operation? Who was having trouble with it, the Iraqis or you or..? By looking at your profile it seems that you haven't served in Iraq, so how would you know how Iraqis can shoot. With the magazine release it is a simple operation, but because of its location does not make for as fast a reload in a tactical situation as the M-16. The M-16 is one smooth motion hit the magazine release with the firing and insert new magazine. Granted our AKs were old and had been used for years, and the M-16s were brand new so that accounts for some of the difference. However, the overall weight and balance of the M-16s is better. Personally I'll take an M-16 or especially an M-4 like I carried in Iraq due to weight and the weight of the ammunition. Also due to the length of the magazine the AK-47 is harder to fire from the prone. That's right, I didn't serve in Iraq. I have two brothers who did. I'll take their word on Iraqi shooting prowess, or lack thereof. Thanks for clarifying what you meant by a \"tricky\" mag release. I will agree that it can be more difficult to change mags out quickly with an AK, but anything can be done with practice. Since you were using old beat-up AK's and brand new M16's, the observations you made concerning their comparative accuracy, (at least at those short ranges), are pretty invalid. Apples and oranges. Your other points regarding the lighter weight of the M16 and its variants are valid, but there are tradeoffs either way. Sure the ammo's lighter.. the 5.56 round is smaller and less damaging. The AR vs AK argument has been raging for decades and there's really no need to rehash it here. They're different weapons and each has advantages and disadvantages. To each his own. I'd prefer a quality AK over an AR personally, more especially if the AK had selective fire, as it's supposed to. It really shines on full-auto, which is how it was designed to be primarily used. The safety/selector lever goes from safe, to full-auto, then to semi-auto. That tells you something.",

No AK can compete with the accuracy of that AR you built at that range, (~600 yards). They were never meant to.

Their max effective range is about 500 yards. Beyond that their bullets can be lethal of course, but if someone were hit with one at over ~550 yards it'd be due more to bad luck than deliberate intent of the shooter. You're even more into firearms than I am, Ira.. from what I can tell. I recommend that you pick up a quality semi-auto AK, I think you'd fall in love with her simplicity and effectiveness the first time you took her to the range, just as I did.

        "content": "For anyone who's interested in properly arming themselves while they still can: As some of you will recall, a couple months ago I started a thread mentioning that I was picking up a GP WASR 10/63 semi-auto AK clone while I still could, before B.O.'s impending trampling of our 2nd Amendment rights with a new, more restrictive, no-sunset \"AW\"B. That rifle was built from old mil-spec Romanian parts, (matching set), on a new Romanian receiver. It had nice hardwood handguards, (as opposed to laminate), and it was built well overall. So she worked well, but she wasn't very pretty. I found an interested local buyer and sold it for $800 cash face-to-face. Yeah, I did well on that deal. Anyway.. I did some more research of the currently available semi-auto AK's and their manufacturers etc and I determined that the best way to go was to buy one newly manufactured by actual Russians at their Izhmash arms factory. Some here will recognize that as the factory that exports \"sporting\" Saiga \"self-loading hunting carbines\" to the US. The way they're generally imported is as a neutered \"hunting\" semi-auto AK, with a monte carlo stock, the trigger group moved rearward to accommodate that, without the ability to accept \"high capacity\" magazines, and no barrel threading or bayonet lug. Many people buy them that way and then \"convert\" em themselves, to use a proper pistol grip and use proper 30 round mags. They're excellent quality rifles, but I didn't want to buy a project, I wanted to buy a complete weapon. So.. I found that Arsenal Inc. working together with Legion, (the custom rifle shop at Izhmash), have started offering a \"de-sporterized\", proper mil-spec rifle, that's still new Russian production. It's basically a semi-auto AK103, (minus the cool, unique folding stock). They call it the Arsenal SGL20. I finally picked mine up on Monday.. and it is one amazing rifle. It is built as perfectly as the AK design allows, with all the military features, (besides selective fire), such as pistol grip, (of course), dimples in the receiver above the magazine well, barrel threaded for the AK74 muzzle brake, and forward positioned bayonet lug to allow bayonets to be attached with that larger brake. Her action is smooth as buttah and she is the most accurate AK I've ever fired, (<1\" groups at 50 yrds). They're currently going for ~$950 online. I advise anyone who is looking for a very high quality stamped receiver AK to look into Arsenal's products.. both the Russian SGL20 and the excellent Bulgarian AK models they offer. All are new production rifles, which really sets them apart in the AK market. A company called Lancaster also offers AK rifles that look good for around that price, but their parts are inferior, (Romanian \"G\" parts kits), the build of the rifles is sometimes terrible, (like the one I bought and returned unfired), and their customer service is atrocious. Avoid their products. Here are a few pics: This message has been edited. Last edited by: shades_of_grey, Wed 01 April 2009 09:38 PM",

I'd hate to have to hump 20 miles with one, it would seem like it weighed about 100 lbs when you got done. Kalishnikov got it right though. Easy and extremely reliable... quite the man stopper. Excellent home weapon... especially if someone decides to pull a home invasion when that things close by. Save everyone the trouble of a trial...

The SGL20's not necessarily for \"home defense\", PD, it's for \"Constitution defense\". For home defense I have a Saiga 12 gauge semi-auto shotgun, (another \"eeeeeeeeevil\" weapon B.O. plans to ban by name), and several 12 round magazines for it that can handle up to 3\" magnum slugs, buckshot etc. That one is my project gun. It's Russian, made by Izhmash just like currently produced AK's. It is about 85% identical to an AK.. the way the action, gas piston, safety lever works is all the same.. basically a 12 gauge AK. It is currently equipped with the \"sporting\" monte carlo stock that it has to be imported with, but I've got the parts ordered and on the way to replace the trigger group and move it forward, install a pistol grip where it should go, and install a skeletonized side-folding stock. Oh.. and a forward tri-rail system to mount a vertical foregrip and tac flashlight etc. I'll take a few pics of it and post em later tonight, so you can see what I'm talking about.",

When it comes to intermediate and long range work, I still am a firm believer that I can do a he11 of a lot more damage and chaos to a bad guy with my scoped .30-06 Remington 700 bolt action deer rifle than you could with a semi-auto AK/AK clone. Like LOA1 said, the AK round has a very high chance of going through your walls and into your neighbor's house - and if you accidentally kill your neighbor or one of his family members shooting at a burglar, it's you who's in deep chit with the law.", 
        "reply": " The SGL20's not necessarily for \"home defense\", PD, it's for \"Constitution defense\". For home defense I have a Saiga 12 gauge semi-auto shotgun, (another \"eeeeeeeeevil\" weapon B.O. plans to ban by name), and several 12 round magazines for it that can handle up to 3\" magnum slugs, buckshot etc. That one is my project gun. It's Russian, made by Izhmash just like currently produced AK's. It is about 85% identical to an AK.. the way the action, gas piston, safety lever works is all the same.. basically a 12 gauge AK. It is currently equipped with the \"sporting\" monte carlo stock that it has to be imported with, but I've got the parts ordered and on the way to replace the trigger group and move it forward, install a pistol grip where it should go, and install a skeletonized side-folding stock. Oh.. and a forward tri-rail system to mount a vertical foregrip and tac flashlight etc. I'll take a few pics of it and post em later tonight, so you can see what I'm talking about.",

I'll take their word on Iraqi shooting prowess, or lack thereof. Thanks for clarifying what you meant by a \"tricky\" mag release. I will agree that it can be more difficult to change mags out quickly with an AK, but anything can be done with practice. Since you were using old beat-up AK's and brand new M16's, the observations you made concerning their comparative accuracy, (at least at those short ranges), are pretty invalid. Apples and oranges. Your other points regarding the lighter weight of the M16 and its variants are valid, but there are tradeoffs either way. Sure the ammo's lighter.. the 5.56 round is smaller and less damaging. The AR vs AK argument has been raging for decades and there's really no need to rehash it here. They're different weapons and each has advantages and disadvantages. To each his own. I'd prefer a quality AK over an AR personally, more especially if the AK had selective fire, as it's supposed to. It really shines on full-auto, which is how it was designed to be primarily used. The safety/selector lever goes from safe, to full-auto, then to semi-auto. That tells you something.",

They also penetrate cover much better than 5.56's do. As for the magazine release being \"tricky\", I don't know how it could be any simpler. It's a hinged piece of steel.. how can anyone fack up its operation? Who was having trouble with it, the Iraqis or you or..? By looking at your profile it seems that you haven't served in Iraq, so how would you know how Iraqis can shoot. With the magazine release it is a simple operation, but because of its location does not make for as fast a reload in a tactical situation as the M-16. The M-16 is one smooth motion hit the magazine release with the firing and insert new magazine. Granted our AKs were old and had been used for years, and the M-16s were brand new so that accounts for some of the difference. However, the overall weight and balance of the M-16s is better. Personally I'll take an M-16 or especially an M-4 like I carried in Iraq due to weight and the weight of the ammunition. Also due to the length of the magazine the AK-47 is harder to fire from the prone.", 
        "reply": " That's right, I didn't serve in Iraq. I have two brothers who did. I'll take their word on Iraqi shooting prowess, or lack thereof. Thanks for clarifying what you meant by a \"tricky\" mag release. I will agree that it can be more difficult to change mags out quickly with an AK, but anything can be done with practice. Since you were using old beat-up AK's and brand new M16's, the observations you made concerning their comparative accuracy, (at least at those short ranges), are pretty invalid. Apples and oranges. Your other points regarding the lighter weight of the M16 and its variants are valid, but there are tradeoffs either way. Sure the ammo's lighter.. the 5.56 round is smaller and less damaging. The AR vs AK argument has been raging for decades and there's really no need to rehash it here. They're different weapons and each has advantages and disadvantages. To each his own. I'd prefer a quality AK over an AR personally, more especially if the AK had selective fire, as it's supposed to. It really shines on full-auto, which is how it was designed to be primarily used. The safety/selector lever goes from safe, to full-auto, then to semi-auto. That tells you something.",

I like the classic AK47 caliber, it's certainly proven itself for decades and it's big enough to hunt with. As for steel-cased ammo.. she eats it for breakfast and asks for more. These rifles are anything but picky about ammunition. If it's 7.62x39, it'll fire it with no malfunctions of any kind. The accuracy of a quality semi-auto AK like my SGL20 is <1 moa at 100 yards. Most AK's are capable of 1-2 moa at 100 yards, even the less expensive, more roughly finished ones like the Romanian AK clones. No AK can compete with the accuracy of that AR you built at that range, (~600 yards). They were never meant to. What they do is shrug off abuse and neglect that would destroy an AR and keep on firing, and lay down heavy fire within a few hundred yards, (the range in which they were meant to be used). Their max effective range is about 500 yards. Beyond that their bullets can be lethal of course, but if someone were hit with one at over ~550 yards it'd be due more to bad luck than deliberate intent of the shooter. You're even more into firearms than I am, Ira.. from what I can tell. I recommend that you pick up a quality semi-auto AK, I think you'd fall in love with her simplicity and effectiveness the first time you took her to the range, just as I did. Just don't expect her to be a sniper rifle and you won't be disappointed. just might have to do that, i recently built a legacy gun for my oldest grandson (to date he has done nothing to derserve it, so it sits in safe waiting) but i built it to shoot and shoot it does but like you said, and yes you piqued some interest in this, i also like the historical significance sometimes. i was wounded with a sks and actually had the rifle that did the job, however some desk raiding army captain tried to confiscate it at airport stating i could not get on airplane with the weapon, even though it had clearances up to and including god.. so instead of just handing it over to him i hit it on the concrete so hard i bent the receiver and broke stock , handed it to him and said \"here is your war souvenir\" and my first sgt punched me and threw me on the airplane and said \"get outta here before this idiot tries to lock your sorry ass up\" but that was a different time",
