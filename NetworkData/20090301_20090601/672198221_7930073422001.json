        "content": "Johnny Bolton's little world cop gambit designed to let somebody anywhere stop,search, declare contraband and impound any cargo 'deemed' to be vaguely relative to WMD's is at the root of Kim Jong Il's little bit of muscle flexing. More to the point South Korea's (backed by a US fleet) declared intent to be the PCI watch-dog in the area. PCI has yet to gain international recognition, read UN approval, although desire to trade into US ports has a number of nations signing away their rights to unencumbered transit of international waters. A sop to the Navy, long the ignored little brother of national security, PCI would provide a 'mission' not seen since the Royal Navy was stopping ships to press-gang english speakers or to look for african slaves. Not doubt Josemite told the Prez the 'Pro-life'eration Control Initiative was something to protect anti-abortionists. Too bad he couldn't sell it to the 'axles of eevul' or the general assembly.

Last time he acted out, President Obama comepltely ignored him, where other presidents sat down at the negotiating table and gave him at least some of what he wanted. We need to continue ignoring him. He's only a long term threat to us, but a short term threat to China due to refugee considerations in a case of war with the south, and China has a lot more leverage than we do. We need to stop doing China's job for them and let them handle their unruly toddler Il. Sometimes sending the Americans to rush headlong into the fray is not always the best answer, especially in Asia. If we force them to, the other Asian countries WILL deal with Kim, knowing they have our backing. Would you give your two-year old a cookie after he threw a major tantrum in the mall? I doubt it. Why, then, do we continually do that with North Korea?",

That would be moderated by the motivation, determination and ability of the PANK to reunite the Koreas by force. There is no developed ability to invade or otherwise discomfit Japan. An across-the-Yalu 'banzai' charge into China would be suicidal, with reciprocal consequeances. He might be able to transport a nuclear device by truck, or ambush some border guards with shovels, again .....but the rest is hoohah!",

This story broke several years ago. Due to maritime law, the Navy couldn't keep the ships in question, but had to permit them to keep going. I understand that PCI will likely cause a reaction by NK. But on the other hand, we can't just let them ship crazy things willy-nilly all over the planet. Consider it a blockade - that sort of thing's been done rather frequently since the Royal Navy was recruiting by force on the high seas.",
