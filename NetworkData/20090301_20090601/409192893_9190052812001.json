Kind of explains why Democrats would actually consider not cutting the DoD budget and why they are putting an end to stoploss. Why have a draft or stoploss if you can effectively increase the military by 30% by militarizing civilians. Wow, isn't that a novel idea? ---http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/140410p.pdf",

Read Below updated 8:44 p.m. ET March 18, 2009 WASHINGTON - Top aides to President Barack Obama are recommending that the United States combine a boost in military deployments with a steep increase in civilian experts to combat a growing insurgency in Afghanistan, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday. Several hundred civilians from various U.S. government agencies \u2014 from agronomists to economists and legal experts \u2014 will be deployed to Afghanistan to reinforce the nonmilitary component in Kabul and the existing provincial reconstruction teams in the countryside, officials said. A soon-to-be-concluded review of Afghanistan policy that Obama is expected to act on and announce next week builds on steps first endorsed by the Bush administration last year, the officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the review has not yet been completed.",
