If I remember the wording correctly...He's said many times that Afganistan is a \"just war\". So he's not blaming anyone for going there. 2. he(obama) is responsable for what happens there NOW. But past actions(or inactions) can and do have a bearing on what happens there now. 3. when you said \"if it gets ugly and I think it will, go back and blame it on the past administration as their war\" you're predicting what you THINK will happen. Yes if it \"gets ugly\" and he blames that only on Bush then he'ld be wrong. But thats not whats happening here.",

Obama made it clear he was going to focus on Afganistan and Pakistan and just like the administration before him, made a promise to hunt down Bin Laden, the real terror behind 9/11. He can't go back later and put being in Afganistan on Bush. He has to own that as his own. Or he should have ended it along with Iraq don't you think? PS..it has always bothered me that in 8 years the Bush people could not get Bin Laden. Something is just not right about that.

I believe you are correct regarding the courts. The CnC is not the final authority on this matter. I personally would prefer the photos were not released (at least while we have troops in-country). I do believe they should be sealed and safeguarded as evidence. I'd hate to see another blatant destruction of evidence like we did with the CIA interrogation videos.",

If I remember the wording correctly...He's said many times that Afganistan is a \"just war\". So he's not blaming anyone for going there. 2. he(obama) is responsable for what happens there NOW. But past actions(or inactions) can and do have a bearing on what happens there now. 3. when you said \"if it gets ugly and I think it will, go back and blame it on the past administration as their war\" you're predicting what you THINK will happen. Yes if it \"gets ugly\" and he blames that only on Bush then he'ld be wrong. But thats not whats happening here.",

He ran on ending Iraq saying it was wrong and made a big stand on bringing the troops home. Only they are not coming home, they are going to Afganistan. Obama made it clear he was going to focus on Afganistan and Pakistan and just like the administration before him, made a promise to hunt down Bin Laden, the real terror behind 9/11. He can't go back later and put being in Afganistan on Bush. He has to own that as his own. Or he should have ended it along with Iraq don't you think? PS..it has always bothered me that in 8 years the Bush people could not get Bin Laden. Something is just not right about that. You can find Saddam in a hole in the desert but not Bin Laden in 8 years? We new pretty much knew where Sadam was all the time! Osama in the mountains of Afghanistan is like a needle in a hay stack!",
