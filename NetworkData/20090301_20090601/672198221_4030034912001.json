Sure enough here it is... If your pizzed off about President Obama having the same protection as President Bush then you surly weren\u2019t too pleased with President Bush breaking the bank back in 07 on his trip to the AEPC conference. George Bush arrives in Sydney for APEC By Joe Hildebrand, Political Reporter September 04, 2007 10:24pm US President George W Bush and his 1000-strong entourage have touched down in Sydney, triggering the biggest security lockdown in the city's history. Amid howls of protest from a small band of demonstrators in the city, Air Force One arrived at Sydney Airport at 10.19pm in front of an international media throng. Security measures for the president's arrival and four-day visit are the toughest the city has ever seen. A strong police presence outnumbered and outflanked the 50-odd protesters at Railway Square, including known troublemakers on the State Government's \"excluded persons'' list. Sydneysiders have been warned to prepare for massive upheaval to transport and other services. The two major routes to Sydney Airport were the subject of a massive security operation from 8pm last night, causing major disruptions to other motorists. Mr Bush stepped from the plane unaccompanied. He walked down the stairs and was greeted by Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile, NSW Premier Morris Iemma and other dignitaries, including Australia's ambassador to the US, Denis Richardson. Shortly after Mr Bush was followed from the plane by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, swarm of Secret Servce agents, other personnel and press emerged from the rear of Air Force One. Mr Bush, who was wearing a light-grey suit and powder-blue tie, waved several times to the asssmebled media and security personnel. He then hopped into one of two black armour-plated limousines, which, with the president on-board, is known as Cadillac One. His vehicle left the tarmac in a convoy of no less than 40 vehicles, headed by two NSW police cars and including six ambulances and two paramedic motorcycles. The convoy has been given a green light run along Southern Cross Drive and the Eastern Distributor, up to Macquarie Street in the city and to the Intercontinental Hotel, where the president is staying in a seven-room suite. The O'Riordan Street route to the airport also had a heavy security presence as a precautionary measure and even as late as yesterday there were still rumours the president would be landing at Richmond air base. Accompanying the president was expected to be 150 national security advisers, 250 Secret Service agents, 200 public servants, 50 political aides, 15 sniffer dog teams and even five chefs. The presidential 747 was accompanied by a second identical stand-in plane and followed by a third jumbo jet carrying 150 White House journalists, medical staff, advisers, public servants, Secret Service agents, dogs and cooks. It is understood two or three transport planes carrying the presidential helicopter, Marine One, and dozens of motorcade vehicles including limousines, Secret Service wagons, VIP guest vans and an ambulance deployed in Sydney around two days ago to be ready for the president's arrival. The total 1,000-strong delegation is more than three times larger than any other country, including the 300-strong Australian team. Snip http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22365089-5006009,00.html What\u2019s changed since then? Oh, that\u2019s right, instead of an R designating the Presidents Political party it\u2019s been replace by a D. So it must be (at least according to you guys) that this President is not entitled to the same scope of protection as the ones with the R. It's also just my opinion that the hypocrisy that is evident in this thread knows no bounds.",

If your pizzed off about President Obama having the same protection as President Bush then you surly weren\u2019t too pleased with President Bush breaking the bank back in 07 on his trip to the AEPC conference. George Bush arrives in Sydney for APEC By Joe Hildebrand, Political Reporter September 04, 2007 10:24pm US President George W Bush and his 1000-strong entourage have touched down in Sydney, triggering the biggest security lockdown in the city's history. Amid howls of protest from a small band of demonstrators in the city, Air Force One arrived at Sydney Airport at 10.19pm in front of an international media throng. Security measures for the president's arrival and four-day visit are the toughest the city has ever seen. A strong police presence outnumbered and outflanked the 50-odd protesters at Railway Square, including known troublemakers on the State Government's \"excluded persons'' list. Sydneysiders have been warned to prepare for massive upheaval to transport and other services. The two major routes to Sydney Airport were the subject of a massive security operation from 8pm last night, causing major disruptions to other motorists. Mr Bush stepped from the plane unaccompanied. He walked down the stairs and was greeted by Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile, NSW Premier Morris Iemma and other dignitaries, including Australia's ambassador to the US, Denis Richardson. Shortly after Mr Bush was followed from the plane by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, swarm of Secret Servce agents, other personnel and press emerged from the rear of Air Force One. Mr Bush, who was wearing a light-grey suit and powder-blue tie, waved several times to the asssmebled media and security personnel. He then hopped into one of two black armour-plated limousines, which, with the president on-board, is known as Cadillac One. His vehicle left the tarmac in a convoy of no less than 40 vehicles, headed by two NSW police cars and including six ambulances and two paramedic motorcycles. The convoy has been given a green light run along Southern Cross Drive and the Eastern Distributor, up to Macquarie Street in the city and to the Intercontinental Hotel, where the president is staying in a seven-room suite. The O'Riordan Street route to the airport also had a heavy security presence as a precautionary measure and even as late as yesterday there were still rumours the president would be landing at Richmond air base. Accompanying the president was expected to be 150 national security advisers, 250 Secret Service agents, 200 public servants, 50 political aides, 15 sniffer dog teams and even five chefs. The presidential 747 was accompanied by a second identical stand-in plane and followed by a third jumbo jet carrying 150 White House journalists, medical staff, advisers, public servants, Secret Service agents, dogs and cooks. It is understood two or three transport planes carrying the presidential helicopter, Marine One, and dozens of motorcade vehicles including limousines, Secret Service wagons, VIP guest vans and an ambulance deployed in Sydney around two days ago to be ready for the president's arrival. The total 1,000-strong delegation is more than three times larger than any other country, including the 300-strong Australian team.

Oh, that\u2019s right, instead of an R designating the Presidents Political party it\u2019s been replace by a D. So it must be (at least according to you guys) that this President is not entitled to the same scope of protection as the ones with the R. It's also just my opinion that the hypocrisy that is evident in this thread knows no bounds.",
