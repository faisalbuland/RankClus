Gallo was arrested and will be charged with felony drunken driving, felony hit-and-run and three counts of vehicular manslaughter. Police said Gallo had a blood-alcohol level that was well above the legal limit at the time of the collision. According to the DMV, his license was suspended for DUI in December 2005, and in 2006, he was ticketed for not wearing a seatbelt, but not arrested for driving with a suspended license. In January 2007, he was cited for having an open container or marijuana in his vehicle, but not cited for having a suspended license. The minivan was reportedly speeding, but the exact speed was not determined. From ABC7 News LA",
