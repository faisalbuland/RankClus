He/she also should ask the client if the house they are moving to is aways off the main road and if there stairs. There is a charge for that. When we moved, we did not know how far the house was from the main road. the estimater did not ask us. The mover told us the estimater should have asked, since he didn't ask, there would be no charge. We leased the home sight unseen, since this was an interstate move. We communicated by phone with the home owner, we didn't ask if the home was not close to the main road, nor did we ask if there were steps. There were only two steps to the deck, but the mover charges extra anyway! Keep smiling, everyone will wonder what you've been up to!",
