It's against the law for anyone in the Army to prosylatize their religion. If this had been sponsored by the government, it would in fact be a violation of this law. Since in fact it WAS a private Church, there's nothing to accuse the government of, making this an academic discussion. This Church, unthinking fanatics that they are, were quite prepared to sacrifice any number of American lives to spread their propaganda. If we had acted as a gigantic armed missionary group, it would have totally and completely doomed our mission to Afghanistan. Absolutely insane move.
