The Iowa Supreme Court said a law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples violates the Iowa Constitution\u2019s equal-protection provisions. The justices said their decision would take effect three weeks from the date it was handed down, meaning same-sex couples will be able to marry in the Hawkeye State beginning April 24. The court also raised a religious argument. While the sanctity of marriage is very important to many religious believers, the justices said, neither the state nor federal government has any business sanctifying marriage.

Judging from the high divorce rate in this Country, the pomp & ceremony of holy matrimony performed in a religious setting doesn't mean squat to those who opt to have their short term marriages temporarily sanctified. Shoot, wedding gowns are now designed for Wash & Wear!! AND I think these gowns are even made to accept different dyes so the not-so-new bride can change colors with the season!!! A good old fashioned marriage thru a Justice of the Peace would be wise,,, they are much cheaper and the marriage will last just as long. Come to think of it, the money saved will offset the cost of those peppy Divorce Lawyers.",
