My husband was told by a VA doctor after going through tests that he has \"LOW MOTILITY\" in his sperm. Over the past few years we have met countless couples with the EXACT same diagnosis that are military vets from Persian Gulf. I am now collecting names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and signed statements from every vet I can find with this same diagnosis. If you have this diagnosis please contact me.",
