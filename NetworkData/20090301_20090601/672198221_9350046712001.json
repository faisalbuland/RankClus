The 70-year-old apologized for the many years he operated the $50 billion Ponzi scheme, saying he was \"deeply sorry and ashamed for my crimes,\" according to reports. He continued to say he is aware he hurt people and that the representations he made to his customers to trade securities were false. His sentencing is scheduled for June 16. The former Nasdaq chairman said he thought financial swindle would end quickly and that his trading and market-making operations were legitimate and that he felt compelled to meet client expectations. Through his plea, Madoff admitted to wire fraud, securities fraud, mail fraud, three counts of money laundering, perjury and a host of other charges. The disgraced financier could also be subject to mandatory restitution payments as well as fines. The government is claiming $170 billion in forfeiture. Presiding Judge Denny Chin will sentence Madoff at a later hearing, but could revoke his bail today, sending Madoff to jail. U.S. prosecutors say there is no plea agreement between the government and the man who ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history -- and that the investigation is continuing. Victims of the scheme were invited to speak at the trial.The first victim demanded Madoff look at the victims, but Madoff declined. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

It had to be a conspiracy with many involved and that money has to be someplace. Everyone involved with him should have thier tax returns Audited all the way back, and be made to account for thier assets. When your assets are more than your income you have some explaining to do. I recently tried to give my Daughter 50K to help her buy a home and avoid a tax on either end. So I made out so I made out 5 sep cks under 10K as gifts. She deposited them and that was not good enough for the bank they wanted proof where she got the extra 50K. she produced the cancelled checks from me along with a letter. Then they wanted to know where I got it and the account. And thats for only 50k and here this bum can move around 170 billion and no one questions it?",

The 70-year-old apologized for the many years he operated the $50 billion Ponzi scheme, saying he was \"deeply sorry and ashamed for my crimes,\" according to reports. He continued to say he is aware he hurt people and that the representations he made to his customers to trade securities were false. His sentencing is scheduled for June 16. The former Nasdaq chairman said he thought financial swindle would end quickly and that his trading and market-making operations were legitimate and that he felt compelled to meet client expectations. Through his plea, Madoff admitted to wire fraud, securities fraud, mail fraud, three counts of money laundering, perjury and a host of other charges. The disgraced financier could also be subject to mandatory restitution payments as well as fines. The government is claiming $170 billion in forfeiture. Presiding Judge Denny Chin will sentence Madoff at a later hearing, but could revoke his bail today, sending Madoff to jail. U.S. prosecutors say there is no plea agreement between the government and the man who ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history -- and that the investigation is continuing.
