You make a lot of interesting points here: 1) We atheists don't where our beliefs on our sleeves, hats, necklaces, or anywhere else visible. This is out of respect for regulations and for others. There's really nothing stopping us and we might just start. 2) Most traditional religious people do where their religion on crosses around their necks or other clothing. This is prohibited in the military, technically, just for uniformity. 3) The civilian has personal clothes on and is really not beholden to military regulations, so on the one hand maybe he did nothing wrong (unless he was actually a DA Civilian employee and then maybe). 4) The overt act of announcing one's beliefs in the workplace has an immediate disruptive effect. You, seeing that, felt out of place by having to hide your beliefs, felt it unfair that that person had privileges that you do not, and you might have been drawn into a debate about religion. He is declaring his Christianity and maybe you want to declare your beliefs. You might do this for no other reason that to avoid being lumped in with Christianity. This 'lumping' and 'assumption of conformity' and 'silence is agreement' mentality leads to total fairytales like the idea that the military is 90% Christian as is sometimes suggested. Then people think it's ok by virtue of supermajority to ignore others and heap special privileges on the supposed majority. Unless we want to instigate intractable arguments about belief and cause one or more groups of individuals to feel persecuted, everyone needs to focus on work and keep their personal agenda to themselves (and not advertise it overtly).

Atheist is an option on the list and you can get privately made dogtags at many outlets. has a list of regs including AR 680-29 that has religion codes. Some ones to consider are - 00 - blank 74 - other 99 - unknown 75 - atheist So yes. It's possible as long as the clerk does their job properly. This message has been edited.

        "quote": "Originally posted by 19493977: I am aware of the religious freedoms in the United States Military, but this seems to be an issue when it comes to your dog tags. My brother and I are both atheist, he is a Marine and I am enlisting with the Army next wednesday. His tags state \"no preference\", even though he clearly stated atheist as his preference. It is of my understanding that \"IF\" this soldier were to die in combat he would receive a christian ceremony. My question is, is it possible to receive tags that state Atheist, and if not, why? While I have no problem with any religious affiliation, I myself would not want to receive a Christian ceremony upon death. Any information on this subject would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.",

You make a lot of interesting points here: 1) We atheists don't where our beliefs on our sleeves, hats, necklaces, or anywhere else visible. This is out of respect for regulations and for others. There's really nothing stopping us and we might just start. 2) Most traditional religious people do where their religion on crosses around their necks or other clothing. This is prohibited in the military, technically, just for uniformity. 3) The civilian has personal clothes on and is really not beholden to military regulations, so on the one hand maybe he did nothing wrong (unless he was actually a DA Civilian employee and then maybe). 4) The overt act of announcing one's beliefs in the workplace has an immediate disruptive effect. You, seeing that, felt out of place by having to hide your beliefs, felt it unfair that that person had privileges that you do not, and you might have been drawn into a debate about religion. He is declaring his Christianity and maybe you want to declare your beliefs. You might do this for no other reason that to avoid being lumped in with Christianity. This 'lumping' and 'assumption of conformity' and 'silence is agreement' mentality leads to total fairytales like the idea that the military is 90% Christian as is sometimes suggested. Then people think it's ok by virtue of supermajority to ignore others and heap special privileges on the supposed majority. Unless we want to instigate intractable arguments about belief and cause one or more groups of individuals to feel persecuted, everyone needs to focus on work and keep their personal agenda to themselves (and not advertise it overtly).
