Cha-ching!!! Yes that really is a stupid idea. Americans don't need to working at getting in better shape and being healthier. Americans have the God given right to gorge on crappy fast food, clog their arteries and croak years before their time. Getting into better shape and living a longer healthier life is, in your own words, \"A joke.\" There is nothing more heart warming then seeing a bunch of fat, flabby Americans huffing and puffing after climbing a flight of stairs. Bike riding defiantly needs to be verboten. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",
