When the economy slumps, so does tax revenue, and this recession has been no different, says Kerry Lynch, senior fellow at the AIER and author of the study. \"It illustrates how severe the recession has been.\" For example, 6 million people lost jobs in the 12 months ended in April \u2014 and that means far fewer dollars from income taxes. Income tax revenue dropped 44% from a year ago. \"These are staggering numbers,\" Lynch says.

He doesn't know the first damn thing about business nor does any of the noodle-heads working for him... they all know how to evade taxes though... I wonder if they'll close any of those LOOPHOLES..?",
