(as evidenced by his extra 12 billion dollars found in his bank) he not only defrauded his peole, he defraudsed japanese investors and aid workers. as far as his death squads, \"Grupo Colina\", they were his armed forces, operating under his direct control, and thus he is responsible for any and all actions they commited remember... you can always delegate authority, but you can NEVER delegate responsability. his Auto Golpe was a measured act desighned to gain authoritative power over his people, and he exersized that authority with sanctions against the press.. under his rule freedom of press became threatened. Universities were redistributed to HIS pocket. he was so dangerous in the area, that Peru was ostracized form the OAS, and CHILE, ARGENTINA, and ECUADOR pulled their Ambassadors out... How about the detention and disappearance of the 67 students from Huancayo, and the disappearance of the residents from Chimbote? they all have names, and are all still missing... he has been found guilty and will spend the next 25 years in prison, ON TOP of his 6 years he was convicted to for corruption charges.",
