Sales of the vehicles have plummeted by 40% in the US this year. Deripaska, who is worth an estimated \u00a314bn, made his fortune in aluminium and recently purchased a stake in Magna International, a Canadian car parts manufacturer. He is thought to be keen to get Magna involved in making Hummers. A GM spokeswoman declined to comment on the discussions, saying only: \"We are working through the process of a strategic review of Hummer.\" (....)
