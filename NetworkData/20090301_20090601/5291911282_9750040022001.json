        "content": "If you want to become an officer in the Reserves, here's how to do it: Talk to the ROTC people on the college campus where you'd like to finish up your bachelor's. Ask about the ROTC/Reserves program called the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP). Ask about doing Basic Camp, then entering ROTC as a junior in college and an MSIII (third-year cadet). You could potentially get a scholarship, PLUS you'd be assigned to a Reserve unit as a cadet (officer intern, essentially) while you finish your bachelor's degree. You'd get a living stipend in addition to your scholarship. OR you could just up and enlist, and then talk to your college's ROTC program about going enlisted-to-officer via the SMP. It would be a bit tougher, because you'd actually have to go through the full enlistment process before you'd even be considered an officer candidate, but you'd get a lot more respect for it. You could also go DIRECTLY into your third year of being a cadet (MSIII) if you've already been enlisted. That gives you two years as a cadet, which means two years of scholarship time, and if you've already got an associate's degree, the timing matches perfectly. If you're going to do it, and you've got the 'nads, enlist first. Tougher training, better training. That way, you'd also get an MOS - pick something that might relate to your civilian career if possible - which will give you a greater knowledge base as an officer. You'll also get the GI Bill and (possibly) the kicker bonus on top of the living stipend, PLUS your drill pay during your two years. It adds up. BUT... Don't do it unless you REALLY want to serve, you WANT to get dirty, you WANT to give up your weekends and spare time, you WANT to keep yourself in good physical fitness, and you're ready to go to war at any time. Yeah, benefits are great, and they're a nice perk, but don't do this if you just want a uniform to impress the girls and extra cash for college. Be ready for the political BS that accompanies enlistment, and be aware that it gets worse as an officer. If you're ready to put your country before your personal liberties, then enlist. If you're ready to put the well-being of every troop under your command ahead of your own comfort and leisure, then go for a commission. Now, go look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself what you really want.",
