Notice the cop charges in, feet first, kicking the girl in the stomach instantly followed by a closed fist into the face before grabbing her by the hair, using the fistful of hair to slam her head-first into the concrete wall - then that same handful of hair to throw her facefirst into the concrete cell floor - followed by two closed fisted punches to the back of the girl's head. Once they had her face down, she was lifted up BY THE HAIR and drug out of the cell! In case you didn't know, the girl in question is only 15 - and the cop is 31, - more than twice her age, and has at least 80lbs of weight over her. How many of y'all here have a 15 year old? Quite a few of ya I would figure. How many 15 year olds have a temper or smart mouth, especially when they get in trouble or mad? Just think - that could be YOUR KID that this cop threw around like that. That's why cops like that have to be kicked off the force and sent to prison - to make an example out of them, so other cops don't make the same mistake. This message has been edited.

Once they had her face down, she was lifted up BY THE HAIR and drug out of the cell! In case you didn't know, the girl in question is only 15 - and the cop is 31, - more than twice her age, and has at least 80lbs of weight over her. How many of y'all here have a 15 year old? Quite a few of ya I would figure. How many 15 year olds have a temper or smart mouth, especially when they get in trouble or mad? Just think - that could be YOUR KID that this cop threw around like that. That's why cops like that have to be kicked off the force and sent to prison - to make an example out of them, so other cops don't make the same mistake. This message has been edited.

Once they had her face down, she was lifted up BY THE HAIR and drug out of the cell! In case you didn't know, the girl in question is only 15 - and the cop is 31, - more than twice her age, and has at least 80lbs of weight over her. How many of y'all here have a 15 year old? Quite a few of ya I would figure. How many 15 year olds have a temper or smart mouth, especially when they get in trouble or mad? Just think - that could be YOUR KID that this cop threw around like that. That's why cops like that have to be kicked off the force and sent to prison - to make an example out of them, so other cops don't make the same mistake. This message has been edited.

No doubt in my mind, this disgrace to police everywhere needs to spend the next few years in prison - where some big hairy convict can bend him over and make him squeal like a pig every day. What's worse is that the cop had a trainee with him at the time - what's this trainee to think? Will he get the impression that this is ok or justified somehow?",

Notice the cop charges in, feet first, kicking the girl in the stomach instantly followed by a closed fist into the face before grabbing her by the hair, using the fistful of hair to slam her head-first into the concrete wall - then that same handful of hair to throw her facefirst into the concrete cell floor - followed by two closed fisted punches to the back of the girl's head. Once they had her face down, she was lifted up BY THE HAIR and drug out of the cell! In case you didn't know, the girl in question is only 15 - and the cop is 31, - more than twice her age, and has at least 80lbs of weight over her. How many of y'all here have a 15 year old? Quite a few of ya I would figure. How many 15 year olds have a temper or smart mouth, especially when they get in trouble or mad? Just think - that could be YOUR KID that this cop threw around like that. That's why cops like that have to be kicked off the force and sent to prison - to make an example out of them, so other cops don't make the same mistake. This message has been edited.

Sounds like you guys took a page from the Federal Prosecutor that sent the border patrol guys to jail for shooting a drug dealer in his butt.", 
        "reply": " I like how a little girl gets beaten by the cops and everyone automatically assumes it was her fault. I'll agree that a video with no sound doesn't prove the officers acted improperly...but the video itself is pretty damning. Whatever the girl did, she didn't deserve this. If she ****ed the cops off, well, so what? I can go to jail for attacking someone who calls me a few nasty names; cops are supposed to be above this. Otherwise, what's the point?",

The girl could have easily suffered a fractured skull (from being head slammed into the concrete wall or floor), a broken neck (from being flung from the wall to the floor by the hair - if you watch the video in slow motion, her feet actually come up off of the ground before she is flung down onto the concrete), and/or broken ribs from being slammed down onto the floor. No doubt in my mind, this disgrace to police everywhere needs to spend the next few years in prison - where some big hairy convict can bend him over and make him squeal like a pig every day.
