If one of my Marines said, \"Sgt. you suck and you're demotivating everybody. I could do a lot better at motivating the shop than you can,\" They can stand the fark by for an arse chewing. But, if they asked to speak with me in my office and then said, \"Sgt. we completed the task you asked us to do, but I think it would make us work a lot harder if you gave us a few motovating words when we do a good job so we know when we're doing right, not just when we screw up,\" I would tell that devil dog I appreciate the concern for shop morale and I would think about incorporating his idea into the way I run the shop. I may or may not actually do what he wants, but I wouldn't write him up for disrespect either. I may even be pyssed that he had the nerve to question me, but in the end at least he will feel better cause he said something. Plus, you can always request mast if you think the Sgt. sucks so bad.

But, if they asked to speak with me in my office and then said, \"Sgt. we completed the task you asked us to do, but I think it would make us work a lot harder if you gave us a few motovating words when we do a good job so we know when we're doing right, not just when we screw up,\" I would tell that devil dog I appreciate the concern for shop morale and I would think about incorporating his idea into the way I run the shop. I may or may not actually do what he wants, but I wouldn't write him up for disrespect either. I may even be pyssed that he had the nerve to question me, but in the end at least he will feel better cause he said something. Plus, you can always request mast if you think the Sgt. sucks so bad.

There are ways to address a problem with TACT. If one of my Marines said, \"Sgt. you suck and you're demotivating everybody. I could do a lot better at motivating the shop than you can,\" They can stand the fark by for an arse chewing. But, if they asked to speak with me in my office and then said, \"Sgt. we completed the task you asked us to do, but I think it would make us work a lot harder if you gave us a few motovating words when we do a good job so we know when we're doing right, not just when we screw up,\" I would tell that devil dog I appreciate the concern for shop morale and I would think about incorporating his idea into the way I run the shop. I may or may not actually do what he wants, but I wouldn't write him up for disrespect either. I may even be pyssed that he had the nerve to question me, but in the end at least he will feel better cause he said something. Plus, you can always request mast if you think the Sgt. sucks so bad.
