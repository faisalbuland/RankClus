The way it reads I will be moving my family to Eglin then going to phase 1 in Redstone. Does anyone know if the PCS to Eglin is prior to phase 1 or after phase 1? I'm currently SPC(P). The BEAR program is accepting PFC - SPC(P). Once I get to AIT can I get promoted without issue or do I have to wait until after AIT to keep my BEAR bonus? I'm currently deployed and won't retun home until Sep this year. I start AIT for 89D in December. I'll have a small amount of time to get this worked out. Any help is greatly appreciated.",
