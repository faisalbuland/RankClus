I'm actually disappointed that the crewmember re-took their ship back- they shoulda stay prisoners so they could lead US back to the mothership. Too bad we can't do like they did in the film 'Hitman'- surgically implant a few pounds of C-4 in their bodies and detonate it when those pirates rejoin their group on the mothership, or at least implant a transmitter so they can lead us to their leaders.

No media present. General P is sending two more ships into the area. So what are we waiting for? An FBI negotiator to talk to them. My God have we lost our will to fight? I'm very glad I'm retired now because I couldn't stand to wear a uniform in today's military. Not with all this PC going around. Ummm, nope. We gotta capture these pirates and shower them with the gifts of freedom so they'll go back to their buddies and tell them what a swell bunch those American are and they'll quit messing with us. I'm actually disappointed that the crewmember re-took their ship back- they shoulda stay prisoners so they could lead US back to the mothership. Too bad we can't do like they did in the film 'Hitman'- surgically implant a few pounds of C-4 in their bodies and detonate it when those pirates rejoin their group on the mothership, or at least implant a transmitter so they can lead us to their leaders. You DO know we can't torture them for info, right ?",
