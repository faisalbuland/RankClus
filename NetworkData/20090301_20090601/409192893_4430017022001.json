I think it is unacceptable when a doctor or pharmacist (a) refuses to provide a service and (b) actively works to obstruct the patient from receiving that service. This has happened frequently where the pharmacist has refused to dispense birth control but has also refused to return the prescription so that it could be filled elsewhere. If someone had a situation where the moral opinions of the provider were in conflict with the urgent medical needs of the patient, that could also cause a problem, but I am personally unaware of any such circumstances.
