Hubby's in Iraq and I needed to buy a reliable little car with our tax return, in late January. I found a 1999 Ford Contour and it was a clean, one owner car that ran great when I test drove it. (I will now admit that I'm a total girl and know squat about buying cars!) Not 3 days later the Check Engine light was on, I noticed a sudden racket in the wheel well (Struts) and there was oil leaking on the ground, and a horrible exhaust smell. ALL AT ONCE! The Dealer said he'd send someone to get the car, which he did (leaving me a nasty & worse running Loaner car). He brought it back 3 days later with the Check Engine light STILL on, and nothing changed on the car whatsoever. I called the Mgr. of the place and said I wanted my money back or them to fix the more major issues or I was calling JAG and a Lawyer. He said \"What'd you expect? A new car, honey?! I ain't fixing nothin!\" and now he won't even talk to me. WTH?! They get to just sucker me and walk away laughing?! I've only had this car 2 months and I've spent 2/3 of that time having it sit in my garage because it barely runs! I had it inspected, and it needs so much stuff done that the total estimate repair costs are 50% MORE than the cars Book Value!! Can I involve the Military at all? Can I get them to take this POS back?! North Carolina (where I am/bought it) Lemon Law is sketchy on used cars, from what I've found.",

Good luck.\" After that I called the local VFW and left a message about it. I called Raleigh's Channel 5 On Your Side department. I filed an online complaint with the BBB. I also filled out a form for a Lemon Law/Consumer Affairs lawyer there in the area, with a 24 hour expected callback. What else?! I'm fired up now! LOL Oh, and as for Bruno....I think I got this, but ya know I DO have this ex.....",

They have funds to help families of Soldiers (Unmet Needs, Adopt a Soldier, etc. They can also at Post level help you with getting a reliable car. 2nd, contact the local media -TV is the best, but newspaper and local radio can also help. They have reporters that would eat this up along with getting the information off to the public as well as to 'caring citizens'. 3rd is BBB and local consumer advocate. Sounds like dealer was getting past the time limit on return and might also have actually defrauded you in the purchase. Soldiers & Sailors Relief Act probably won't help much as it sounds like you paid cash for the 'Lemon' but the VFW Service Officer might be able to be your advocate. For ALL Families and those in the Military find the local VFW or AL Service Officer. They have ways to help but the main reason is not to go it alone; you are frustrated and have enough important things to worry about without some jerk taking advantage of you or your situation! God Bless your Hubby and you! and thank you for helping keep my family safe!",
