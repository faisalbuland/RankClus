        "reply": "The leaders of the Soviet Union were not conservative in the sense that they believe in a free market, etc. They were conservative in the sense that they were distrustful of change, and valued the status quo. What Gorbachev, who was much more conservative than people think, realized and expressed was that the status quo was no longer possible. He did not expect, nor want, the revolution that happened. He wanted to reform what already existed in order to allow the soviet state to continue. Reagan, while probably the best president of our lifetimes, was most certainly not the best president in our nation's history. George Washington created the presidency through sheer personality and discretion, making himself \"first citizen\" and preventing the executive from falling into something akin to monarchy, which many citizens in his time actually wanted.",

Well said, Bleah. Washington could have been a king. He believed in this nation's founding ideals far too much to seize the authoritarian power he could have had. I also think that Reagan was the greatest president of the latter 20th century, by far. I hope that he's not the greatest president I'll see in my lifetime, but it's starting to look that way, judging from our current president and the last few men who have held that office.",
