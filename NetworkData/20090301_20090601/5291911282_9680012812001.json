Statistically you most likely won't stay in the Guard long enough to qualify for any retirement monies. Also, statistically you won't be married to the same gal either. So, IMHO, don't worry about it at this time in space. One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

As for your retirement, if you live long enough to get there, you are given one of several choices. The first is that you get 100% of your retirement at age 60, but if you die, all retirement stops, even if your wife is still alive. Another is that you take 50% of your retirement, but if you die, your wife continues to get 50%. I would assume, if you opt for the first one and die before you are 60, neither you nor your wife would ever get a dime, but if you went for the second choice, your wife would start drawing 50% when you would have reached 60. I have opted for the 50% option and will be 60 in a year, so I'm hoping Obama and the Democrats don't figure out how to screw me out of that first check - - Wandering and Wondering",
