I was diagnosed with a brain tumor in Oct 2008. I have no family history of tumors or cancer. I believe it is related to all the different types of vaccinations we all received prior to going and after we returned from the Gulf War. Myself and other soldiers also were infected with bacterias from over there that nearly rotted our feet off. I don't receive compensation for the brain tumor nor the bacteria infection I sustained on my feet, and am looking for any other Veterans with similiar conditions.......Calvin King CPL USMC",

I'm sorry for your troubles and I hope you find help and support from your brothers. But consider for a moment, that if your experience has had such a telling effect on you, who was at least 'supposedly' protected from the effects, what must it be like for innocents caught on the sharp end, with no protection and less support than you had, or have now. That hippie thing about war being 'no good for children and other living things' is all too sadly true.",
