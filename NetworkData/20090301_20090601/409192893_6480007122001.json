Ah, but the plot thickens. On May 3, 2007, Iraqi Interior Ministry said that al-Baghdadi was killed by American and Iraqi forces. Ok, maybe now we get some closure. Nope! Two months later in July, the Pentagon tells us that al-Baghdadi never actually existed. That he was a fictional character all along. Now, I must tell you that I thought that was crazy at the time.
