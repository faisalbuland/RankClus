It's just that violence has dropped enough there, and gone up enough in Afghanistan that Iraq is now the safer locale. Go figure. Mail issues are common. ESPECIALLY if she is at a remote base. If you are on a main base, and everything is in place, you will get most mail within 14 days. Amazon.com can get stuff to Kirkuk, Iraq inside of seven days, though nine is the norm. Remote bases have issues, they only get mail when they get convoys, and when convoy space is available. Also, to be honest, there are some packages that just disappear. Not sure where they end up... If you're going to send expensive or good things, spread them out over several packages, and accept the fact that it's possible a couple of them won't ever get through. This message has been edited.

It's just that violence has dropped enough there, and gone up enough in Afghanistan that Iraq is now the safer locale. Go figure. Mail issues are common. ESPECIALLY if she is at a remote base. If you are on a main base, and everything is in place, you will get most mail within 14 days. Amazon.com can get stuff to Kirkuk, Iraq inside of seven days, though nine is the norm. Remote bases have issues, they only get mail when they get convoys, and when convoy space is available. Also, to be honest, there are some packages that just disappear. Not sure where they end up... If you're going to send expensive or good things, spread them out over several packages, and accept the fact that it's possible a couple of them won't ever get through. This message has been edited.
