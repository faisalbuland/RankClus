Though the party is a coalition of left-wing groups, it's dominated by the Communist Party. Good for them. They abandoned violent revolution for the promise of free elections. Now they won one. The Sandinistas have also been Democratically elected - Twice. They lost an election and bowed to the will of the majority. You have a problem with that? If you note from your link, the Communists were just one group in a coalition. As long as they respect Democracy - I don't have a problem. If they become a dictatorship, that's another matter.
