Authored by Congressman Nathan Deal (R-GA) and co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 46 other Members of the House of Representatives, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 (H.R.1868) would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to change the current interpretation of federal law that automatically confers citizenship to any child born in the United States regardless of the immigration status of the child's parents. (See H.R. 1868 Legislative Text and Co-sponsor Listing). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 has received increasing attention in the media.<edit>. (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009; '11Alive.com', May 26, 2009; WRBL, May 27, 2009). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 does not seek to amend the Constitution, but would instead amend a statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to clarify the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. Congressman Deal's bill would limit birthright citizenship only to children born to at least one parent who is either: (1) a citizen or national of the United States; (2) a lawful permanent resident; or (3) actively serving in the U.S. military. The legislation would only apply prospectively and would not \"affect the citizenship or nationality status of any person born before the date of the [bill's] enactment.\" (H.R.1868, April 2, 2009). Congressman Deal noted that the United States is one of only a few industrialized countries who still allow birthright citizenship. While stating he was skeptical about the bill's chances of passage, he said, \"I think it's important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\" (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009). AP.'http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/05/25/citizenship_bill.html' U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, has proposed changing the long-standing federal policy that automatically grants citizenship to any baby born on U.S. soil, a move opposed by immigrant rights advocates. Supporters of Deal\u2019s proposal say \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d encourages illegal immigration and makes enforcement of immigration laws more difficult. Opponents say the proposed law wouldn\u2019t solve the illegal immigration problem and goes against this country\u2019s traditions of welcoming immigrants. Recent headlines: <edit> Automatic citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d That provision, ratified in 1868, was drafted with freed slaves in mind. Deal and his supporters say the 14th Amendment wording was never meant to automatically give citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants. \u201cThis is a sensible, overdue measure that closes a clause that was never meant to be a loophole,\u201d said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks tighter immigration restrictions. Under Deal\u2019s proposal, babies born in the U.S. would automatically have citizenship only if at least one of their parents is a U.S. citizen or national, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., or actively serving in the U.S. military. Azadeh Shahshahani, director of the Immigrants Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, said the proposed law \u201cis not cognizant with the American spirit.\u201d \u201cWe would stand in strong opposition to this bill as it\u2019s in fundamental contradiction to our nation\u2019s long history of welcoming immigrants and bestowing inalienable rights\u201d on all people born here, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, she said. Supporters of the bill say automatic citizenship provides an incentive for women to risk coming to the country illegally. They call U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants \u201canchor babies\u201d because, when they become adults, the children can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residency. \u201cComing into the country for the express purpose of having a child in order to anchor that child and yourself is, in effect, gaming the system,\u201d Dane said. Lisa Navarrete, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said the proposed law wouldn\u2019t stem illegal immigration and would make the problem worse because not only would illegal immigrants be undocumented, their American-born children would be too. \u201cThe worst part of it is you end up with potentially millions of children who are stateless, who were born here and have no ties to any other country, yet they\u2019re not considered citizens or part of the United States,\u201d she said. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the policy of granting automatic citizenship to people born here is \u201cout of sync with the modern world.\u201d He and Deal said that the U.S. is one of the few wealthy industrialized nations that still allows birthright citizenship. Deal, who has submitted his bill to the House Judiciary Committee, said he\u2019s not optimistic about it becoming law this year unless it is tacked onto another bill. \u201cI think the current makeup of the Congress is such that this will never get a hearing and will never be an issue that we get a chance to vote on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\u201d",

Authored by Congressman Nathan Deal (R-GA) and co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 46 other Members of the House of Representatives, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 (H.R.1868) would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to change the current interpretation of federal law that automatically confers citizenship to any child born in the United States regardless of the immigration status of the child's parents. (See H.R. 1868 Legislative Text and Co-sponsor Listing). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 has received increasing attention in the media.<edit>. (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009; '11Alive.com', May 26, 2009; WRBL, May 27, 2009). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 does not seek to amend the Constitution, but would instead amend a statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to clarify the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. Congressman Deal's bill would limit birthright citizenship only to children born to at least one parent who is either: (1) a citizen or national of the United States; (2) a lawful permanent resident; or (3) actively serving in the U.S. military. The legislation would only apply prospectively and would not \"affect the citizenship or nationality status of any person born before the date of the [bill's] enactment.\" (H.R.1868, April 2, 2009). Congressman Deal noted that the United States is one of only a few industrialized countries who still allow birthright citizenship. While stating he was skeptical about the bill's chances of passage, he said, \"I think it's important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\" (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009). AP.'http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/05/25/citizenship_bill.html' U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, has proposed changing the long-standing federal policy that automatically grants citizenship to any baby born on U.S. soil, a move opposed by immigrant rights advocates. Supporters of Deal\u2019s proposal say \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d encourages illegal immigration and makes enforcement of immigration laws more difficult. Opponents say the proposed law wouldn\u2019t solve the illegal immigration problem and goes against this country\u2019s traditions of welcoming immigrants. Recent headlines: <edit> Automatic citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d That provision, ratified in 1868, was drafted with freed slaves in mind. Deal and his supporters say the 14th Amendment wording was never meant to automatically give citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants. \u201cThis is a sensible, overdue measure that closes a clause that was never meant to be a loophole,\u201d said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks tighter immigration restrictions. Under Deal\u2019s proposal, babies born in the U.S. would automatically have citizenship only if at least one of their parents is a U.S. citizen or national, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., or actively serving in the U.S. military. Azadeh Shahshahani, director of the Immigrants Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, said the proposed law \u201cis not cognizant with the American spirit.\u201d \u201cWe would stand in strong opposition to this bill as it\u2019s in fundamental contradiction to our nation\u2019s long history of welcoming immigrants and bestowing inalienable rights\u201d on all people born here, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, she said. Supporters of the bill say automatic citizenship provides an incentive for women to risk coming to the country illegally. They call U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants \u201canchor babies\u201d because, when they become adults, the children can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residency. \u201cComing into the country for the express purpose of having a child in order to anchor that child and yourself is, in effect, gaming the system,\u201d Dane said. Lisa Navarrete, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said the proposed law wouldn\u2019t stem illegal immigration and would make the problem worse because not only would illegal immigrants be undocumented, their American-born children would be too. \u201cThe worst part of it is you end up with potentially millions of children who are stateless, who were born here and have no ties to any other country, yet they\u2019re not considered citizens or part of the United States,\u201d she said. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the policy of granting automatic citizenship to people born here is \u201cout of sync with the modern world.\u201d He and Deal said that the U.S. is one of the few wealthy industrialized nations that still allows birthright citizenship. Deal, who has submitted his bill to the House Judiciary Committee, said he\u2019s not optimistic about it becoming law this year unless it is tacked onto another bill. \u201cI think the current makeup of the Congress is such that this will never get a hearing and will never be an issue that we get a chance to vote on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\u201d",

Authored by Congressman Nathan Deal (R-GA) and co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 46 other Members of the House of Representatives, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 (H.R.1868) would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to change the current interpretation of federal law that automatically confers citizenship to any child born in the United States regardless of the immigration status of the child's parents. (See H.R. 1868 Legislative Text and Co-sponsor Listing). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 has received increasing attention in the media.<edit>. (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009; '11Alive.com', May 26, 2009; WRBL, May 27, 2009). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 does not seek to amend the Constitution, but would instead amend a statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to clarify the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. Congressman Deal's bill would limit birthright citizenship only to children born to at least one parent who is either: (1) a citizen or national of the United States; (2) a lawful permanent resident; or (3) actively serving in the U.S. military. The legislation would only apply prospectively and would not \"affect the citizenship or nationality status of any person born before the date of the [bill's] enactment.\" (H.R.1868, April 2, 2009). Congressman Deal noted that the United States is one of only a few industrialized countries who still allow birthright citizenship. While stating he was skeptical about the bill's chances of passage, he said, \"I think it's important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\" (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009). AP.'http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/05/25/citizenship_bill.html' U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, has proposed changing the long-standing federal policy that automatically grants citizenship to any baby born on U.S. soil, a move opposed by immigrant rights advocates. Supporters of Deal\u2019s proposal say \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d encourages illegal immigration and makes enforcement of immigration laws more difficult. Opponents say the proposed law wouldn\u2019t solve the illegal immigration problem and goes against this country\u2019s traditions of welcoming immigrants. Recent headlines: <edit> Automatic citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d That provision, ratified in 1868, was drafted with freed slaves in mind. Deal and his supporters say the 14th Amendment wording was never meant to automatically give citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants. \u201cThis is a sensible, overdue measure that closes a clause that was never meant to be a loophole,\u201d said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks tighter immigration restrictions. Under Deal\u2019s proposal, babies born in the U.S. would automatically have citizenship only if at least one of their parents is a U.S. citizen or national, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., or actively serving in the U.S. military. Azadeh Shahshahani, director of the Immigrants Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, said the proposed law \u201cis not cognizant with the American spirit.\u201d \u201cWe would stand in strong opposition to this bill as it\u2019s in fundamental contradiction to our nation\u2019s long history of welcoming immigrants and bestowing inalienable rights\u201d on all people born here, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, she said. Supporters of the bill say automatic citizenship provides an incentive for women to risk coming to the country illegally. They call U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants \u201canchor babies\u201d because, when they become adults, the children can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residency. \u201cComing into the country for the express purpose of having a child in order to anchor that child and yourself is, in effect, gaming the system,\u201d Dane said. Lisa Navarrete, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said the proposed law wouldn\u2019t stem illegal immigration and would make the problem worse because not only would illegal immigrants be undocumented, their American-born children would be too. \u201cThe worst part of it is you end up with potentially millions of children who are stateless, who were born here and have no ties to any other country, yet they\u2019re not considered citizens or part of the United States,\u201d she said. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the policy of granting automatic citizenship to people born here is \u201cout of sync with the modern world.\u201d He and Deal said that the U.S. is one of the few wealthy industrialized nations that still allows birthright citizenship. Deal, who has submitted his bill to the House Judiciary Committee, said he\u2019s not optimistic about it becoming law this year unless it is tacked onto another bill. \u201cI think the current makeup of the Congress is such that this will never get a hearing and will never be an issue that we get a chance to vote on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\u201d",

Authored by Congressman Nathan Deal (R-GA) and co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 46 other Members of the House of Representatives, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 (H.R.1868) would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to change the current interpretation of federal law that automatically confers citizenship to any child born in the United States regardless of the immigration status of the child's parents. (See H.R. 1868 Legislative Text and Co-sponsor Listing). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 has received increasing attention in the media.<edit>. (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009; '11Alive.com', May 26, 2009; WRBL, May 27, 2009). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 does not seek to amend the Constitution, but would instead amend a statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to clarify the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. Congressman Deal's bill would limit birthright citizenship only to children born to at least one parent who is either: (1) a citizen or national of the United States; (2) a lawful permanent resident; or (3) actively serving in the U.S. military. The legislation would only apply prospectively and would not \"affect the citizenship or nationality status of any person born before the date of the [bill's] enactment.\" (H.R.1868, April 2, 2009). Congressman Deal noted that the United States is one of only a few industrialized countries who still allow birthright citizenship. While stating he was skeptical about the bill's chances of passage, he said, \"I think it's important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\" (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009). AP.'http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/05/25/citizenship_bill.html' U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, has proposed changing the long-standing federal policy that automatically grants citizenship to any baby born on U.S. soil, a move opposed by immigrant rights advocates. Supporters of Deal\u2019s proposal say \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d encourages illegal immigration and makes enforcement of immigration laws more difficult. Opponents say the proposed law wouldn\u2019t solve the illegal immigration problem and goes against this country\u2019s traditions of welcoming immigrants. Recent headlines: <edit> Automatic citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d That provision, ratified in 1868, was drafted with freed slaves in mind. Deal and his supporters say the 14th Amendment wording was never meant to automatically give citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants. \u201cThis is a sensible, overdue measure that closes a clause that was never meant to be a loophole,\u201d said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks tighter immigration restrictions. Under Deal\u2019s proposal, babies born in the U.S. would automatically have citizenship only if at least one of their parents is a U.S. citizen or national, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., or actively serving in the U.S. military. Azadeh Shahshahani, director of the Immigrants Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, said the proposed law \u201cis not cognizant with the American spirit.\u201d \u201cWe would stand in strong opposition to this bill as it\u2019s in fundamental contradiction to our nation\u2019s long history of welcoming immigrants and bestowing inalienable rights\u201d on all people born here, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, she said. Supporters of the bill say automatic citizenship provides an incentive for women to risk coming to the country illegally. They call U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants \u201canchor babies\u201d because, when they become adults, the children can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residency. \u201cComing into the country for the express purpose of having a child in order to anchor that child and yourself is, in effect, gaming the system,\u201d Dane said. Lisa Navarrete, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said the proposed law wouldn\u2019t stem illegal immigration and would make the problem worse because not only would illegal immigrants be undocumented, their American-born children would be too. \u201cThe worst part of it is you end up with potentially millions of children who are stateless, who were born here and have no ties to any other country, yet they\u2019re not considered citizens or part of the United States,\u201d she said. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the policy of granting automatic citizenship to people born here is \u201cout of sync with the modern world.\u201d He and Deal said that the U.S. is one of the few wealthy industrialized nations that still allows birthright citizenship. Deal, who has submitted his bill to the House Judiciary Committee, said he\u2019s not optimistic about it becoming law this year unless it is tacked onto another bill. \u201cI think the current makeup of the Congress is such that this will never get a hearing and will never be an issue that we get a chance to vote on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\u201d",

Authored by Congressman Nathan Deal (R-GA) and co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 46 other Members of the House of Representatives, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 (H.R.1868) would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to change the current interpretation of federal law that automatically confers citizenship to any child born in the United States regardless of the immigration status of the child's parents. (See H.R. 1868 Legislative Text and Co-sponsor Listing). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 has received increasing attention in the media.<edit>. (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009; '11Alive.com', May 26, 2009; WRBL, May 27, 2009). The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009 does not seek to amend the Constitution, but would instead amend a statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to clarify the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. Congressman Deal's bill would limit birthright citizenship only to children born to at least one parent who is either: (1) a citizen or national of the United States; (2) a lawful permanent resident; or (3) actively serving in the U.S. military. The legislation would only apply prospectively and would not \"affect the citizenship or nationality status of any person born before the date of the [bill's] enactment.\" (H.R.1868, April 2, 2009). Congressman Deal noted that the United States is one of only a few industrialized countries who still allow birthright citizenship. While stating he was skeptical about the bill's chances of passage, he said, \"I think it's important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\" (The Associated Press, May 25, 2009). AP.'http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/05/25/citizenship_bill.html' U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, has proposed changing the long-standing federal policy that automatically grants citizenship to any baby born on U.S. soil, a move opposed by immigrant rights advocates. Supporters of Deal\u2019s proposal say \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d encourages illegal immigration and makes enforcement of immigration laws more difficult. Opponents say the proposed law wouldn\u2019t solve the illegal immigration problem and goes against this country\u2019s traditions of welcoming immigrants. Recent headlines: <edit> Automatic citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d That provision, ratified in 1868, was drafted with freed slaves in mind. Deal and his supporters say the 14th Amendment wording was never meant to automatically give citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants. \u201cThis is a sensible, overdue measure that closes a clause that was never meant to be a loophole,\u201d said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks tighter immigration restrictions. Under Deal\u2019s proposal, babies born in the U.S. would automatically have citizenship only if at least one of their parents is a U.S. citizen or national, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., or actively serving in the U.S. military. Azadeh Shahshahani, director of the Immigrants Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, said the proposed law \u201cis not cognizant with the American spirit.\u201d \u201cWe would stand in strong opposition to this bill as it\u2019s in fundamental contradiction to our nation\u2019s long history of welcoming immigrants and bestowing inalienable rights\u201d on all people born here, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, she said. Supporters of the bill say automatic citizenship provides an incentive for women to risk coming to the country illegally. They call U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants \u201canchor babies\u201d because, when they become adults, the children can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residency. \u201cComing into the country for the express purpose of having a child in order to anchor that child and yourself is, in effect, gaming the system,\u201d Dane said. Lisa Navarrete, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said the proposed law wouldn\u2019t stem illegal immigration and would make the problem worse because not only would illegal immigrants be undocumented, their American-born children would be too. \u201cThe worst part of it is you end up with potentially millions of children who are stateless, who were born here and have no ties to any other country, yet they\u2019re not considered citizens or part of the United States,\u201d she said. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the policy of granting automatic citizenship to people born here is \u201cout of sync with the modern world.\u201d He and Deal said that the U.S. is one of the few wealthy industrialized nations that still allows birthright citizenship. Deal, who has submitted his bill to the House Judiciary Committee, said he\u2019s not optimistic about it becoming law this year unless it is tacked onto another bill. \u201cI think the current makeup of the Congress is such that this will never get a hearing and will never be an issue that we get a chance to vote on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to keep the issues that are part of the immigration problem alive.\u201d",
