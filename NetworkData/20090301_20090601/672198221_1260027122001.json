WITHIN DAYS of the CDC (Atlanta) receiving a virus sample from the Mexican Government, the CDC defined this virus as totally new... and totally unique. We are about ten days downrange from that date if memory serves. The states of Texas and California didn't know they were dealing with a new virus either as there have only been 2-3 cases reported (as of now) since the CDC made its declaration. San Diego County and Imperial County (on the mexican border) in California... and one single city in Texas are the only known US cases. Again... this information has only arisen AFTER the Mexican Government sent CDC the sample for identification. Prior to that Mexico was thinking that they just had an outbreak of an existing flu type. But now that government is taking rather strict actions to limit its further spread... actions that the CDC thinks may be too late. As for the mortality rate... no one has died in the USA. Perhaps because we have better medical aid for the most part. In Mexico a little under 1100 cases have been identified so far since testing for the exact CDC confirmed virus began. Of taht at LEAST 62 deaths have already resulted. That is roughly 6% mortality rate... That is very high by US standards. Again it is not known exactly how many deats or infections there actually are in Mexico at this point. too much is never reported there. BTW: say 100 million Americans get exposed to this new virus... do you think a 5% or 6% mortality rate could be realistic? I am not certain myself. My fear is that Mexico is NOT ground zero for this virus strain. I am kind of worried that it originated in points south of Mexico where reporting is almost non-existant. And for a few more months I have loved ones down there... working it the area where viruses incubate and are easily transmitted. There is no cure or prevention for this swine flu bug. All one can do is ride it out. Not the best answer for a warm and fuzzy feeling.",

WHY have they been dragging their heels so? ) ... cases already in at least five states, three countries (Mexico, Canada, US), with two more suspected (NZ and France). STFU and let the pros do their job. CJ. You'll benefit for it, and beyotch the whole time.",

Just what can the CDC do to stop mutations? And no one even knew that AIDS was a disease. This was because AIDS doesn't kill you, other diseases take advantage of your lower immune system to do that. Everyone seems to have forgotten this about AIDS. On this thread the CDC is being blamed for not acting sooner - Heck, no one even knew this was occuring. There are now eight confirmed cases in New York. Kids \"flew\" to Mexico on some sort of arranged trip - Didn't \"cross\" any borders. So is the CDC responsible for not acting when they had nothing to act on? Schid happens. Dave",
