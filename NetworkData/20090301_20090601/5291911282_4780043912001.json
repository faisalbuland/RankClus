        "content": "Just watching the North Korean Missile sitting on the pad. Lots of stock footage of the NK soldiers marching. Of note was the way they were marching. They were stiff legged and bringing the legs down quick and sharply. I have been part of a unit that did a lot of marching in parades for the 1976 bicentennial year celebrations that were going on all over the country. We did a foot stomp kind of step with taps on the shoes for an dynamic audible cue. Just doing that particular step has caused me to have pinched nerves in my feet that can be very disabling at times. I can't even begin to fathom all of the health related problems these guys are going to have from the type of march step they do there in North Korea. Hip, knee, ankles all have to suffer greatly from these kind of marching. The upside is that if we get into it with the North Koreans, we can write off their foot mobility, cause these guys are really gonna be hurting. Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
