The oil company is widely seen as conducting business deals meant to expand China's influence worldwide. One of its recent attempts to purchase a large U.S. oil firm drew bipartisan congressional opposition amid fears the deal would harm American national security interests. Charles \"Chas\" Freeman, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War, is slated to head the U.S. National Intelligence Council. The NIC is a crucial component of the U.S. intelligence apparatus, serving as the center for midterm and long-term strategic thinking within the American intelligence community. It provides intelligence briefs for Obama and key U.S. agencies and produces reports that help determine American policy on crucial issues, such as Iran's nuclear program. Since 2004, Freeman has been on the international advisory board of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC. \u2022 Iran Can Get Material to Make 50 Nukes -- Iran can develop a nuclear weapon within a year and has ready access to enough fissile material to produce up to 50 nuclear weapons, according to a panel of current and former U.S. officials advising the Obama administration. William Schneider, Jr., chairman of the Defense Science Board and a former under secretary of state in the Reagan administration, offered those estimates Wednesday during a news conference announcing the release of a new \"Presidential Task Force\" report on Iran by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u2022 Iran urges world Muslim 'resistance' against Israel -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Wednesday for world Muslims to join the Palestinian \"resistance\" against Israel as he kicked off a two-day summit in aid of war-torn Gaza. His statement came as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and premier Salam Fayyad in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on her first visit to the region since taking office. She had met Israeli leaders in Jerusalem on Tueaday. \"The only way to save Palestine is resistance,\" Khamenei said in his address to open the global summit Tehran organised in aid of Gaza and the Palestinians. \"Support and help to Palestinians is a mandatory duty of all Muslims. I now tell all Muslim brothers and sisters to join forces and break the immunity of the Zionist criminals,\" Khamenei said. \u2022 Clinton says U.S. diplomacy unlikely to end Iran nuclear program -- The Obama administration has already concluded that a diplomatic overture to Iran, one of the central promises of the president's election campaign, is unlikely to persuade Tehran to give up its nuclear ambitions. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates in a private meeting Monday that it is \"very doubtful\" a U.S. approach will persuade Iran to relent, said a senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under customary diplomatic rules. \u2022 Iran demands Hollywood apology -- Iran's presidential arts adviser, Javad Shamqadari, is quoted by Iran's ISNA news agency as saying: \"We will only believe Obama's policy of change when we see a change in Hollywood too.\" Shamqadari also said that Iran's cinema officials would meet with members of the delegation only if they apologize for the \"insults and slanders they have hurled at the Iranian nation over the past 30 years.\" Shamqadari said that Iranian hospitality did not prevent Tehran from urging the Hollywood team to apologize and added that Hollywood is making other films aimed at \"insulting and accusing\" Iran. Last week, a spokesman from Iran's Foreign Ministry said that Hollywood \"has 30 anti-Iranian movies in the offing with the subject of hostility towards Iran's historical and Islamic identity.\" Films like \"300\" and \"The Wrestler\" have particularly angered the Iranians.",

We have Iran on either side and they will be a major thorn in our side in either Iraq or Afghanistan. It will take a small core of nations that are determined to eliminate this Iranian threat to carry it our. right now I see only three, the US, Britain and Israel. France is paralyzed by the muslim extremists in its country and will not join such a coalition. Our Coast Guard needs to be increased and in some cases have larger fighting ships to protect our coast line from renegade freighters or other ships that may attempt a surprise attack against the US. Times are changing and the Air surveillance and intercept mechanisms of this nation need to be within fifteen minutes of any plane, ship or other means of attack.

The Iranians are not stupid and not as radicalised or anti American as some of you believe. They may from time to time attempt to pull a hair from the Tigers tail, it plays well to the home crowd, but they will never try to cut it off! Are any of you aware that after 9/11 Iranians held very large and spontaneous demonstrations in support of the US, and its government provided intelligence CRUCIAL to the success of the Allied mission in Afghanistan and later, Iraq? Not the acts of a rogue state. Only then to find itself labelled as part of the Axis Of Evil. A bit of a slap in the face to a nation which was doing its best to ingratiate itself back into the Intentional community when it saw the chance of dialogue presented to it by the tragedy of 9/11. Let the slating begin.",
