I think people should get mental check ups...to make sure its not a nut job buying a gun..planing on killing college students or work place employees etc..but life itself is one big gamble.... Im wishy washy abt it..I dont want the gov. controling everything I do, even though Im afraid of guns......Im not in the military...my husband is ret airforce, my father ret army, and i have two sons who one is still in the army and one just got out of the airforce...whew...and a whole history of relatives who fought for freedom... Our constitution states that we shall be able to bare arms to fight off a despotic gov. ..one that is killing its people..as is going on in some other countries right now...also that we can hunt to eat...quite a few people still hunt and my husband did so for years ..deer meat we ate dear meat for many meals...cooked in many different ways...not as fattening...also to protect yourself.. my husband says that if we are required to register our guns..the next step is to take them away and they will know where they are. He also says LUBYS WOULDNT HAVE HAPPENED...WHEN THAT GUY drove his jeep into luby's if anyone had a gun all those people wouldnt have been killed... one problem i see is if...your not really on your game...and someone attacks you and you have a concealed to carry...they can take it away from you and kill you... like I said..what if...however, my husband and I think that guns were meant to hunt and to protect....but there are some hotheads out there who should never be near a gun... so politically speaking..it's an issue...our left wing gov is trying to take over everything...take away our means to defend ourselves..first... then,take away most of our rights...keep watching the news.. they are even trying to take away responsibility for our own kids...so the gov can raise them...communism...like...not telling the parents that their daughter had an abortion or...not getting permission from the parents for it to happen..Imagine the gov taking over our kids.. teaching kids the wrong imoral things in school irregardless of what the parents want... HOw about taking your money away from you and giving it to another irregardless of what you want...or..the gov taking over education..my son goes to college and he gets loans..we have the choice of financial institutions that we want to hold the loan...in 2010..the gov is taking over the holding of the loans...I had no idea abt this until I spoke with our loan institution and they told us that its being taken away from them by our gov...why is this??..that means the gov has control ..and basically they cant afford to manage that many loans...The way it was done...was the right way..with financial institutions...the pell grant is an entirely differnet thing... slowly, bit by bit..the gov is taking over everything.. land of the free and freedom of choice will no longer be...if we dissagree...then we are racist...I think that obama is just a PAWN for the lefties...they have had this going for some time..and got obama in there to pass gov take overs and when we dissagree we are racist because we are dissagreeing with our president who happens to be black...which means we are racist...well, what they didnt think of is this..I went to school in military schools and I was use to every kind of race...so that is out the window...I got use to different kinds of people and loved it..so, this won't work on me..Im going to dissagree.. so its not really a black and white issue..pardon the pun...its an evil issue of a very left wing...communistic view of life...desiring to do what it has always intended to do...create another russia..destroy what we have..FREEDOMS AS DEFINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND BASED ON THIS AND THIS ALONE..i SHALL ALWAYS BELIEVE AND STAND UP FOR OUR FREEDOMS TO HAVE A GUN OR GUNS AND BARE ARMS ESP AGAINST A DESPOTIC GOV...WHICH IS JUST A WAY OF DEFENDING OUR CONSTITUTION...ALSO DEFENDING OUR CHRISTIAN RIGHTS...IN GOD WE TRUST.. this country is so very divided..but even people who dont agree on everything can see what is happening...slowly our own freedoms are being taken away...and its on both sides of the political realm...

He also says LUBYS WOULDNT HAVE HAPPENED...WHEN THAT GUY drove his jeep into luby's if anyone had a gun all those people wouldnt have been killed... one problem i see is if...your not really on your game...and someone attacks you and you have a concealed to carry...they can take it away from you and kill you... like I said..what if...however, my husband and I think that guns were meant to hunt and to protect....but there are some hotheads out there who should never be near a gun... so politically speaking..it's an issue...our left wing gov is trying to take over everything...take away our means to defend ourselves..first... then,take away most of our rights...keep watching the news.. they are even trying to take away responsibility for our own kids...so the gov can raise them...communism...like...not telling the parents that their daughter had an abortion or...not getting permission from the parents for it to happen..Imagine the gov taking over our kids.. teaching kids the wrong imoral things in school irregardless of what the parents want... HOw about taking your money away from you and giving it to another irregardless of what you want...or..the gov taking over education..my son goes to college and he gets loans..we have the choice of financial institutions that we want to hold the loan...in 2010..the gov is taking over the holding of the loans...I had no idea abt this until I spoke with our loan institution and they told us that its being taken away from them by our gov...why is this??..that means the gov has control ..and basically they cant afford to manage that many loans...The way it was done...was the right way..with financial institutions...the pell grant is an entirely differnet thing... slowly, bit by bit..the gov is taking over everything.. land of the free and freedom of choice will no longer be...if we dissagree...then we are racist...I think that obama is just a PAWN for the lefties...they have had this going for some time..and got obama in there to pass gov take overs and when we dissagree we are racist because we are dissagreeing with our president who happens to be black...which means we are racist...well, what they didnt think of is this..I went to school in military schools and I was use to every kind of race...so that is out the window...I got use to different kinds of people and loved it..so, this won't work on me..Im going to dissagree.. so its not really a black and white issue..pardon the pun...its an evil issue of a very left wing...communistic view of life...desiring to do what it has always intended to do...create another russia..destroy what we have..FREEDOMS AS DEFINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND BASED ON THIS AND THIS ALONE..i SHALL ALWAYS BELIEVE AND STAND UP FOR OUR FREEDOMS TO HAVE A GUN OR GUNS AND BARE ARMS ESP AGAINST A DESPOTIC GOV...WHICH IS JUST A WAY OF DEFENDING OUR CONSTITUTION...ALSO DEFENDING OUR CHRISTIAN RIGHTS...IN GOD WE TRUST.. this country is so very divided..but even people who dont agree on everything can see what is happening...slowly our own freedoms are being taken away...and its on both sides of the political realm...

Don't be suprised if Uncle say's ya not only have to register your guns. You will need to take a 10 hour training course on how to use guns.

In addition to the license, you will be required to be insured and bonded! I've already done the first. I have to re-new every 10 years (Concealed Weapons Carry) - - Oh!, I get it, you have a CCW, you are an honest law abiding citizen. You have to renew your permit every 10 years. Now a bad guy is carrying an unregistered gun. He holds up a store, he use's his gun. He gets a few hundred dollars, he is arrested, convicted and sentenced to 5 to 10 years. He does 7 years, gets out, goes home. He meets some of his buddies and he gets another unregistered gun. He picks up his criminal life where he left off seven years ago. He robs another store during commission of the robbery he kills the store clerk. He is arrested, convicted and sentenced to 10 to 15 years. He does 12 years, gets out, the whole cycle repeats itself. He gets another unregistered gun, robs store, kills clerk. Arrested concvicted, 3 strikes law applies, he gets life. He dosen't care, the taxpayer will provide food, shelter, free medical, free dental. If he got the death sentence, his lawyers will file appeals, stalling the death penalty he earned and deserves. In the end, he may die in prison from natural causes. All this could have been prevented if we had tougher laws dealing with criminals. Using the death penalty as it is intended, only one appeal allowed. Give the criminal two choices for his death penalty, hanging or the needle. He gets exercise equipment, tv, music, a library and other freebies, all paid for by us, the taxpayer. If he could get out, he'd do it all over again. Keep smiling, everyone will wonder what you've been up to!",
