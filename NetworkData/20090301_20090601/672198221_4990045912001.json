Several thousand well-wishers crowded the traffic circle in front of the gated palace on Wednesday to cheer and wave as the limousine carrying Obama and first lady Michelle Obama rolled past. On the eve of a global economic summit, Obama promised world leaders he would listen, not lecture, as they seek a common fix to the financial crisis. \"We can only meet this challenge together,\" he said Wednesday as the U.S. and Russia spoke on the summit sidelines about nuclear warhead reduction. The flurry of diplomacy came as Obama stepped on the world stage for the first time as president, aiming to shore up both America's economy and its reputation across the globe. He met with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao \u2014 and promptly accepted invitations to visit Russia in July and China sometime in the second half of the year. Thousands of protesters converged on central London to rally against the economic summit. In the most dominant development, Obama and Medvedev announced talks to limit the number of nuclear warheads, the first major negotiations in years over what Obama called the \"gravest threat to humanity.\" Meanwhile, speaking directly to anxious families back home, Obama sought to restore consumer confidence and encourage people to think about spending now to help their future. (...) Brown said he was confident Sarkozy would still be at the table when the dinner was complete. In London, Obama is also meeting with Brown's main rival \u2014 David Cameron, the leader of Britain's opposition Conservative Party. This message has been edited.
