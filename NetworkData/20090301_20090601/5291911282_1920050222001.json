Remember, we have suffered crashes in EVERY major fighter purchase. This one event is not an indicator of how well the acft will perform. A F-22 prototype crashed due to flghht control software issue, but yet the program went on. A F-14 crashed in Long Isald during that program's infancy, but yet they did well for over 30 years.",
