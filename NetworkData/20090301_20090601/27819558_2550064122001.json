Before you jump to defend someone's actions, you would do well to understand both the person and the source of his teachings. Falwell, Sr. was as devoted to hating anything related to homosexuals as he was to spreading his personal vision of a Christian nation no matter how much of the bible he had to twist around and he stooped to any level to bring people to his way of thinking. If you truly want to know the truth, study the etymology of the word \"homosexual\". You'll learn that the word didn't even exist in print until 1967. So how could it possibly have existed in a bible created over a thousand years ago? If you still don't believe, study the exact location of the word \"homosexual\" in any authoritative version. In the KJV, you'll only see that word in Corinthians. This chapter in the bible is not Jesus' teachings; it is Paul the Apostle ranting about what is wrong with the Christian church in Corinth. My studies have shown consistently that Paul was a busy-body that jumped at any opportunity to criticize others for falling short of Jesus' teachings. And for further perspective on the KJV, there were a number of scribes commissioned to translate the bible from Greek into what would become the King James version. The first 2 scribes were killed after submitting their work... Fortunately, the next scribe got the message and produced a translation that agreed with King James' line of thinking. Funny how the word of God doesn't seem to apply to those in power, huh? Or is it just that the ones in power define the word of God? Just a side note... Only 53 posts and you already know how to get around the profanity filter and which words to tap-dance around...? Not your only account here?",
