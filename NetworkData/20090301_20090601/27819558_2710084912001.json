A bill that would allow gays to serve openly has been introduced in Congress.

They certainly learn early on in life how to stigmatize that which the dominant culture tells them is 'q u e a r' or deviant... often they learn it from their parents and then certainly their peers. You can not stop life legally or rationally. (And I am not extolling it as a perk... it certainly can create problems in parenting and learning morality... but 'who ya gonna call?'

They certainly learn early on in life how to stigmatize that which the dominant culture tells them is 'q u e a r' or deviant... often they learn it from their parents and then certainly their peers. You can not stop life legally or rationally. (And I am not extolling it as a perk... it certainly can create problems in parenting and learning morality... but 'who ya gonna call?'
