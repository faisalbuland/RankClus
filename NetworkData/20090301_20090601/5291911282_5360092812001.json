I do not recommend that anybody get into the stock market unless they are willing to lose the money that is their initial investment. Almost all of my investments are outside the stock market. I do have an online account with Scottrade that I started a few years ago with a $500 initial investment. I now carry a $10,000 balance there. All earnings that exceed $10k I withdrawal and invest outside the stock market. Since September 2008 my stock market portfolio is up 15%. So, just because the market is down, that does not mean there isn't money to be made by investors. It is the speculators and gamblers that lose money. And, the buy and hold people are probably the biggest losers in this regard. As for savings, you can always make interest that exceeds inflation in certificates and money market accounts. You can't now because the rates are down. But, if you locked in a 5 year certificate 6 months ago with a 5% dividend that is compounded daily, you would be well above what inflation has been over the past decade. To say that those who save and/or invest in the markets would have less money today than a year ago only proves that you aren't knowledgeable on the subject.",
