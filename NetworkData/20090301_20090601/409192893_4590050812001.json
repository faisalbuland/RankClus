Why is that Peter? Not sure your figure is correct, but plenty of people did complain. And even if you didn't complain..you can still draw the line at Obama..who has spent more in less then 100 days then Bush did in eight YEARS. On top of that, Bush had to deal with 9-11 and funding a global war. But think about this: Do you really want to resort to using what Bush did to defend Obama? Isn't that defeat for you?",

Thank you Threerings What I heard the most watching the hearing where the CEO of AIG was being questioned, was he kept speaking of one division that received most of these bonuses. The personing earning them were to close their books within one year from last January. I don't believe this was the only benchmark they had to achieve to receive said bonus. Turn a large profit for the company, receive a decent bonus. Turn a modest profit, receive a modest if at all bonus.

One company I worked for as a computer programmer my salary was less then $30,000 a year. But i was paid a bonus based on the performance of MY department..not the company. There where years I recieved a 30 or 40K bonus and the company itself was not doing very well. There was one year we received a 15K bonus, despite the average in the company being over 50K because our department sucked. I think most of you have no idea what a bonus is and how they are used in the real world.", 
        "reply": " Thank you Threerings What I heard the most watching the hearing where the CEO of AIG was being questioned, was he kept speaking of one division that received most of these bonuses. The personing earning them were to close their books within one year from last January. I don't believe this was the only benchmark they had to achieve to receive said bonus. Turn a large profit for the company, receive a decent bonus. Turn a modest profit, receive a modest if at all bonus. Fail to show profit or progress and you receive a G'Day Bob clear your desk please, that or a promotion.",

If AIG, and all of these other companies had filed for bankruptcy, they would bear all risk and responsibility of rescuing their companies, or, if by continually acting irresponsibly, they would fail. So now, we have the taxpayers bearing all risk. Are these companies acting any more responsibly? No. Thanks to socializing risk, they, bear no risk and don't have to change a damned thing. Do you think a majority of those in that company are looking to reorganize and succeed? Or take the money and run? So, as you say, putting the capitalist back in capitalism would be great, but the President, and many others in congress are preventing that from happening.",
