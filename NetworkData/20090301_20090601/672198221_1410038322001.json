They\u2019re tucked away on a ledge in a tranquil valley not far from a picturesque waterfall. In the prone position, you can see that a gap between the stacks looks out on an all-too-vulnerable bridge a few hundred meters away. Once vehicles come into view, the enemy hiding here could detonate a roadside bomb or perhaps call another hidden fighter to do the deed. Insurgents have good reason for targeting the bridge. It\u2019s part of a narrow, axle-grinding path between Khost city and Gardez that is the only main route linking Khost province with the rest of Afghanistan. The road\u2019s narrow, bumpy surface deters all but the most determined drivers. American leaders have made repaving the so-called KG Pass Road a national priority to bring Khost and other previously neglected areas back into the fold with the rest of Afghanistan. The region has been the site of some of Afghanistan\u2019s most successful fights against foreign armies. The road was paved when Soviet forces entered the region. They occupied the area for a time, but mujahedeen flooded back in as soon as they left. The Afghans tore up miles of pavement afterward to ensure the Soviets couldn\u2019t bring their tanks back into the area. The area\u2019s violent history continues. Most of the insurgent attacks have targeted local forces, but enemy fighters ambushed two American convoys without success in the middle of May as the traditional summer fighting season arrived. The 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment \u2014 the unit responsible for the area \u2014 also lost a soldier and had others wounded during a spring offensive launched in March to knock the insurgents off balance. Contractors have been targeted, too, but leaders are still trying to determine whether competing contractors could be to blame.
