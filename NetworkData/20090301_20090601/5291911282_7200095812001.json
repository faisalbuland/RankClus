Just last week we saw an increase in unemployment in Oregon and requests for basic assistance from food banks have skyrocketed. Yet as families have cut their spending to the bare necessities, financial firms that have received more than $700 billion in federal bailout money are handing out extravagant bonuses. This is outrageous. Much of the current meltdown in America\u2019s financial sector has resulted from a lack of transparency and oversight. This has enabled gross misuse of federal funds within the financial industry. I, like many of you, was appalled when American Insurance Group\u2019s (AIG) chose to lavishly reward the same so-called executives that ran the company into the ground with extravagant bonuses paid for with taxpayer money. I developed legislation to tax these bonuses 100% (yes, I know this might be problematic but frankly those in AIG's Product Division don't deserve a dime and those who ran the operation should be fired!) I also co-sponsored and the House passed, a bill introduced by the Ways and Means Committee to place a 90 percent federal tax on the bonuses received by any executive working for a company that received more than $5 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This legislation was passed the House with overwhelming support. Congress has the right to recoup these ill-deserved bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole. While we continue to try and get our financial house in order, our communities need help with jobs and support for families. Last month, I voted for and the President signed into law, The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. This act does more than create jobs; it provides Oregonians and our nation with tax relief. It also has additional measures that allow unemployed Oregonians to continue to have health care, allows low income families to receive additional relief for their children, and help college students pay for their education. My respone: Well Earl I have a problem with those doing the chastising. You see these guys are getting lambasted for making bad decisions and implementing a failing policy in their companies. How is this any different than the pay raises that Senate and the House gave themselves in light of the current economic crisis. Aren't you folks in the Congress and Legislature doing the exact same thing? Hypocrisy, is the only thing I see coming out of Washington D.C. and you know what I mean. We were supposed to get change, yet the only changes are the names and the positions in committee. Maybe the rest of the constituency can't see the hypocrisy, But I sure can. Maybe when people point fingers they shouldn't have there hand in the same cookie jar. As far as the issue of transparency and oversight being the problem for the current crisis, all I have to say is; \"On whose watch did this happen?\" It's easy to blame this on policy but lets face it Earl it happened on your watch. Why weren't you as aware then as you are now? When it comes to that 90% tax on the earnings from bonuses if the company gained more than 5 million dollars from TARP funds? Maybe we should think about applying that tax to some politicians who think they are above the common folk. Amos Singletary had something to say about that at the constitutional convention in Philadelphia. And I fear his Leviathon has become a real monster. Now I fear that the big rush will be on to get and squander the money as fast as the State can spend it. It reminds me of the rush into Oklahoma's territory. Gross mismanagement will be discovered throughout this proccess and you know it. But Pandora's box has been opened and you will have to face the facts when the mischief comes about. A dissatisfied customer. Do you think he got the message? Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",

Obama MUST have his \"agenda\", at all co$ts. That's the bottom line. \"Can't ya see...oh, Lord, what his BUDGET'S done to me??\" Obama continues to arrogantly cock his head, ignore the camera, and speak in parsed, three-word strings like the true lawyer he is, while the economy goes down in flames around us, and he throws more fuel on the fire at every Pelosi-Reid-Geithner-aided point. This Cabinet is among the WORST, if not the very WORST I've ever seen. Talk about the Three Stooges! Now there are some 15, and they've not all been picked and confirmed yet! What a CIRCUS of LOSERS! Tax cheats running Tresury and several other KEY agencies...and Obama spews lies upon blatant LIES; he DEMANDS that we back him unconditionally, even as the competence level of his administration is found to be sorely lacking with nearly every turn and every new day's revelations. Geithner KNEW about the bonuses...Fannie & Freddie are doing the SAME kind of crap, with OUR MONEY, and WITHOUT OUR CONSENT/PERMISSION/INPUT/VOTE! These jacka*s clowns just DON'T GET IT...how much CLEARER and MORE OBVIOUS does it have to be? Hellloooo!! I am just so FED-UP, it makes me want to throw up! The sheer, unprecedented AUDACITY and the guileless GREED of these GROSSLY OVERPAID \"exec$\", and the total amorality of this whole financial me$$ is almost too much for this normally laid-back, unflappable \"old salt\" to comprehend, tolerate and accept. It's awful. Obama thinks everything is \"peachy-keen\"! He also thinks we are just too STUPID to know better or to figure out something's gone terribly wrong here. Remember, he's a LAWYER! They are indoctrinated/trained to think they are somehow 'better' and 'smarter' than the 'great unwashed'(public) they work for. WE KNOW BETTER! Life's bumpy 'roads' are a great teacher!",

Just last week we saw an increase in unemployment in Oregon and requests for basic assistance from food banks have skyrocketed. Yet as families have cut their spending to the bare necessities, financial firms that have received more than $700 billion in federal bailout money are handing out extravagant bonuses. This is outrageous. Much of the current meltdown in America\u2019s financial sector has resulted from a lack of transparency and oversight. This has enabled gross misuse of federal funds within the financial industry. I, like many of you, was appalled when American Insurance Group\u2019s (AIG) chose to lavishly reward the same so-called executives that ran the company into the ground with extravagant bonuses paid for with taxpayer money. I developed legislation to tax these bonuses 100% (yes, I know this might be problematic but frankly those in AIG's Product Division don't deserve a dime and those who ran the operation should be fired!) I also co-sponsored and the House passed, a bill introduced by the Ways and Means Committee to place a 90 percent federal tax on the bonuses received by any executive working for a company that received more than $5 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This legislation was passed the House with overwhelming support. Congress has the right to recoup these ill-deserved bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole. While we continue to try and get our financial house in order, our communities need help with jobs and support for families. Last month, I voted for and the President signed into law, The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. This act does more than create jobs; it provides Oregonians and our nation with tax relief. It also has additional measures that allow unemployed Oregonians to continue to have health care, allows low income families to receive additional relief for their children, and help college students pay for their education. My respone: Well Earl I have a problem with those doing the chastising. You see these guys are getting lambasted for making bad decisions and implementing a failing policy in their companies. How is this any different than the pay raises that Senate and the House gave themselves in light of the current economic crisis. Aren't you folks in the Congress and Legislature doing the exact same thing? Hypocrisy, is the only thing I see coming out of Washington D.C. and you know what I mean. We were supposed to get change, yet the only changes are the names and the positions in committee. Maybe the rest of the constituency can't see the hypocrisy, But I sure can. Maybe when people point fingers they shouldn't have there hand in the same cookie jar. As far as the issue of transparency and oversight being the problem for the current crisis, all I have to say is; \"On whose watch did this happen?\" It's easy to blame this on policy but lets face it Earl it happened on your watch. Why weren't you as aware then as you are now? When it comes to that 90% tax on the earnings from bonuses if the company gained more than 5 million dollars from TARP funds? Maybe we should think about applying that tax to some politicians who think they are above the common folk. Amos Singletary had something to say about that at the constitutional convention in Philadelphia. And I fear his Leviathon has become a real monster. Now I fear that the big rush will be on to get and squander the money as fast as the State can spend it. It reminds me of the rush into Oklahoma's territory. Gross mismanagement will be discovered throughout this proccess and you know it. But Pandora's box has been opened and you will have to face the facts when the mischief comes about. A dissatisfied customer. Do you think he got the message? Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
