A few months back I posted an interesting story About a big investigation being held on Fraudulent Pensions That had been going on for years. It was being investigated by Nassau county ex. Tom Souzzi, Nassau county DA, and state Attorney Coumo. It seems somone discovered that all retired LIRR worker were recieving Disability Pensions Upon investigation Two union officials confessed that they counciled retiring workers that for a few thousand dollars they could get them disability pensions and early full SS. the story dropped off the radar screen. No follow up on sentencing or or attempts to get back the illegally obtained monies. last week I wrote to the newspapers asking for an explanation or a follow up. I have recieved no response. Now nassau county Suozzie says his budget is 130 million short and hes raising taxes and cutting services. So I wrote him a letter saying that I didnt get a resonse from the newspapers and now was asking him the outcome of the LIRR pension fraud. So far no response from his office. So guess where Im going next State Attorney then Attorney General. I will not give up and will get an answer. They publisized the investigation for a week every day promised to prosecute the guilty, Promised to recoupe the Fraudelent pensions and SS then dropped off the radar completely. And now there asking for 130 million more to balance the county budget. I wonder who else was involved or how high up it went to stop so abruptly. So where did true and Honest American Journalism Go?",

A few months back I posted an interesting story About a big investigation being held on Fraudulent Pensions That had been going on for years. It was being investigated by Nassau county ex. Tom Souzzi, Nassau county DA, and state Attorney Coumo. It seems somone discovered that all retired LIRR worker were recieving Disability Pensions Upon investigation Two union officials confessed that they counciled retiring workers that for a few thousand dollars they could get them disability pensions and early full SS. the story dropped off the radar screen. No follow up on sentencing or or attempts to get back the illegally obtained monies. last week I wrote to the newspapers asking for an explanation or a follow up. I have recieved no response. Now nassau county Suozzie says his budget is 130 million short and hes raising taxes and cutting services. So I wrote him a letter saying that I didnt get a resonse from the newspapers and now was asking him the outcome of the LIRR pension fraud. So far no response from his office. So guess where Im going next State Attorney then Attorney General. I will not give up and will get an answer. They publisized the investigation for a week every day promised to prosecute the guilty, Promised to recoupe the Fraudelent pensions and SS then dropped off the radar completely. And now there asking for 130 million more to balance the county budget. I wonder who else was involved or how high up it went to stop so abruptly. So where did true and Honest American Journalism Go?",

If we want to talk about how bad journalism has gotten, look no further than Foxnews. And sorry, before anyone jumps in about MSNBC being the opposite but equivalent as Foxnews, it's nowhere even close. Keith Olbermann is not the equivalent to Bill O'Reilly, Rachel Maddow is not Sean Hannity, and along the same lines, Al Franken was never Rush Limbaugh. And why is that? What's the difference? Anytime I watch pundits on MSNBC, I'll see them go after politicians, bureaucrats, pundits, or policies, but never other Americans. Foxnews? It's pundits, guests, and so called \"Foxfacts\" will go after anyone they deem as \"not a real American\" and tie it under the umbrella of \"liberal\". It is the most watered down brand of journalism because it will play up the \"us versus them\" basic human instinct. Atheists are liberals just like radical Muslims are liberals. Environmentalists are liberals just like Union workers are liberal. Pro choice people are liberal the same way anti war people are liberal. If you don't agree with the marching orders 100% of the time, you're a LIBERAL. Not a real American. Someone trying to destroy this country. Foxnews is not news, it's not informative, and it's not journalism. It's tabloid news. It's watered down entertainment and it plays on our most primitive instincts. When complex issues are reduced to \"liberal\" and \"socialist\" labels and talking points, you as the viewer are saved from the hard work of thinking it through and forming your own opinion. Not clear enough? Watch it scroll across our screen as \"Fox Fact\" (e.g. Democrats are Legislating Defeat In Draft PERIOD) If anyone want to ask what's happened to journalism in American look to Foxnews first and foremost. While it may be agreed that Fox is hardly the best that journalism has to offer, to tout the abilities of the swill merchants from MSNBC as being exemplary defies every known convention of decency. Aside from the never ending anti-W diatribes and contrived \"facts\" administration apologists such as Maddow and Olbermann have absolutely nothing to offer reasonably intelligent people. The h o m oertoic musings of Chris Matthews speaks for itself. This message has been edited. Last edited by: adminnco1, Tue 05 May 2009 03:05 AM",
