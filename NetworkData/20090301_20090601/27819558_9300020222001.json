        "content": "Now Arlen Specter is a Democrat! Forty-two percent of Americans now say same sex couples should be allowed to legally marry, a new CBS News/New York Times poll finds. That's up nine points from last month, when 33 percent supported legalizing same sex marriage. Support for same sex marriage is now at its highest point since CBS News starting asking about it in 2004. America needs to wake up. More and more young people refuse to share previous generations' bigotries towards homosexuals. Also more and more young people are not identifying themselves as \"straight\" or heterosexual. Gay marriage is inevitable and if you choose to fight it when there are so many issues out there that are so much more important then you are just wasting your time and energy.",
