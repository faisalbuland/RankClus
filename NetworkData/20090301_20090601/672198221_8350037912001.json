Deputies performed CPR on Hutchison until EMS arrived, but he died at the scene. The medical examiner's office removed the body from the driveway just before 8:30 a.m. Misener was not injured PS: Unfortunatly the homeowner used a sawed off shotgun.

The medical examiner's office removed the body from the driveway just before 8:30 a.m. Misener was not injured PS: Unfortunatly the homeowner used a sawed off shotgun.

Homeowner Sterling Misener, 44, heard an alarm and went out to the vehicle.

Deputies performed CPR on Hutchison until EMS arrived, but he died at the scene. The medical examiner's office removed the body from the driveway just before 8:30 a.m. Misener was not injured PS: Unfortunatly the homeowner used a sawed off shotgun. Which is illegal so it's not 100%. He may end up with a charge.",

Shortly after noon, about 10 people were released from the building, the reports said, and about 40 minutes later another 10 were released. The Binghamton Police Department declined to provide details of the shootings, as officers and members of local SWAT teams surrounded the building, situated on a mixed commercial and residential strip on the west bank of the Chenango River near the center of the city. Binghamton High School, around the corner from the scene of the shootings, was locked down, and nearby apartment buildings were being evacuated, according to the newspaper. It quoted the mayor of Binghamton, Matthew Ryan, as saying the gunman had a high-powered rifle. The association describes itself on its Web site an organization that aids immigrants and refugees. \"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/nyregion/04hostage.html?hp\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

NORTH NAPLES: Deputies have identified the burglar shot to death by their intended victim Friday morning as a teenager who lived in the neighborhood.

Homeowner Sterling Misener, 44, heard an alarm and went out to the vehicle. Investigators say 19-year-old Patrick Allan Hutchison, of Wickliffe Drive, came out of the camper and lunged at Misener, who shot the teen. \"The homeowner shot the suspect after the suspect had lunged at him,\" said Michelle Batten of the Collier County Sheriff's Office. Deputies performed CPR on Hutchison until EMS arrived, but he died at the scene. The medical examiner's office removed the body from the driveway just before 8:30 a.m. Misener was not injured PS: Unfortunatly the homeowner used a sawed off shotgun. Which is illegal so it's not 100%. He may end up with a charge.",

The web site of the local newspaper, The Binghamton Press & Sun Bulletin, quoted the police there as saying that about 40 hostages were in the building. Shortly after noon, about 10 people were released from the building, the reports said, and about 40 minutes later another 10 were released. The Binghamton Police Department declined to provide details of the shootings, as officers and members of local SWAT teams surrounded the building, situated on a mixed commercial and residential strip on the west bank of the Chenango River near the center of the city. Binghamton High School, around the corner from the scene of the shootings, was locked down, and nearby apartment buildings were being evacuated, according to the newspaper.
