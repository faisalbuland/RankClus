That would be like Germany and Russia talking during world war II. Well I say Iraq wants us out then they need to step up and start using some of thier Air Force, Never mind they couldnt stop them if they tried. But they have to try or they will fall.

Heck neither of them like the Kurds. Plus once we leave Iraq needs to be able to swallow some pride and talk to their neighbors. The Iraqi Air Force? What Iraqi Air Force? It will be some years before they can defend against armed incursions in the air.",
