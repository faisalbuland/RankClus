Excuse me but I have been paying into SS since I was 15 years old and they just drop kicked me out the door. I couldn't hold down a job and even wound up in jail because I was a mental case. Too violent they said. I had to couch surf for 6 months or so before the VA got around to helping me. Now they are just handing it out to anyone even if you ran a paper clip through your finger....Bull Crap!!!",

They are the ones that need the money, not me. I need very little to survive on and I am grateful that to have a roof over my head. There isn't much else in life I need to keep me happy....
