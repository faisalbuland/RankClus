        "quote": "Originally posted by gsuchey: I USED to be a baseball fan. I USED to love to go to a game with my Dad when I was younger. Every time I start to love the game again, the players pull another strike out of their collective arses and stop the season. How many times in the last 20 years? All because they love money more than playing the game. Now I can't afford to take my family (wife and 2 daughters) to a game. The worst part of all of it is that last year their was talk in the wind of putting games on Pay-per-view. You've GOT to be kidding!! They want their money one way or the other apparantly. I've personally lost interest in watching.",

So to answer your question, the Cubs (as far as I know) played at Yankee Stadium when they lost the 1932 and the 1938 World Series to the Yanks. The Yankees took both series 4 games to zip. So while the Cubs have played there it appears as though they have never won a game at the stadium.
