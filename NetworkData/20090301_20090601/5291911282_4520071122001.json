For one thing, being \"bulked up\" causes some real problems for uniform requirements (20 inch neck and 30 inch thighs = uniforms like tents). Another thing is the PT and hiking requirements of the job. You got to jog/lug yourself around as well as all yer kit. Being bulked up is a real burden. I went in the Army at 5'8\" 190, came out 6 years later 158. Bulked back up to 220 after getting out, then went back in Air Force and fought the nightmare of height/weight requirements for 16 years, despite remaining about 5-8% body fat. Bottom Line: It's the military mission that must matter, not your combined Max. Mine was 1300 pounds (Bench Press, Squat, and Deadlift) and it never did me any good, except maybe when humping tank ammo, fixing a road wheel, or changing a track - - Wandering and Wondering",

Bulked back up to 220 after getting out, then went back in Air Force and fought the nightmare of height/weight requirements for 16 years, despite remaining about 5-8% body fat. Bottom Line: It's the military mission that must matter, not your combined Max.
