From CNN: quote: U.S.: Iran has material for nuclear bomb but still 'not close' (CNN) -- Iran likely has enough material to make a nuclear weapon, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told CNN's John King on Sunday. \"We think they do, quite frankly,\" Mullen said on \"State of the Union,\" when asked whether Iran \"might now have enough fissile material to make a bomb.\" \"Iran having a nuclear weapon, I believe, for a long time, is a very, very bad outcome for the region and for the world,\" Mullen added. A spokesman for Mullen later emphasized that Mullen was referring to \"low-grade\" material, and that to be used for a weapon, it would have to be highly enriched. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, speaking Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" said of Iran, \"They're not close to a stockpile, they're not close to a weapon at this point and so there is some time.\" Last week, Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee, \"We continue to assess Iran probably has imported at least some weapons-usable fissile material but still judge it has not obtained enough for a nuclear weapon.\" Mullen was traveling later Sunday and could not be reached immediately to clarify his statement. Tehran has denied pursuing nuclear weapons and insists the country's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Last month, a Washington think tank, the Institute for Science and International Security, released a report examining the latest data from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency. The institute concluded that Iran has reached \"nuclear weapons breakout capability.\" However, an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data, saying Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to qualify as weapons-grade material. That hasn't been done, the official said. Capt. John Kirby, Mullen's spokesman, told CNN Sunday, \"There are two components here: having enough and having it highly enriched.\" \"The chairman concurs Iran has enough low-enriched to produce a nuclear weapon, but it's important to note it's low-grade, and to enrich it would take time,\" Kirby said. Blair testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on February 12, before the latest report from the IAEA and the ISIS analysis. He repeated that testimony on Wednesday for the House committee. \"We cannot rule out that Iran has acquired from abroad or will acquire (...)",
