He is best known for his role in the Iraq War in 2003, and his inspirational eve-of-battle speech, a copy of which apparently hung in the White House's Oval Office. \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Collins_(British_Army_officer)\" The part that surprised me was his assertion about the diminished US view of UK armed forces. I'd never heard that before. Comments? -",

Since, if I heard correctly, his criticism was directed at the higher levels of command, not lower and mid-level soldiers and leaders, I guess the US criticism would have to come from somewhere around the 3-4 star level ... and one doesn't do that to one's allies.
