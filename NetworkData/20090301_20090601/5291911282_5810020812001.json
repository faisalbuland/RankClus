I listened for a moment or two than he wanted to confirm my address, date of birth and my place of birth. I lied and gave him my right home address but not my date and place of birth. He then connected me to a woman to confirm what info I just gave him. As she was talking I was actually reading a post on here. When she was through talking she asked me if I understood and I told her I was sorry that I was trying to listen to her and watch porn movies at the same time. I heard a loud click. I never hang up on these people. I always play with them to waste their time. To them time is money and to waste it for me is really fun. How about you all?",

We even got to keep our old land line number. The only problem is that I do computer repair and once in a while a computer comes in that still runs into a phone line.

Someone mentioned the \"watchtower\" people. We had a couple groups show up over the years. They were very neatly dressed and respectful. Never would they come in to the house, but sometimes they would accept a glass of water or tea. I figured that since they went to all the trouble of coming way out here, past the cows, braving the loose dogs...the least I could do is offer them a drink especially on those hot Texas summer days. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",
