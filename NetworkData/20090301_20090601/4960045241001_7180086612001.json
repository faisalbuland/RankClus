Smith describes these people as those who believe in \"obscure, discredited theories\" and \"operate and thrive on the fringe,\" and he liberally sprinkles his opinion-piece with pejoratives -- fringe; conspiracy theorists ; believers in UFOs and witches; wacko views; crazy, nutburger, demagogue, money-hungry, exploitative, irresponsible, filthy conservative imposters; the worst enemy of the conservative movement; crazy, demented, sick, troubled, and not suitable for civilized company. Smith's goal is to marginalize \"Birthers,\" and builds his case on three assumptions: 1. The challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence. 2. Courts across the country have summarily rejected the movement's theory -- that Obama can't be a citizen because his father wasn't -- as a misreading of U.S. la 3. Hawaii officials, along with contemporary birth announcements, affirm that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961. Lets' take a look at those statements: \"The challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence.\" False. That's a pretty broad brush -- by not qualifying \"challenges,\" Smith clearly implies that all of the challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence. The clearest evidence for a challenge comes from Obama himself, and it's the Hawaii Certification of Live Birth (COLB) released by the Obama campaign. Sandra Ramsey Lines began her training as a forensic document examiner in 1991. She is a Certified Diplomat of Forensic Sciences, a member of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, a member of the Southwestern Association of Forensic Document Examiners, and a member of the Questioned Document Subcommittee of the American Society of Testing and Materials. In a sworn affidavit, Ms. Lines wrote, \"After my review and based on my years of experience, I can state with certainty that the COLB presented on the internet by the various groups, which include the \"Daily Kos,\" the Obama Campaign, \"Factcheck.org\" and others cannot be relied upon as genuine.\" This is the document Obama's lawyers have pointed at as their evidence. Obama's own campaign website states: \"When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4,1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom\u2019s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.'s children. Since Sen. Obama has neither renounced his U.S. citizenship nor sworn an oath of allegiance to Kenya, his Kenyan citizenship automatically expired on Aug. 4,1982.\u201d Hello?? Obama admits he was a subject of Great Britain and a Citizen of Kenya for 21 years. Does the term, \"divided loyalties\" ring a bell? Judah Benjamin, an historian and former journalist, has written a two-part series challenging the Constitutionality of Barack Obama\u2019s eligibility to be President -- Part One -- Part Two. And, there's more EVIDENCE -- I don't know how much I'll put in here. \"Courts across the country have summarily rejected the movement's theory -- that Obama can't be a citizen because his father wasn't -- as a misreading of U.S. law.\" False. I guess Smith missed these two US Supreme Court cases -- U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, and Perkins v. Elg, -- both address \"natural born citizen\" -- and Obama fails both tests. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further, and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents [plural] within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the United States. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents [plural] AND born in the mainland of U.S. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents [plural] who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that. \"Hawaii officials, along with contemporary birth announcements, affirm that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" False. Hawaiian officials affirmed no such thing. Here is the statement of Linda Lingle, Hawaii's governor and Chiyome Leinaala ***ino, M.D., Director of the Hawaii Department of Health Director ***ino never affirmed \"that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" What she affirmed was, \" I have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" ***ino only says she saw the document -- she never, ever said what was on it. This statement is false, Smith. Take it back. There are hundreds of links in these pages that support the notion Smith rambles on, writing, \"the suits share a vague, underlying notion that Obama must be some sort of foreigner, probably Kenyan, Indonesian or British, though none have any evidence or a coherent narrative to support the claim.\" True: Mr. Smith click this link -- there's your evidence. Don't know where he pulled this one from -- Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve as POTUS. True. Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve. Chester A. Arthur perpetrated a fraud as to his eligibility to be Vice President by spreading various lies about his parents\u2019 heritage. Arthur\u2019s father, William Arthur, became a United States citizen in August 1843, but Arthur was born in 1829 -- 14 years before. T herefore, Arthur was a British Citizen by descent, and a dual citizen at birth, if not his whole life. We\u2019ve also uncovered many lies told by Arthur to the press which kept this fact from public view when he ran for Vice President in 1880. Garfield won the election, became President in 1881, and was assassinated by a fanatical Chester Arthur supporter that same year. Historical facts here. What Smith is really saying in his piece is that a large segment of the American people don't have a right to know if Obama is constitutionally eligible for the job? In his article, he writes that the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions, having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. The press aide once tasked with quashing viral rumors, Ben LaBolt, no longer follows the fringe. But lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court. Does Smith forget \"stonewalling?\" \"the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions,\" -- that's stonewalling -- right there! \"...having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. -- \"the official copy\" -- that's the one discredited by Ms. Lines and Dr. Polarik. \"...lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court -- 48 lawsuits -- maybe more -- and certainly more to come -- and they're being dismissed for standing -- not for lack of evidence -- it's a procedural thing -- none of the cases have been given a fair hearing. Smith manages to twist a legitimate, rational question into a pejorative, \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" -- but Smith, why IS \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" when he could release his vault-copy birth certificate for $12. Obama's California lawyer, Fredric Woocher, who was named \"Southern California Super Lawyer of 2009\" and gets $600 per hour claims he is working pro bono to prevent the release the president's records from Occidental College -- he has used the bullying tactic of threatening sanctions against the plaintiff's lawyer for pursuing the case. Obama has teams of lawyers, in a dozen states -- and the Democratic National Committee has a bunch -- an Occidental College has theirs -- why is that -- why is Obama fighting the release of his bona fides? I guess I'm a \"Birther\" -- I don't care about Smith's smear -- it is Smith who is attempting to defend the indefensible, and he's doing it by by labeling reasonable people, who hold views different than his, irrelevant. He's not doing it by presenting a cogent argument. If there's no there there, then why won't Obama release his bona fides. His refusal diminishes his believability and reinforces mine. What are you hiding, Obama?\" -- It's a legitimate question -- it deserves a full and complete answer. \"\"www.worldnetdaily.com\"\" This message has been edited.

        "content": "The Founders wanted the President to be a Natural Born Citizen to ensure that the ONE person sitting at the top of the Executive branch had UNQUESTIONABLE, UNWAVERING loyalty to the United States, first and foremost. At one point, the delegates writing the Constitution in 1787 considered THREE \"presidents\" in the Executive for \"checks and balances.\" They considered a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators as well. Debating those issues, they felt that a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators would limit the pool of possible candidates and could cause bad feelings with immigrants needed to \"jump start\" the newly-formed republic. In the end, the Framers compromised that Senators be required to be US residents for 9 years, while striking the \"natural born citizen\" clause for the office. The Framers also compromised on ONE Executive vs. THREE. But to ensure \"checks and balances,\" the Framers inserted in Art II, Sect. 1, Clause 5: \"No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President...\" The natural born citizen clause was NOT an accident, nor was it an inane rule to be restrictive to immigrants, and it certainly isn't just a \"political\" issue. Loyalty to the US is the reason the natural born citizen clause was inserted into the Constitution. In the official copies of the THIRD U.S. Congress (1795) margin notes state \"Former act repealed. 1790. ch. 3.\" referencing the FIRST U.S. Congress (1790). Document ONE: the actual text of the THIRD CONGRESS in 1795 states, \"...children of citizens [plural, i.e. two parents] of the United States...shall be considered citizens of the United States; Provided That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons, whose fathers have never been resident in the United States...\" (THIRD CONGRESS Sess.

John Bingham of Ohio, considered the father of the Fourteenth Amendment, confirms that understanding and the construction the framers used in regards to birthright and jurisdiction while speaking on civil rights of citizens in the House on March 9, 1866: \" ... I find no fault with the introductory clause [S 61 Bill], which is simply declaratory of what is written in the Constitution, that every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents (plural, meaning two) not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural born citizen...\" John Bingham Bingham is also quoted saying in the Spring of 1868 some serious warnings: \"May God forbid that the future historian shall record of this day's proceedings, that by reason of the failure of the legislative power of the people to triumph over the usurpations of an apostate President, the fabric of American empire fell and perished from the earth!... I ask you to consider that we stand this day pleading for the violated majesty of the law, by the graves of half a million of martyred hero-patriots who made death beautiful by the sacrifice of themselves for their country, the Constitution and the laws, and who, by their sublime example, have taught us all to obey the law; that none are above the law...\" 14th Amendment The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution is one of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments, first intended to secure the rights of former slaves. It was proposed on June 13, 1866, and ratified on July 9, 1868. The amendment provides a broad definition of citizenship, overruling Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) which had excluded slaves and their descendants from possessing Constitutional rights. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The 14th Amendment does not address the \"natural born citizen\" issue, only citizenship. U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark's importance is that it is the first case decided by the Supreme Court that attempts to explain the meaning of \"natural born citizen\" under Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. Natural born citizen is similar to the meaning of what a natural born subject is under Common Law in England. That is one of the reasons why the framers specifically included a grandfather clause (natural born Citizen OR a Citizen of the United States, at the time of adoption of this Constitution). The founding fathers knew that in order to be president, they had to grandfather themselves in because they were British subjects. If they didn't, they could not be President of the U.S. The holding in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark states that Wong Kim Ark is a native born citizen. If you look at the fact of Wong Kim Ark being born in San Francisco, CA, of Chinese parents, that holding is correct. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further, and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the U. S. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents AND born in the mainland of U.S. Citizen: On cross appeals, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 69 App.D.C. 175, 99 F.2d 408. Certiorari was granted, December 5, 1938, 305 U.S. 591, 59 S.Ct. 245, 83 L.Ed. --. First.-- On her birth in New York, the plaintiff became a citizen of the United States. Civil Rights Act of 1866: Ms. Elg was found to be a \"citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) Native Born citizen: This principle was clearly stated by Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont in his letter of advice to the Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, in Steinkauler's Case, 1875, 15 Op.Atty.Gen. 15. The facts were these: One Steinkauler, a Prussian subject by birth, emigrated to the United States in 1848, was naturalized in 1854, and in the following year had a son who was born in St. Louis. Four years later Steinkauler returned to Germany taking this child and became domiciled at Weisbaden where they continuously resided. When the son reached the age of twenty years the German Government called upon him to report for military duty and his father then invoked the intervention of the American Legation on the ground that his son was a native citizen of the United States. To an inquiry by our Minister, the father declined to give an assurance that the son would return to this country within a reasonable time. On reviewing the pertinent points in the case, including the Naturalization Treaty of 1868 with North Germany, 15 Stat. 615, the Attorney General reached the following conclusion: 'Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. Mr. Steinkauler was found to be a \"native born citizen\" because he was born in the mainland USA (St. Louis) Natural Born Citizen: U. S. Supreme Court's Relevant Facts: Miss Elg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1907. Her parents, who were natives of Sweden, emigrated to the United States sometime prior to 1906 and her father was naturalized here in that year. In 1911, her mother took her to Sweden where she continued to reside until September 7, 1929. Her father went to Sweden in 1922 and has not since returned to the United States. In November, 1934, he made a statement before an American consul in Sweden that he had voluntarily expatriated himself for the reason that he did not desire to retain the status of an American citizen and wished to preserve his allegiance to Sweden. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 327 (1939).] U. S. Supreme Court's Holding: The court below, properly recognizing the existence of an actual controversy with the defendants (Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617, 108 A.L.R. 1000) declared Miss Elg 'to be a natural born citizen of the United States' (99 F.2d 414) and we think that the decree should include the Secretary of State as well as the other defendants. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 350 (1939).] Rationale of the logic is as follows: The U. S. Supreme Court in 1939 held that Elg was a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN because she was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 2, 1907, her father was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1906 under the Naturalization Act of 1906, and her mother derived her US citizenship in 1907 under the Expatriation Act of 1907. The Expatriation Act of 1907 extended the logic linking a woman's citizenship to her marital status and the status of her spouse. Ms. Elg was found to be a \"natural born citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) of TWO US citizen parents. You can be a \"citizen\" under the following circumstances: 1. You were born of one citizen parent (Obama), or 2. You were born in the US mainland (anchor babies -- DEL), or 3. You were naturalized (Schwarzenegger). To be a \"natural born citizen\" you must be born in the US mainland of two US parents. Elg's Mother derived US citizenship when her father was naturalized. This was automatic -- it's called derivative citizenship. These are the forms of derivative citizenship that were effective due to federal statute at the time Elg was born: 1. An alien woman obtained automatic US citizenship when she married a US citizen male. 2. An alien woman obtained automatic us citizenship when her alien husband became naturalized. So, in 1907 when Elg was born on US soil, both of her parents were US citizens, therefore she was a \"natural born citizen.\" Funny thing is, when the US Supreme Court decided the case, the derivative citizen laws had changed, however, they retroactively applied them... because they had to. They had to use the law at the time of Elg's birth... because that's when she was born, hence she was a natural born citizen at the time of her birth and nothing could change that. All U. S. military personal and every other American under oath to protect and defend the U. S. Constitution will be duty bound to remove the fraudulent usurper. This situation is REGARDLESS of votes, electors, media blackouts, high profile embarrassments, state court decisions, supreme court actions or inaction, birth certificates real or forged, or any other documents -- Obama can NOT LEGALLY BE The US President. No documentation is required. Everyone should understand and KNOW the answer to the question of what country is the country of which Obama was a natural born citizen. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Barry Obama, Barry Soetoro, or Barack Hussein Obama II, to be a natural born United States citizen. Obama can NOT POSSIBLY be a \"natural born citizen\" of the U. S. because his father, Barack Hussein Obama Senior, was a subject of Great Britain and a citizen of Kenya. He was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed Obama's status until he was 21 years of age. Kenya\u2019s Constitution specifies that at age 21, Kenyan citizens who possesses citizenship in more than one country automatically lose their Kenyan citizenship unless they formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya. Whether Obama was born in Hawaii, Kenya, or the moon, is irrelevant. Birth documents, real or forged, are irrelevant. Yes, even VOTES ARE IRRELEVANT. Even Supreme Court action, or inaction, is irrelevant. It is simply FRAUD and illegal for Obama to be put in the office of U. S. President by any means or reason. Obama is at the epicenter of the greatest national disaster in the history of the United States. NOTHING that Obama would ever do in the office of U. S. President could ever be anything other than FRAUD and ILLEGAL. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that.",

        "reply": "The Founders wanted the President to be a Natural Born Citizen to ensure that the ONE person sitting at the top of the Executive branch had UNQUESTIONABLE, UNWAVERING loyalty to the United States, first and foremost. At one point, the delegates writing the Constitution in 1787 considered THREE \"presidents\" in the Executive for \"checks and balances.\" They considered a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators as well. Debating those issues, they felt that a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators would limit the pool of possible candidates and could cause bad feelings with immigrants needed to \"jump start\" the newly-formed republic. In the end, the Framers compromised that Senators be required to be US residents for 9 years, while striking the \"natural born citizen\" clause for the office. The Framers also compromised on ONE Executive vs. THREE. But to ensure \"checks and balances,\" the Framers inserted in Art II, Sect. 1, Clause 5: \"No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President...\" The natural born citizen clause was NOT an accident, nor was it an inane rule to be restrictive to immigrants, and it certainly isn't just a \"political\" issue. Loyalty to the US is the reason the natural born citizen clause was inserted into the Constitution.

No, you are incorrect. The people spoke their voice on November 4, 2008. They spoke their \"majority\" voice loud and clear! By both the Electoral College and the Popular Vote, Barack Obama became the 44th President of The United States. Both Houses of Congress (Democratic) were elected by majority vote as well. The people (as the government) have spoken, as to who they wish to govern this country in the nation's capital. Those who have been elected to public office are our chosen representatives. Yes, it is that simple! Now, if you want to call the duly elected President of the United States a traitor, then by all means friend, you go right ahead! We'll see how far that one gets you! Yes, Jefferson did indeed speak those words you cite. However, we, the USA are not in a sinking ship at sea. We are in several crisis situations at home and aborad, however only \"WE\" as the collective body of American citizens, represented by our duly elected government, can fix our ailments. If you and your lemmings are so distraught by the \"duly elected federal govt.,\" then by all means, have your march on Washington with your intent (the blood of patriots and tyrants) and get your civil insurrection going! If you're all that damn serious, then hurry up and fire your first shot! But I think you won't do that. I think you people are nothing more, than wind and smoke! And there is plenty enough hot air, to go around on these forums....

        "content": "Internet reports mock 'Birthers' who want constitutional proof poll, AOL is asking readers: \u201cDo you have any doubt about Obama\u2019s eligibility to be president because of his birth status?\u201d AOL News brought \"Birthers\" to the mainstream when they published a small piece referencing Ben Smith's Politico.com report, \"Culture of conspiracy: the Birthers\" -- those who question Obama's eligibility to serve as commander-in-chief because of his birth and/or citizenship status. Smith describes these people as those who believe in \"obscure, discredited theories\" and \"operate and thrive on the fringe,\" and he liberally sprinkles his opinion-piece with pejoratives -- fringe; conspiracy theorists ; believers in UFOs and witches; wacko views; crazy, nutburger, demagogue, money-hungry, exploitative, irresponsible, filthy conservative imposters; the worst enemy of the conservative movement; crazy, demented, sick, troubled, and not suitable for civilized company. Smith's goal is to marginalize \"Birthers,\" and builds his case on three assumptions: 1. The challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence. 2. Courts across the country have summarily rejected the movement's theory -- that Obama can't be a citizen because his father wasn't -- as a misreading of U.S. la 3. Hawaii officials, along with contemporary birth announcements, affirm that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961. Lets' take a look at those statements: \"The challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence.\" False. That's a pretty broad brush -- by not qualifying \"challenges,\" Smith clearly implies that all of the challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence. The clearest evidence for a challenge comes from Obama himself, and it's the Hawaii Certification of Live Birth (COLB) released by the Obama campaign. Sandra Ramsey Lines began her training as a forensic document examiner in 1991. She is a Certified Diplomat of Forensic Sciences, a member of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, a member of the Southwestern Association of Forensic Document Examiners, and a member of the Questioned Document Subcommittee of the American Society of Testing and Materials. In a sworn affidavit, Ms. Lines wrote, \"After my review and based on my years of experience, I can state with certainty that the COLB presented on the internet by the various groups, which include the \"Daily Kos,\" the Obama Campaign, \"Factcheck.org\" and others cannot be relied upon as genuine.\" This is the document Obama's lawyers have pointed at as their evidence. Obama's own campaign website states: \"When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4,1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom\u2019s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.'s children. Since Sen. Obama has neither renounced his U.S. citizenship nor sworn an oath of allegiance to Kenya, his Kenyan citizenship automatically expired on Aug. 4,1982.\u201d Hello?? Obama admits he was a subject of Great Britain and a Citizen of Kenya for 21 years. Does the term, \"divided loyalties\" ring a bell? Judah Benjamin, an historian and former journalist, has written a two-part series challenging the Constitutionality of Barack Obama\u2019s eligibility to be President -- Part One -- Part Two. And, there's more EVIDENCE -- I don't know how much I'll put in here. \"Courts across the country have summarily rejected the movement's theory -- that Obama can't be a citizen because his father wasn't -- as a misreading of U.S. law.\" False. I guess Smith missed these two US Supreme Court cases -- U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, and Perkins v. Elg, -- both address \"natural born citizen\" -- and Obama fails both tests. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further, and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents [plural] within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the United States. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents [plural] AND born in the mainland of U.S. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents [plural] who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that. \"Hawaii officials, along with contemporary birth announcements, affirm that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" False. Hawaiian officials affirmed no such thing. Here is the statement of Linda Lingle, Hawaii's governor and Chiyome Leinaala ***ino, M.D., Director of the Hawaii Department of Health Director ***ino never affirmed \"that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" What she affirmed was, \" I have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" ***ino only says she saw the document -- she never, ever said what was on it. This statement is false, Smith. Take it back. There are hundreds of links in these pages that support the notion Smith rambles on, writing, \"the suits share a vague, underlying notion that Obama must be some sort of foreigner, probably Kenyan, Indonesian or British, though none have any evidence or a coherent narrative to support the claim.\" True: Mr. Smith click this link -- there's your evidence. Don't know where he pulled this one from -- Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve as POTUS. True. Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve. Chester A. Arthur perpetrated a fraud as to his eligibility to be Vice President by spreading various lies about his parents\u2019 heritage. Arthur\u2019s father, William Arthur, became a United States citizen in August 1843, but Arthur was born in 1829 -- 14 years before. T herefore, Arthur was a British Citizen by descent, and a dual citizen at birth, if not his whole life. We\u2019ve also uncovered many lies told by Arthur to the press which kept this fact from public view when he ran for Vice President in 1880. Garfield won the election, became President in 1881, and was assassinated by a fanatical Chester Arthur supporter that same year. Historical facts here. What Smith is really saying in his piece is that a large segment of the American people don't have a right to know if Obama is constitutionally eligible for the job? In his article, he writes that the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions, having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. The press aide once tasked with quashing viral rumors, Ben LaBolt, no longer follows the fringe. But lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court. Does Smith forget \"stonewalling?\" \"the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions,\" -- that's stonewalling -- right there! \"...having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. -- \"the official copy\" -- that's the one discredited by Ms. Lines and Dr. Polarik. \"...lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court -- 48 lawsuits -- maybe more -- and certainly more to come -- and they're being dismissed for standing -- not for lack of evidence -- it's a procedural thing -- none of the cases have been given a fair hearing. Smith manages to twist a legitimate, rational question into a pejorative, \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" -- but Smith, why IS \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" when he could release his vault-copy birth certificate for $12. Obama's California lawyer, Fredric Woocher, who was named \"Southern California Super Lawyer of 2009\" and gets $600 per hour claims he is working pro bono to prevent the release the president's records from Occidental College -- he has used the bullying tactic of threatening sanctions against the plaintiff's lawyer for pursuing the case. Obama has teams of lawyers, in a dozen states -- and the Democratic National Committee has a bunch -- an Occidental College has theirs -- why is that -- why is Obama fighting the release of his bona fides? I guess I'm a \"Birther\" -- I don't care about Smith's smear -- it is Smith who is attempting to defend the indefensible, and he's doing it by by labeling reasonable people, who hold views different than his, irrelevant. He's not doing it by presenting a cogent argument. If there's no there there, then why won't Obama release his bona fides. His refusal diminishes his believability and reinforces mine. What are you hiding, Obama?\" -- It's a legitimate question -- it deserves a full and complete answer. \"\"www.worldnetdaily.com\"\" This message has been edited.

Obama's own campaign website states: \"When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4,1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom\u2019s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.'s children. Since Sen. Obama has neither renounced his U.S. citizenship nor sworn an oath of allegiance to Kenya, his Kenyan citizenship automatically expired on Aug. 4,1982.\u201d Hello?? Obama admits he was a subject of Great Britain and a Citizen of Kenya for 21 years. Does the term, \"divided loyalties\" ring a bell? Judah Benjamin, an historian and former journalist, has written a two-part series challenging the Constitutionality of Barack Obama\u2019s eligibility to be President -- Part One -- Part Two. And, there's more EVIDENCE -- I don't know how much I'll put in here. \"Courts across the country have summarily rejected the movement's theory -- that Obama can't be a citizen because his father wasn't -- as a misreading of U.S. law.\" False. I guess Smith missed these two US Supreme Court cases -- U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, and Perkins v. Elg, -- both address \"natural born citizen\" -- and Obama fails both tests. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further, and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents [plural] within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the United States. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents [plural] AND born in the mainland of U.S. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents [plural] who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that. \"Hawaii officials, along with contemporary birth announcements, affirm that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" False. Hawaiian officials affirmed no such thing. Here is the statement of Linda Lingle, Hawaii's governor and Chiyome Leinaala ***ino, M.D., Director of the Hawaii Department of Health Director ***ino never affirmed \"that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" What she affirmed was, \" I have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" ***ino only says she saw the document -- she never, ever said what was on it. This statement is false, Smith. Take it back. There are hundreds of links in these pages that support the notion Smith rambles on, writing, \"the suits share a vague, underlying notion that Obama must be some sort of foreigner, probably Kenyan, Indonesian or British, though none have any evidence or a coherent narrative to support the claim.\" True: Mr. Smith click this link -- there's your evidence. Don't know where he pulled this one from -- Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve as POTUS. True. Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve. Chester A. Arthur perpetrated a fraud as to his eligibility to be Vice President by spreading various lies about his parents\u2019 heritage. Arthur\u2019s father, William Arthur, became a United States citizen in August 1843, but Arthur was born in 1829 -- 14 years before. T herefore, Arthur was a British Citizen by descent, and a dual citizen at birth, if not his whole life. We\u2019ve also uncovered many lies told by Arthur to the press which kept this fact from public view when he ran for Vice President in 1880. Garfield won the election, became President in 1881, and was assassinated by a fanatical Chester Arthur supporter that same year. Historical facts here. What Smith is really saying in his piece is that a large segment of the American people don't have a right to know if Obama is constitutionally eligible for the job? In his article, he writes that the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions, having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. The press aide once tasked with quashing viral rumors, Ben LaBolt, no longer follows the fringe. But lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court. Does Smith forget \"stonewalling?\" \"the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions,\" -- that's stonewalling -- right there! \"...having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. -- \"the official copy\" -- that's the one discredited by Ms. Lines and Dr. Polarik. \"...lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court -- 48 lawsuits -- maybe more -- and certainly more to come -- and they're being dismissed for standing -- not for lack of evidence -- it's a procedural thing -- none of the cases have been given a fair hearing. Smith manages to twist a legitimate, rational question into a pejorative, \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" -- but Smith, why IS \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" when he could release his vault-copy birth certificate for $12. Obama's California lawyer, Fredric Woocher, who was named \"Southern California Super Lawyer of 2009\" and gets $600 per hour claims he is working pro bono to prevent the release the president's records from Occidental College -- he has used the bullying tactic of threatening sanctions against the plaintiff's lawyer for pursuing the case. Obama has teams of lawyers, in a dozen states -- and the Democratic National Committee has a bunch -- an Occidental College has theirs -- why is that -- why is Obama fighting the release of his bona fides? I guess I'm a \"Birther\" -- I don't care about Smith's smear -- it is Smith who is attempting to defend the indefensible, and he's doing it by by labeling reasonable people, who hold views different than his, irrelevant. He's not doing it by presenting a cogent argument. If there's no there there, then why won't Obama release his bona fides. His refusal diminishes his believability and reinforces mine. What are you hiding, Obama?\" -- It's a legitimate question -- it deserves a full and complete answer. \"\"www.worldnetdaily.com\"\" This message has been edited.

        "content": "The Founders wanted the President to be a Natural Born Citizen to ensure that the ONE person sitting at the top of the Executive branch had UNQUESTIONABLE, UNWAVERING loyalty to the United States, first and foremost. At one point, the delegates writing the Constitution in 1787 considered THREE \"presidents\" in the Executive for \"checks and balances.\" They considered a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators as well. Debating those issues, they felt that a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators would limit the pool of possible candidates and could cause bad feelings with immigrants needed to \"jump start\" the newly-formed republic. In the end, the Framers compromised that Senators be required to be US residents for 9 years, while striking the \"natural born citizen\" clause for the office. The Framers also compromised on ONE Executive vs. THREE. But to ensure \"checks and balances,\" the Framers inserted in Art II, Sect. 1, Clause 5: \"No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President...\" The natural born citizen clause was NOT an accident, nor was it an inane rule to be restrictive to immigrants, and it certainly isn't just a \"political\" issue. Loyalty to the US is the reason the natural born citizen clause was inserted into the Constitution. In the official copies of the THIRD U.S. Congress (1795) margin notes state \"Former act repealed. 1790. ch. 3.\" referencing the FIRST U.S. Congress (1790). Document ONE: the actual text of the THIRD CONGRESS in 1795 states, \"...children of citizens [plural, i.e. two parents] of the United States...shall be considered citizens of the United States; Provided That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons, whose fathers have never been resident in the United States...\" (THIRD CONGRESS Sess. II. Ch.21. 1795, Approved January 29, 1795, pp. 414-415. Document margin note: \"How children shall obtain citizenship through their parents\" Document margin note: \"Former Act repealed 1790 ch.3.\") See Attachment A. Document TWO: the actual text of the FIRST CONGRESS in 1790 states, \"...children of citizens (NB: plural, i.e. two parents) of the United States...shall be considered as natural born citizens of the United States; Provided That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons, whose fathers have never been resident in the United States...\" (FIRST CONGRESS Sess. II Ch.4 1790, Approved March 26, 1790, pp. 103-104. Document margin note: \"Their children residing here, deemed citizens.\" Document margin note: \"Also, children of citizens born beyond sea, & c. Exceptions.\") See Attachment B. Document THREE: the actual text of the Constitution from the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, 1774-1789, and subsequent official printings, of the Constitution of the United States of American: Article II Section 1 Clause 5 states, \"No person, except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President\u2026\" Rep. John Bingham of Ohio, considered the father of the Fourteenth Amendment, confirms that understanding and the construction the framers used in regards to birthright and jurisdiction while speaking on civil rights of citizens in the House on March 9, 1866: \" ... I find no fault with the introductory clause [S 61 Bill], which is simply declaratory of what is written in the Constitution, that every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents (plural, meaning two) not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural born citizen...\" John Bingham Bingham is also quoted saying in the Spring of 1868 some serious warnings: \"May God forbid that the future historian shall record of this day's proceedings, that by reason of the failure of the legislative power of the people to triumph over the usurpations of an apostate President, the fabric of American empire fell and perished from the earth!... I ask you to consider that we stand this day pleading for the violated majesty of the law, by the graves of half a million of martyred hero-patriots who made death beautiful by the sacrifice of themselves for their country, the Constitution and the laws, and who, by their sublime example, have taught us all to obey the law; that none are above the law...\" 14th Amendment The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution is one of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments, first intended to secure the rights of former slaves. It was proposed on June 13, 1866, and ratified on July 9, 1868. The amendment provides a broad definition of citizenship, overruling Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) which had excluded slaves and their descendants from possessing Constitutional rights. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The 14th Amendment does not address the \"natural born citizen\" issue, only citizenship. U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark's importance is that it is the first case decided by the Supreme Court that attempts to explain the meaning of \"natural born citizen\" under Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. Natural born citizen is similar to the meaning of what a natural born subject is under Common Law in England. That is one of the reasons why the framers specifically included a grandfather clause (natural born Citizen OR a Citizen of the United States, at the time of adoption of this Constitution). The founding fathers knew that in order to be president, they had to grandfather themselves in because they were British subjects. If they didn't, they could not be President of the U.S. The holding in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark states that Wong Kim Ark is a native born citizen. If you look at the fact of Wong Kim Ark being born in San Francisco, CA, of Chinese parents, that holding is correct. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also.

As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the U. S. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents AND born in the mainland of U.S. Citizen: On cross appeals, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 69 App.D.C. 175, 99 F.2d 408. Certiorari was granted, December 5, 1938, 305 U.S. 591, 59 S.Ct. 245, 83 L.Ed. --. First.-- On her birth in New York, the plaintiff became a citizen of the United States. Civil Rights Act of 1866: Ms. Elg was found to be a \"citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) Native Born citizen: This principle was clearly stated by Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont in his letter of advice to the Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, in Steinkauler's Case, 1875, 15 Op.Atty.Gen. 15. The facts were these: One Steinkauler, a Prussian subject by birth, emigrated to the United States in 1848, was naturalized in 1854, and in the following year had a son who was born in St. Louis. Four years later Steinkauler returned to Germany taking this child and became domiciled at Weisbaden where they continuously resided. When the son reached the age of twenty years the German Government called upon him to report for military duty and his father then invoked the intervention of the American Legation on the ground that his son was a native citizen of the United States. To an inquiry by our Minister, the father declined to give an assurance that the son would return to this country within a reasonable time. On reviewing the pertinent points in the case, including the Naturalization Treaty of 1868 with North Germany, 15 Stat. 615, the Attorney General reached the following conclusion: 'Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. Mr. Steinkauler was found to be a \"native born citizen\" because he was born in the mainland USA (St. Louis) Natural Born Citizen: U. S. Supreme Court's Relevant Facts: Miss Elg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1907. Her parents, who were natives of Sweden, emigrated to the United States sometime prior to 1906 and her father was naturalized here in that year. In 1911, her mother took her to Sweden where she continued to reside until September 7, 1929. Her father went to Sweden in 1922 and has not since returned to the United States. In November, 1934, he made a statement before an American consul in Sweden that he had voluntarily expatriated himself for the reason that he did not desire to retain the status of an American citizen and wished to preserve his allegiance to Sweden. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 327 (1939).] U. S. Supreme Court's Holding: The court below, properly recognizing the existence of an actual controversy with the defendants (Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617, 108 A.L.R. 1000) declared Miss Elg 'to be a natural born citizen of the United States' (99 F.2d 414) and we think that the decree should include the Secretary of State as well as the other defendants. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 350 (1939).] Rationale of the logic is as follows: The U. S. Supreme Court in 1939 held that Elg was a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN because she was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 2, 1907, her father was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1906 under the Naturalization Act of 1906, and her mother derived her US citizenship in 1907 under the Expatriation Act of 1907. The Expatriation Act of 1907 extended the logic linking a woman's citizenship to her marital status and the status of her spouse. Ms. Elg was found to be a \"natural born citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) of TWO US citizen parents. You can be a \"citizen\" under the following circumstances: 1. You were born of one citizen parent (Obama), or 2. You were born in the US mainland (anchor babies -- DEL), or 3. You were naturalized (Schwarzenegger). To be a \"natural born citizen\" you must be born in the US mainland of two US parents. Elg's Mother derived US citizenship when her father was naturalized. This was automatic -- it's called derivative citizenship. These are the forms of derivative citizenship that were effective due to federal statute at the time Elg was born: 1. An alien woman obtained automatic US citizenship when she married a US citizen male. 2. An alien woman obtained automatic us citizenship when her alien husband became naturalized. So, in 1907 when Elg was born on US soil, both of her parents were US citizens, therefore she was a \"natural born citizen.\" Funny thing is, when the US Supreme Court decided the case, the derivative citizen laws had changed, however, they retroactively applied them... because they had to. They had to use the law at the time of Elg's birth... because that's when she was born, hence she was a natural born citizen at the time of her birth and nothing could change that. All U. S. military personal and every other American under oath to protect and defend the U. S. Constitution will be duty bound to remove the fraudulent usurper. This situation is REGARDLESS of votes, electors, media blackouts, high profile embarrassments, state court decisions, supreme court actions or inaction, birth certificates real or forged, or any other documents -- Obama can NOT LEGALLY BE The US President. No documentation is required. Everyone should understand and KNOW the answer to the question of what country is the country of which Obama was a natural born citizen. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Barry Obama, Barry Soetoro, or Barack Hussein Obama II, to be a natural born United States citizen. Obama can NOT POSSIBLY be a \"natural born citizen\" of the U. S. because his father, Barack Hussein Obama Senior, was a subject of Great Britain and a citizen of Kenya. He was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed Obama's status until he was 21 years of age. Kenya\u2019s Constitution specifies that at age 21, Kenyan citizens who possesses citizenship in more than one country automatically lose their Kenyan citizenship unless they formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya. Whether Obama was born in Hawaii, Kenya, or the moon, is irrelevant. Birth documents, real or forged, are irrelevant. Yes, even VOTES ARE IRRELEVANT. Even Supreme Court action, or inaction, is irrelevant. It is simply FRAUD and illegal for Obama to be put in the office of U. S. President by any means or reason. Obama is at the epicenter of the greatest national disaster in the history of the United States. NOTHING that Obama would ever do in the office of U. S. President could ever be anything other than FRAUD and ILLEGAL. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that.",

        "reply": "The Founders wanted the President to be a Natural Born Citizen to ensure that the ONE person sitting at the top of the Executive branch had UNQUESTIONABLE, UNWAVERING loyalty to the United States, first and foremost. At one point, the delegates writing the Constitution in 1787 considered THREE \"presidents\" in the Executive for \"checks and balances.\" They considered a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators as well. Debating those issues, they felt that a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators would limit the pool of possible candidates and could cause bad feelings with immigrants needed to \"jump start\" the newly-formed republic. In the end, the Framers compromised that Senators be required to be US residents for 9 years, while striking the \"natural born citizen\" clause for the office. The Framers also compromised on ONE Executive vs. THREE. But to ensure \"checks and balances,\" the Framers inserted in Art II, Sect. 1, Clause 5: \"No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President...\" The natural born citizen clause was NOT an accident, nor was it an inane rule to be restrictive to immigrants, and it certainly isn't just a \"political\" issue. Loyalty to the US is the reason the natural born citizen clause was inserted into the Constitution. In the official copies of the THIRD U.S. Congress (1795) margin notes state \"Former act repealed. 1790. ch. 3.\" referencing the FIRST U.S. Congress (1790). Document ONE: the actual text of the THIRD CONGRESS in 1795 states, \"...children of citizens [plural, i.e. two parents] of the United States...shall be considered citizens of the United States; Provided That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons, whose fathers have never been resident in the United States...\" (THIRD CONGRESS Sess. II. Ch.21. 1795, Approved January 29, 1795, pp. 414-415. Document margin note: \"How children shall obtain citizenship through their parents\" Document margin note: \"Former Act repealed 1790 ch.3.\") See Attachment A. Document TWO: the actual text of the FIRST CONGRESS in 1790 states, \"...children of citizens (NB: plural, i.e. two parents) of the United States...shall be considered as natural born citizens of the United States; Provided That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons, whose fathers have never been resident in the United States...\" (FIRST CONGRESS Sess. II Ch.4 1790, Approved March 26, 1790, pp. 103-104. Document margin note: \"Their children residing here, deemed citizens.\" Document margin note: \"Also, children of citizens born beyond sea, & c. Exceptions.\") See Attachment B. Document THREE: the actual text of the Constitution from the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, 1774-1789, and subsequent official printings, of the Constitution of the United States of American: Article II Section 1 Clause 5 states, \"No person, except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President\u2026\" Rep. John Bingham of Ohio, considered the father of the Fourteenth Amendment, confirms that understanding and the construction the framers used in regards to birthright and jurisdiction while speaking on civil rights of citizens in the House on March 9, 1866: \" ... I find no fault with the introductory clause [S 61 Bill], which is simply declaratory of what is written in the Constitution, that every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents (plural, meaning two) not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural born citizen...\" John Bingham Bingham is also quoted saying in the Spring of 1868 some serious warnings: \"May God forbid that the future historian shall record of this day's proceedings, that by reason of the failure of the legislative power of the people to triumph over the usurpations of an apostate President, the fabric of American empire fell and perished from the earth!... I ask you to consider that we stand this day pleading for the violated majesty of the law, by the graves of half a million of martyred hero-patriots who made death beautiful by the sacrifice of themselves for their country, the Constitution and the laws, and who, by their sublime example, have taught us all to obey the law; that none are above the law...\" 14th Amendment The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution is one of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments, first intended to secure the rights of former slaves. It was proposed on June 13, 1866, and ratified on July 9, 1868. The amendment provides a broad definition of citizenship, overruling Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) which had excluded slaves and their descendants from possessing Constitutional rights. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The 14th Amendment does not address the \"natural born citizen\" issue, only citizenship. U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark's importance is that it is the first case decided by the Supreme Court that attempts to explain the meaning of \"natural born citizen\" under Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. Natural born citizen is similar to the meaning of what a natural born subject is under Common Law in England. That is one of the reasons why the framers specifically included a grandfather clause (natural born Citizen OR a Citizen of the United States, at the time of adoption of this Constitution). The founding fathers knew that in order to be president, they had to grandfather themselves in because they were British subjects. If they didn't, they could not be President of the U.S. The holding in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark states that Wong Kim Ark is a native born citizen. If you look at the fact of Wong Kim Ark being born in San Francisco, CA, of Chinese parents, that holding is correct. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further, and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the U. S. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents AND born in the mainland of U.S. Citizen: On cross appeals, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 69 App.D.C. 175, 99 F.2d 408. Certiorari was granted, December 5, 1938, 305 U.S. 591, 59 S.Ct. 245, 83 L.Ed. --. First.-- On her birth in New York, the plaintiff became a citizen of the United States. Civil Rights Act of 1866: Ms. Elg was found to be a \"citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) Native Born citizen: This principle was clearly stated by Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont in his letter of advice to the Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, in Steinkauler's Case, 1875, 15 Op.Atty.Gen. 15. The facts were these: One Steinkauler, a Prussian subject by birth, emigrated to the United States in 1848, was naturalized in 1854, and in the following year had a son who was born in St. Louis. Four years later Steinkauler returned to Germany taking this child and became domiciled at Weisbaden where they continuously resided. When the son reached the age of twenty years the German Government called upon him to report for military duty and his father then invoked the intervention of the American Legation on the ground that his son was a native citizen of the United States. To an inquiry by our Minister, the father declined to give an assurance that the son would return to this country within a reasonable time. On reviewing the pertinent points in the case, including the Naturalization Treaty of 1868 with North Germany, 15 Stat. 615, the Attorney General reached the following conclusion: 'Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. Mr. Steinkauler was found to be a \"native born citizen\" because he was born in the mainland USA (St. Louis) Natural Born Citizen: U. S. Supreme Court's Relevant Facts: Miss Elg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1907. Her parents, who were natives of Sweden, emigrated to the United States sometime prior to 1906 and her father was naturalized here in that year. In 1911, her mother took her to Sweden where she continued to reside until September 7, 1929. Her father went to Sweden in 1922 and has not since returned to the United States. In November, 1934, he made a statement before an American consul in Sweden that he had voluntarily expatriated himself for the reason that he did not desire to retain the status of an American citizen and wished to preserve his allegiance to Sweden. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 327 (1939).] U. S. Supreme Court's Holding: The court below, properly recognizing the existence of an actual controversy with the defendants (Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617, 108 A.L.R. 1000) declared Miss Elg 'to be a natural born citizen of the United States' (99 F.2d 414) and we think that the decree should include the Secretary of State as well as the other defendants. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 350 (1939).] Rationale of the logic is as follows: The U. S. Supreme Court in 1939 held that Elg was a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN because she was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 2, 1907, her father was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1906 under the Naturalization Act of 1906, and her mother derived her US citizenship in 1907 under the Expatriation Act of 1907. The Expatriation Act of 1907 extended the logic linking a woman's citizenship to her marital status and the status of her spouse. Ms. Elg was found to be a \"natural born citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) of TWO US citizen parents. You can be a \"citizen\" under the following circumstances: 1. You were born of one citizen parent (Obama), or 2. You were born in the US mainland (anchor babies -- DEL), or 3. You were naturalized (Schwarzenegger). To be a \"natural born citizen\" you must be born in the US mainland of two US parents. Elg's Mother derived US citizenship when her father was naturalized. This was automatic -- it's called derivative citizenship. These are the forms of derivative citizenship that were effective due to federal statute at the time Elg was born: 1. An alien woman obtained automatic US citizenship when she married a US citizen male. 2. An alien woman obtained automatic us citizenship when her alien husband became naturalized. So, in 1907 when Elg was born on US soil, both of her parents were US citizens, therefore she was a \"natural born citizen.\" Funny thing is, when the US Supreme Court decided the case, the derivative citizen laws had changed, however, they retroactively applied them... because they had to. They had to use the law at the time of Elg's birth... because that's when she was born, hence she was a natural born citizen at the time of her birth and nothing could change that. All U. S. military personal and every other American under oath to protect and defend the U. S. Constitution will be duty bound to remove the fraudulent usurper. This situation is REGARDLESS of votes, electors, media blackouts, high profile embarrassments, state court decisions, supreme court actions or inaction, birth certificates real or forged, or any other documents -- Obama can NOT LEGALLY BE The US President. No documentation is required. Everyone should understand and KNOW the answer to the question of what country is the country of which Obama was a natural born citizen. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Barry Obama, Barry Soetoro, or Barack Hussein Obama II, to be a natural born United States citizen. Obama can NOT POSSIBLY be a \"natural born citizen\" of the U. S. because his father, Barack Hussein Obama Senior, was a subject of Great Britain and a citizen of Kenya. He was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed Obama's status until he was 21 years of age. Kenya\u2019s Constitution specifies that at age 21, Kenyan citizens who possesses citizenship in more than one country automatically lose their Kenyan citizenship unless they formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya. Whether Obama was born in Hawaii, Kenya, or the moon, is irrelevant. Birth documents, real or forged, are irrelevant. Yes, even VOTES ARE IRRELEVANT. Even Supreme Court action, or inaction, is irrelevant. It is simply FRAUD and illegal for Obama to be put in the office of U. S. President by any means or reason. Obama is at the epicenter of the greatest national disaster in the history of the United States. NOTHING that Obama would ever do in the office of U. S. President could ever be anything other than FRAUD and ILLEGAL. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that.",

Many actions against Obama are in court, and we still have not heard anything from Congress. Nor am I incorrect, in stating once again, that the duly elected federal government for the November 4, 2008 elections are the following: Presidency-next 4 years; and the Congress (House & Senate)-next 2 years. All of which were duly and properly -- legal elected representatives, under the framework of our Constitution. Nothing has been violated. We've had these discussions on Mr. Obama's citizenship long before you and your cronies came on these boards. And since those issues were long ago resolved here on milcom, you're simply beating a dead horse to death. I am under the impression, that you and your cronies don't really care what the courts establish concerning the President. It seems from all of your writings, that all of you are just playing for time. Either that, or you are spamming these discusion boards. I'm not quite sure where all of you are coming from, literally, but time will certainly tell, and tell quickly. Perhaps I was too quick to judge my initial impressions of 'wind and smoke?' Maybe you are really bent on sedition? This quote of yours is very interesting, if not somewhat disturbing: \"The time to March is not yet.\" So, any hint on what your next strategic move is gonna be? I'm all ears But then, whenever this revolution comes, I plan to be on the winning side!

Yes, Jefferson did indeed speak those words you cite. However, we, the USA are not in a sinking ship at sea. We are in several crisis situations at home and aborad, however only \"WE\" as the collective body of American citizens, represented by our duly elected government, can fix our ailments. If you and your lemmings are so distraught by the \"duly elected federal govt.,\" then by all means, have your march on Washington with your intent (the blood of patriots and tyrants) and get your civil insurrection going! If you're all that damn serious, then hurry up and fire your first shot! But I think you won't do that. I think you people are nothing more, than wind and smoke! And there is plenty enough hot air, to go around on these forums.... Actually I am not incorrect. Part of the reason the US Constitution exists is to prevent a majority trampling on violating parts they pick and choose, to a minority to demand those parts be enforced(Think Jim Crow laws, etc). The time to March is not yet. We still have an obligation to demand for those reprsenting government to correct itself before taking any action. Many actions against Obama are in court, and we still have not heard anything from Congress.",

        "content": "Internet reports mock 'Birthers' who want constitutional proof poll, AOL is asking readers: \u201cDo you have any doubt about Obama\u2019s eligibility to be president because of his birth status?\u201d AOL News brought \"Birthers\" to the mainstream when they published a small piece referencing Ben Smith's Politico.com report, \"Culture of conspiracy: the Birthers\" -- those who question Obama's eligibility to serve as commander-in-chief because of his birth and/or citizenship status. Smith describes these people as those who believe in \"obscure, discredited theories\" and \"operate and thrive on the fringe,\" and he liberally sprinkles his opinion-piece with pejoratives -- fringe; conspiracy theorists ; believers in UFOs and witches; wacko views; crazy, nutburger, demagogue, money-hungry, exploitative, irresponsible, filthy conservative imposters; the worst enemy of the conservative movement; crazy, demented, sick, troubled, and not suitable for civilized company. Smith's goal is to marginalize \"Birthers,\" and builds his case on three assumptions: 1. The challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence. 2. Courts across the country have summarily rejected the movement's theory -- that Obama can't be a citizen because his father wasn't -- as a misreading of U.S. la 3. Hawaii officials, along with contemporary birth announcements, affirm that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961. Lets' take a look at those statements: \"The challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence.\" False. That's a pretty broad brush -- by not qualifying \"challenges,\" Smith clearly implies that all of the challenges to Obama's eligibility have no grounding in evidence. The clearest evidence for a challenge comes from Obama himself, and it's the Hawaii Certification of Live Birth (COLB) released by the Obama campaign. Sandra Ramsey Lines began her training as a forensic document examiner in 1991. She is a Certified Diplomat of Forensic Sciences, a member of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, a member of the Southwestern Association of Forensic Document Examiners, and a member of the Questioned Document Subcommittee of the American Society of Testing and Materials. In a sworn affidavit, Ms. Lines wrote, \"After my review and based on my years of experience, I can state with certainty that the COLB presented on the internet by the various groups, which include the \"Daily Kos,\" the Obama Campaign, \"Factcheck.org\" and others cannot be relied upon as genuine.\" This is the document Obama's lawyers have pointed at as their evidence. Obama's own campaign website states: \"When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4,1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom\u2019s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.'s children. Since Sen. Obama has neither renounced his U.S. citizenship nor sworn an oath of allegiance to Kenya, his Kenyan citizenship automatically expired on Aug. 4,1982.\u201d Hello?? Obama admits he was a subject of Great Britain and a Citizen of Kenya for 21 years. Does the term, \"divided loyalties\" ring a bell? Judah Benjamin, an historian and former journalist, has written a two-part series challenging the Constitutionality of Barack Obama\u2019s eligibility to be President -- Part One -- Part Two. And, there's more EVIDENCE -- I don't know how much I'll put in here. \"Courts across the country have summarily rejected the movement's theory -- that Obama can't be a citizen because his father wasn't -- as a misreading of U.S. law.\" False. I guess Smith missed these two US Supreme Court cases -- U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, and Perkins v. Elg, -- both address \"natural born citizen\" -- and Obama fails both tests. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further, and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents [plural] within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the United States. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents [plural] AND born in the mainland of U.S. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents [plural] who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that. \"Hawaii officials, along with contemporary birth announcements, affirm that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" False. Hawaiian officials affirmed no such thing. Here is the statement of Linda Lingle, Hawaii's governor and Chiyome Leinaala ***ino, M.D., Director of the Hawaii Department of Health Director ***ino never affirmed \"that Obama was in fact born in Honolulu in 1961.\" What she affirmed was, \" I have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" ***ino only says she saw the document -- she never, ever said what was on it. This statement is false, Smith. Take it back. There are hundreds of links in these pages that support the notion Smith rambles on, writing, \"the suits share a vague, underlying notion that Obama must be some sort of foreigner, probably Kenyan, Indonesian or British, though none have any evidence or a coherent narrative to support the claim.\" True: Mr. Smith click this link -- there's your evidence. Don't know where he pulled this one from -- Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve as POTUS. True. Chester Arthur was ineligible to serve. Chester A. Arthur perpetrated a fraud as to his eligibility to be Vice President by spreading various lies about his parents\u2019 heritage. Arthur\u2019s father, William Arthur, became a United States citizen in August 1843, but Arthur was born in 1829 -- 14 years before. T herefore, Arthur was a British Citizen by descent, and a dual citizen at birth, if not his whole life. We\u2019ve also uncovered many lies told by Arthur to the press which kept this fact from public view when he ran for Vice President in 1880. Garfield won the election, became President in 1881, and was assassinated by a fanatical Chester Arthur supporter that same year. Historical facts here. What Smith is really saying in his piece is that a large segment of the American people don't have a right to know if Obama is constitutionally eligible for the job? In his article, he writes that the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions, having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. The press aide once tasked with quashing viral rumors, Ben LaBolt, no longer follows the fringe. But lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court. Does Smith forget \"stonewalling?\" \"the White House is, presently, ignoring the birth certificate questions,\" -- that's stonewalling -- right there! \"...having released an official copy of the Hawaii certificate during the presidential campaign. -- \"the official copy\" -- that's the one discredited by Ms. Lines and Dr. Polarik. \"...lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and for Obama have been steadily batting down a stream of lawsuits, winning motions to dismiss the suits in courts from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, from the state level to the United States Supreme Court -- 48 lawsuits -- maybe more -- and certainly more to come -- and they're being dismissed for standing -- not for lack of evidence -- it's a procedural thing -- none of the cases have been given a fair hearing. Smith manages to twist a legitimate, rational question into a pejorative, \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" -- but Smith, why IS \"[Obama] is spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to keep this information from getting out,\" when he could release his vault-copy birth certificate for $12. Obama's California lawyer, Fredric Woocher, who was named \"Southern California Super Lawyer of 2009\" and gets $600 per hour claims he is working pro bono to prevent the release the president's records from Occidental College -- he has used the bullying tactic of threatening sanctions against the plaintiff's lawyer for pursuing the case. Obama has teams of lawyers, in a dozen states -- and the Democratic National Committee has a bunch -- an Occidental College has theirs -- why is that -- why is Obama fighting the release of his bona fides? I guess I'm a \"Birther\" -- I don't care about Smith's smear -- it is Smith who is attempting to defend the indefensible, and he's doing it by by labeling reasonable people, who hold views different than his, irrelevant. He's not doing it by presenting a cogent argument. If there's no there there, then why won't Obama release his bona fides. His refusal diminishes his believability and reinforces mine. What are you hiding, Obama?\" -- It's a legitimate question -- it deserves a full and complete answer. \"\"www.worldnetdaily.com\"\" This message has been edited.

At one point, the delegates writing the Constitution in 1787 considered THREE \"presidents\" in the Executive for \"checks and balances.\" They considered a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators as well. Debating those issues, they felt that a \"natural born citizen\" clause for Senators would limit the pool of possible candidates and could cause bad feelings with immigrants needed to \"jump start\" the newly-formed republic. In the end, the Framers compromised that Senators be required to be US residents for 9 years, while striking the \"natural born citizen\" clause for the office. The Framers also compromised on ONE Executive vs. THREE.

John Bingham of Ohio, considered the father of the Fourteenth Amendment, confirms that understanding and the construction the framers used in regards to birthright and jurisdiction while speaking on civil rights of citizens in the House on March 9, 1866: \" ...

I ask you to consider that we stand this day pleading for the violated majesty of the law, by the graves of half a million of martyred hero-patriots who made death beautiful by the sacrifice of themselves for their country, the Constitution and the laws, and who, by their sublime example, have taught us all to obey the law; that none are above the law...\" 14th Amendment The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution is one of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments, first intended to secure the rights of former slaves. It was proposed on June 13, 1866, and ratified on July 9, 1868. The amendment provides a broad definition of citizenship, overruling Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) which had excluded slaves and their descendants from possessing Constitutional rights. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The 14th Amendment does not address the \"natural born citizen\" issue, only citizenship. U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark's importance is that it is the first case decided by the Supreme Court that attempts to explain the meaning of \"natural born citizen\" under Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. Natural born citizen is similar to the meaning of what a natural born subject is under Common Law in England. That is one of the reasons why the framers specifically included a grandfather clause (natural born Citizen OR a Citizen of the United States, at the time of adoption of this Constitution). The founding fathers knew that in order to be president, they had to grandfather themselves in because they were British subjects. If they didn't, they could not be President of the U.S. The holding in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark states that Wong Kim Ark is a native born citizen. If you look at the fact of Wong Kim Ark being born in San Francisco, CA, of Chinese parents, that holding is correct. In U. S. v Wong Kim Ark, the court thoroughly discussed \"natural born citizen,\" and in doing so, Justice Gray quoted directly from the holding in a prior Supreme Court case, Minor v. Happersett. The following passage is a quote from Minor as quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark: \"'At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country, of parents [plural] who were its citizens [plural], became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further, and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens.' Minor v. Happersett (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168.\" Perkins v. Elg Perkins v. Elg's importance is that it actually gives examples of what a \"natural born citizen\" of the U.S. is; what a \"citizen\" of the U.S. is; and what a \"native born citizen\" of the U. S. In this case, the U. S. Supreme Court found that a \"natural born citizen\" is a person who is born of two U.S. citizen parents AND born in the mainland of U.S. Citizen: On cross appeals, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 69 App.D.C. 175, 99 F.2d 408. Certiorari was granted, December 5, 1938, 305 U.S. 591, 59 S.Ct. 245, 83 L.Ed. --. First.-- On her birth in New York, the plaintiff became a citizen of the United States. Civil Rights Act of 1866: Ms. Elg was found to be a \"citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) Native Born citizen: This principle was clearly stated by Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont in his letter of advice to the Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, in Steinkauler's Case, 1875, 15 Op.Atty.Gen. 15. The facts were these: One Steinkauler, a Prussian subject by birth, emigrated to the United States in 1848, was naturalized in 1854, and in the following year had a son who was born in St. Louis. Four years later Steinkauler returned to Germany taking this child and became domiciled at Weisbaden where they continuously resided. When the son reached the age of twenty years the German Government called upon him to report for military duty and his father then invoked the intervention of the American Legation on the ground that his son was a native citizen of the United States. To an inquiry by our Minister, the father declined to give an assurance that the son would return to this country within a reasonable time. On reviewing the pertinent points in the case, including the Naturalization Treaty of 1868 with North Germany, 15 Stat. 615, the Attorney General reached the following conclusion: 'Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. Mr. Steinkauler was found to be a \"native born citizen\" because he was born in the mainland USA (St. Louis) Natural Born Citizen: U. S. Supreme Court's Relevant Facts: Miss Elg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1907. Her parents, who were natives of Sweden, emigrated to the United States sometime prior to 1906 and her father was naturalized here in that year. In 1911, her mother took her to Sweden where she continued to reside until September 7, 1929. Her father went to Sweden in 1922 and has not since returned to the United States. In November, 1934, he made a statement before an American consul in Sweden that he had voluntarily expatriated himself for the reason that he did not desire to retain the status of an American citizen and wished to preserve his allegiance to Sweden. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 327 (1939).] U. S. Supreme Court's Holding: The court below, properly recognizing the existence of an actual controversy with the defendants (Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617, 108 A.L.R. 1000) declared Miss Elg 'to be a natural born citizen of the United States' (99 F.2d 414) and we think that the decree should include the Secretary of State as well as the other defendants. [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 350 (1939).] Rationale of the logic is as follows: The U. S. Supreme Court in 1939 held that Elg was a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN because she was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 2, 1907, her father was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1906 under the Naturalization Act of 1906, and her mother derived her US citizenship in 1907 under the Expatriation Act of 1907. The Expatriation Act of 1907 extended the logic linking a woman's citizenship to her marital status and the status of her spouse. Ms. Elg was found to be a \"natural born citizen\" because she was born in the mainland USA (New York) of TWO US citizen parents. You can be a \"citizen\" under the following circumstances: 1. You were born of one citizen parent (Obama), or 2. You were born in the US mainland (anchor babies -- DEL), or 3. You were naturalized (Schwarzenegger). To be a \"natural born citizen\" you must be born in the US mainland of two US parents. Elg's Mother derived US citizenship when her father was naturalized. This was automatic -- it's called derivative citizenship. These are the forms of derivative citizenship that were effective due to federal statute at the time Elg was born: 1. An alien woman obtained automatic US citizenship when she married a US citizen male. 2. An alien woman obtained automatic us citizenship when her alien husband became naturalized. So, in 1907 when Elg was born on US soil, both of her parents were US citizens, therefore she was a \"natural born citizen.\" Funny thing is, when the US Supreme Court decided the case, the derivative citizen laws had changed, however, they retroactively applied them... because they had to. They had to use the law at the time of Elg's birth... because that's when she was born, hence she was a natural born citizen at the time of her birth and nothing could change that. All U. S. military personal and every other American under oath to protect and defend the U. S. Constitution will be duty bound to remove the fraudulent usurper. This situation is REGARDLESS of votes, electors, media blackouts, high profile embarrassments, state court decisions, supreme court actions or inaction, birth certificates real or forged, or any other documents -- Obama can NOT LEGALLY BE The US President. No documentation is required. Everyone should understand and KNOW the answer to the question of what country is the country of which Obama was a natural born citizen. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Barry Obama, Barry Soetoro, or Barack Hussein Obama II, to be a natural born United States citizen. Obama can NOT POSSIBLY be a \"natural born citizen\" of the U. S. because his father, Barack Hussein Obama Senior, was a subject of Great Britain and a citizen of Kenya. He was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed Obama's status until he was 21 years of age. Kenya\u2019s Constitution specifies that at age 21, Kenyan citizens who possesses citizenship in more than one country automatically lose their Kenyan citizenship unless they formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya. Whether Obama was born in Hawaii, Kenya, or the moon, is irrelevant. Birth documents, real or forged, are irrelevant. Yes, even VOTES ARE IRRELEVANT. Even Supreme Court action, or inaction, is irrelevant. It is simply FRAUD and illegal for Obama to be put in the office of U. S. President by any means or reason. Obama is at the epicenter of the greatest national disaster in the history of the United States. NOTHING that Obama would ever do in the office of U. S. President could ever be anything other than FRAUD and ILLEGAL. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that.",

So, in 1907 when Elg was born on US soil, both of her parents were US citizens, therefore she was a \"natural born citizen.\" Funny thing is, when the US Supreme Court decided the case, the derivative citizen laws had changed, however, they retroactively applied them... because they had to. They had to use the law at the time of Elg's birth... because that's when she was born, hence she was a natural born citizen at the time of her birth and nothing could change that. All U. S. military personal and every other American under oath to protect and defend the U. S. Constitution will be duty bound to remove the fraudulent usurper. This situation is REGARDLESS of votes, electors, media blackouts, high profile embarrassments, state court decisions, supreme court actions or inaction, birth certificates real or forged, or any other documents -- Obama can NOT LEGALLY BE The US President. No documentation is required. Everyone should understand and KNOW the answer to the question of what country is the country of which Obama was a natural born citizen. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Barry Obama, Barry Soetoro, or Barack Hussein Obama II, to be a natural born United States citizen. Obama can NOT POSSIBLY be a \"natural born citizen\" of the U. S. because his father, Barack Hussein Obama Senior, was a subject of Great Britain and a citizen of Kenya. He was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed Obama's status until he was 21 years of age. Kenya\u2019s Constitution specifies that at age 21, Kenyan citizens who possesses citizenship in more than one country automatically lose their Kenyan citizenship unless they formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya. Whether Obama was born in Hawaii, Kenya, or the moon, is irrelevant. Birth documents, real or forged, are irrelevant. Yes, even VOTES ARE IRRELEVANT. Even Supreme Court action, or inaction, is irrelevant. It is simply FRAUD and illegal for Obama to be put in the office of U. S. President by any means or reason. Obama is at the epicenter of the greatest national disaster in the history of the United States. NOTHING that Obama would ever do in the office of U. S. President could ever be anything other than FRAUD and ILLEGAL. Even Wikipedia gets it right: \"It is generally agreed that these constitutional provisions mean anyone born on American soil to parents who are U.S. citizens is a \"natural born citizen\" eligible to someday become president or vice-president...\" Two American parents and on American soil -- simple as that.",

Yes, Jefferson did indeed speak those words you cite. However, we, the USA are not in a sinking ship at sea. We are in several crisis situations at home and aborad, however only \"WE\" as the collective body of American citizens, represented by our duly elected government, can fix our ailments. If you and your lemmings are so distraught by the \"duly elected federal govt.,\" then by all means, have your march on Washington with your intent (the blood of patriots and tyrants) and get your civil insurrection going!
