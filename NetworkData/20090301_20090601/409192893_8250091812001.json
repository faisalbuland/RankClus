Petrucelli is one of the most cautious bankers in America. In fact, Petrucelli is so cautious that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. recently criticized his bank for not lending enough. The FDIC\u2019s negative review of East Bridgewater Savings Bank\u2019s loan volume is an anomaly in today\u2019s current banking scene as lenders reel from their role in offering too many cruddy mortgage products to borrowers with weak credit. Still, the FDIC slapped East Bridgewater Savings with a rare \u201cneeds to improve\u201d rating after evaluating the bank under the Community Reinvestment Act. From late 2003 through mid-2008, East Bridgewater Savings averaged 28 cents in loans for every dollar in deposit. The average loan-to-deposit ratio among similar size savings banks is more than 90 percent, FDIC data show. \u201cThere are no apparent financial or legal impediments that would limit the bank\u2019s ability to help meet the credit needs of its assessment area,\u201d the FDIC said in its CRA evaluation. FDIC examiners also faulted East Bridgewater for not advertising and marketing its loan products enough. The bank, which does not have a Web site, offers fixed-rate mortgages. But Petrucelli and his bank occupy the other end of the spectrum in an industry that lost $26.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Even the FDIC\u2019s own deposit insurance fund is in bad need of a boost after paying for an upswing in bank failures. And then there\u2019s East Bridgewater Savings. Bad or delinquent loans? Zero. Foreclosures? None. Money set aside in 2008 for anticipated loan losses? Nothing. \u201cWe\u2019re paranoid about credit quality,\u201d Petrucelli said. The 62-year-old chief executive has run the bank since 1992. The negative CRA rating, he said, caught him by surprise. The bank received \u201csatisfactory\u201d CRA ratings from the FDIC in 2003 and from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in early 2006. East Bridgewater Savings ended 2008 with $135 million in assets and deposits of $84 million. The bank even squeaked out a profit of $87,000. And its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 31.6 percent, or more than three times higher than many community banks in Massachusetts. But in the eyes of regulators, East Bridgewater Savings looks stingy. Its net loans and leases equaled 21 percent of assets. That compared with 72 percent among 385 savings banks across the country with assets between $100 million and $300 million.",

Petrucelli is one of the most cautious bankers in America. In fact, Petrucelli is so cautious that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. recently criticized his bank for not lending enough. The FDIC\u2019s negative review of East Bridgewater Savings Bank\u2019s loan volume is an anomaly in today\u2019s current banking scene as lenders reel from their role in offering too many cruddy mortgage products to borrowers with weak credit. Still, the FDIC slapped East Bridgewater Savings with a rare \u201cneeds to improve\u201d rating after evaluating the bank under the Community Reinvestment Act. From late 2003 through mid-2008, East Bridgewater Savings averaged 28 cents in loans for every dollar in deposit. The average loan-to-deposit ratio among similar size savings banks is more than 90 percent, FDIC data show. \u201cThere are no apparent financial or legal impediments that would limit the bank\u2019s ability to help meet the credit needs of its assessment area,\u201d the FDIC said in its CRA evaluation. FDIC examiners also faulted East Bridgewater for not advertising and marketing its loan products enough. The bank, which does not have a Web site, offers fixed-rate mortgages. But Petrucelli and his bank occupy the other end of the spectrum in an industry that lost $26.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Even the FDIC\u2019s own deposit insurance fund is in bad need of a boost after paying for an upswing in bank failures. And then there\u2019s East Bridgewater Savings. Bad or delinquent loans? Zero. Foreclosures? None. Money set aside in 2008 for anticipated loan losses? Nothing. \u201cWe\u2019re paranoid about credit quality,\u201d Petrucelli said. The 62-year-old chief executive has run the bank since 1992. The negative CRA rating, he said, caught him by surprise. The bank received \u201csatisfactory\u201d CRA ratings from the FDIC in 2003 and from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in early 2006. East Bridgewater Savings ended 2008 with $135 million in assets and deposits of $84 million. The bank even squeaked out a profit of $87,000. And its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 31.6 percent, or more than three times higher than many community banks in Massachusetts. But in the eyes of regulators, East Bridgewater Savings looks stingy. Its net loans and leases equaled 21 percent of assets. That compared with 72 percent among 385 savings banks across the country with assets between $100 million and $300 million. Hey spinmeister. Where's the part about the FDIC pushing loans to people that to people that can't afford them? I must have missed that sentence.......or you're talking out your azz. Honesty is not your strongest suit is it?",

Petrucelli is one of the most cautious bankers in America. In fact, Petrucelli is so cautious that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. recently criticized his bank for not lending enough. The FDIC\u2019s negative review of East Bridgewater Savings Bank\u2019s loan volume is an anomaly in today\u2019s current banking scene as lenders reel from their role in offering too many cruddy mortgage products to borrowers with weak credit. Still, the FDIC slapped East Bridgewater Savings with a rare \u201cneeds to improve\u201d rating after evaluating the bank under the Community Reinvestment Act. From late 2003 through mid-2008, East Bridgewater Savings averaged 28 cents in loans for every dollar in deposit. The average loan-to-deposit ratio among similar size savings banks is more than 90 percent, FDIC data show. \u201cThere are no apparent financial or legal impediments that would limit the bank\u2019s ability to help meet the credit needs of its assessment area,\u201d the FDIC said in its CRA evaluation. FDIC examiners also faulted East Bridgewater for not advertising and marketing its loan products enough. The bank, which does not have a Web site, offers fixed-rate mortgages. But Petrucelli and his bank occupy the other end of the spectrum in an industry that lost $26.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Even the FDIC\u2019s own deposit insurance fund is in bad need of a boost after paying for an upswing in bank failures. And then there\u2019s East Bridgewater Savings. Bad or delinquent loans? Zero. Foreclosures? None. Money set aside in 2008 for anticipated loan losses? Nothing. \u201cWe\u2019re paranoid about credit quality,\u201d Petrucelli said. The 62-year-old chief executive has run the bank since 1992. The negative CRA rating, he said, caught him by surprise. The bank received \u201csatisfactory\u201d CRA ratings from the FDIC in 2003 and from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in early 2006. East Bridgewater Savings ended 2008 with $135 million in assets and deposits of $84 million. The bank even squeaked out a profit of $87,000. And its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 31.6 percent, or more than three times higher than many community banks in Massachusetts. But in the eyes of regulators, East Bridgewater Savings looks stingy. Its net loans and leases equaled 21 percent of assets. That compared with 72 percent among 385 savings banks across the country with assets between $100 million and $300 million. Hey spinmeister. Where's the part about the FDIC pushing loans to people that to people that can't afford them? I must have missed that sentence.......or you're talking out your azz.

That determines how much they can borrow from a bank, mortgage company, etc. While interest rates are somewhat determined by a credit score (unless the person can 'buy down' the interest rate), the bank/lending place won't lend more than a person can repay (usually using a 45% debt to income ratio). I bought a house and acreage last year so this is pretty fresh in my mind. Being low income means you don't have much money to spend or repay a loan.",
