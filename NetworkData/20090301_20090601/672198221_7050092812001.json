Gates said the Pentagon will pay for the families of dead soldiers to travel to Dover, Del., to meet their remains. \u201cShould immediate family members wish to be present for the arrival of their fallen hero at Dover, and this can be done without unduly delaying the fallen\u2019s return to his or her own hometown, we will facilitate that travel, and we will fund it,\u201d Gates said. The decision is part of a policy to open the ceremonies to media coverage if the families consent. The policy reverses one adopted in 1991 that has barred coverage of returning war dead at Dover Air Force Base.",
