And, in fact, the budget adds $25 billion over five years for veterans and covers more than -- covers roughly a half a million more veterans under the VA system.\u201d Sen.

This summarises it pretty well: quote: Currently, the VA covers the full cost of medical ailments related to military service and bills third-party insurers for non-service related injuries.

The Administration cannot even be \"transparent\" with questions from their own party's senators ... for example ... quote: In another hearing on Mar. 10 about the president\u2019s budget proposal for 2010, Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag also was questioned by Sen. Murray about the third-party payer proposal. Part of the exchange reads as follows: Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.): \u201cCan you tell me if you are planning to include a third party billing proposal in the VA budget?\u201d Peter Orzsag: \u201cWell, there will be more details about the VA budget in April, but let me state very clearly that there won't be increases in out-of-pocket costs or premiums for veterans. And, in fact, the budget adds $25 billion over five years for veterans and covers more than -- covers roughly a half a million more veterans under the VA system.\u201d Sen. Murray: \u201cBut is this specific proposal one that you're looking at?\u201d Peter Orzsag: \u201cThere are lots of proposals that are being examined. I think it would be premature to be discussing specifics.\u201d Sen. Murray: \u201cOkay. Have you looked at the revenue impact of a proposal like that?\u201d Peter Orzsag: \u201cAgain, I'm going to just say it's premature to be discussing specifics. That will be part of the April budget.\u201d Orzsag waffled about as well as Alberto Gonzalez ... and with about the same lack of transparency. I'll give Senator Murray credit though ... she summed my feeling up pretty well. quote: Meanwhile, committee member Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), told Shinseki during the Senate hearing last week, \u201cOur vets already paid, and proposals that balance the VA budget on their backs are -- as far as I\u2019m concerned -- dead on arrival.\u201d",

For example, if an injured veteran is treated for the flu, the veteran\u2019s personal insurance is billed. If the injured veteran is treated for a service-related injury and requires hearing aids or prosthetics, for example, the VA covers the cost. <more> \"http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=45117\" The opposition to shifting the cost of service-connected treatment to private insurers is as follows\" quote: Veteran groups fear that shifting more of the cost to private insurance will do several things: 1) drive up premiums for veterans; 2) make it more difficult for injured veterans to find and retain health insurance; 3) discourage employers from hiring disabled veterans; and 4) possibly make a war injury a pre-existing condition. The Administration cannot even be \"transparent\" with questions from their own party's senators ... for example ... quote: In another hearing on Mar. 10 about the president\u2019s budget proposal for 2010, Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag also was questioned by Sen. Murray about the third-party payer proposal. Part of the exchange reads as follows: Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.): \u201cCan you tell me if you are planning to include a third party billing proposal in the VA budget?\u201d Peter Orzsag: \u201cWell, there will be more details about the VA budget in April, but let me state very clearly that there won't be increases in out-of-pocket costs or premiums for veterans. And, in fact, the budget adds $25 billion over five years for veterans and covers more than -- covers roughly a half a million more veterans under the VA system.\u201d Sen. Murray: \u201cBut is this specific proposal one that you're looking at?\u201d Peter Orzsag: \u201cThere are lots of proposals that are being examined. I think it would be premature to be discussing specifics.\u201d Sen. Murray: \u201cOkay. Have you looked at the revenue impact of a proposal like that?\u201d Peter Orzsag: \u201cAgain, I'm going to just say it's premature to be discussing specifics. That will be part of the April budget.\u201d Orzsag waffled about as well as Alberto Gonzalez ... and with about the same lack of transparency. I'll give Senator Murray credit though ... she summed my feeling up pretty well. quote: Meanwhile, committee member Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), told Shinseki during the Senate hearing last week, \u201cOur vets already paid, and proposals that balance the VA budget on their backs are -- as far as I\u2019m concerned -- dead on arrival.\u201d",

This summarises it pretty well: quote: Currently, the VA covers the full cost of medical ailments related to military service and bills third-party insurers for non-service related injuries.

And, in fact, the budget adds $25 billion over five years for veterans and covers more than -- covers roughly a half a million more veterans under the VA system.\u201d Sen. Murray: \u201cBut is this specific proposal one that you're looking at?\u201d Peter Orzsag: \u201cThere are lots of proposals that are being examined. I think it would be premature to be discussing specifics.\u201d Sen. Murray: \u201cOkay.
