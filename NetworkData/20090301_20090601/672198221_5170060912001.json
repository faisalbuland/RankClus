The body of Deputy Marshal Vincent Bustamante - who faced federal charges of stealing weapons and other government property - was found in Juarez on Wednesday, said Marshals Service spokesman Jeff Carter. Bustamante appeared to have been shot in the back of the head, a federal law enforcement source said. Chihuahua state police said the body had multiple wounds to the head - apparently consistent with an execution-style shooting, according to Edgar Roman, a reporter with XHIJ television in Juarez. Bustamante, 48, was charged with stealing U.S. government property including Glock and Ruger handguns, a shotgun and a pair of binoculars, according to court documents. According to the federal source, who was not authorized to speak about details of the case and asked not to be named, a pawnshop owner became suspicious when Bustamante attempted to pawn a shotgun and called the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The source said Bustamante would buy back items he had pawned on his pay days and return them. I wonder if he was killed by a Mexican drug dealer - or by another crooked Law Enforcement Officer. IMO, crooked Law Enforcement Officers are lower on the food chain than child rapists and pedophile Roman Catholic priests.",
