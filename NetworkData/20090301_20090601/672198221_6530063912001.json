In a wide-ranging interview, Obama sought to counter the notion that Afghanistan has become his war. He emphasized that it started on George W. Bush's watch. \"I think it's America's war. And it's the same war that we initiated after 9/11 as a consequence of those attacks,\" Obama said. \"The focus over the last seven years, I think, has been lost.\" More here: http://www.military.com/news/article/March-2009/obama-r...ml?col=1186032310810 \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
