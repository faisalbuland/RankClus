A while back I felt the need to start searching the net for forums where Army/USMC men and women gather after so many negative voices come out of Europe against US troops, and those are the only voices that are being heard all over the world so it seems. Let me assure you that there are a significant amount of people here that did not forget what you did for us in terms of kicking the Germans out of our backyards. It's just that , most European governments consist of liberal weed growing hippies that just find it cool to bash Americans especially US army and your foreign policies. It's mainly our magazines, our artists etc that play a leading role in the structural hatered (yes , that's the only word that fits here) against America('s troops) therefor making it look \"cool\" to bash the USA ... For me that is just unacceptable ... My heart hurts every time anyone makes a statement like that on tv.... just because it's considered \"cool\" in the artist-world. I'm 32 years old , so I didn't experience anything of the Great Wars (only my grandfather did) , so you would say that it hasn't affected me all that much directly. Looking at things like that tho would be completely ignoring our past and dishonouring the sacrifices that were made that established our freedom and democracy as we know it today. I want to sincerely thank you for those sacrifices, past and present. Of course I would love to see a world without war, but that just won't happen .... it has never been that way and probably never will be. I always imagine how it would be like if there wasn't a US army like there is today ... the world would look a lot different , let me tell you that. Whatever the dangerous situation I would ever find myself in wherever in the world ... I would be more than happy to be on the USA - side anytime...

In later years, I worked with Pilots from all the NATO Air Forces who were patrolling the airspace all along the Iron Curtain. I found the German people to be warm and caring, grateful that we were there to help keep the freedoms of all Western Europe secure. I found the personnel of all NATO forces to be caring, vigilant, hard-working people, dedicated to defending the freedoms of all Western Europeans with their lives. It is indeed sad that both World War I and World War II took place, especially considering how Belgium got caught in the middle both times, and was so terribly brutalized both times with the ravages of horrible war. May it NEVER happen again!! Your Thanks is greatly appreciated. Many Americans of the newer generation have lost the sense of mission felt by those that helped liberate your country in 1918 and 1945, but rest assured that there are those of us who would do it again if the call went up to stop some new tidal wave of oppression if it were sweeping away freedom in Europe again - - Have a great Spring and Summer - Wandering and Wondering",

Let me assure you that there are a significant amount of people here that did not forget what you did for us in terms of kicking the Germans out of our backyards. It's just that , most European governments consist of liberal weed growing hippies that just find it cool to bash Americans especially US army and your foreign policies. It's mainly our magazines, our artists etc that play a leading role in the structural hatered (yes , that's the only word that fits here) against America('s troops) therefor making it look \"cool\" to bash the USA ... For me that is just unacceptable ... My heart hurts every time anyone makes a statement like that on tv.... just because it's considered \"cool\" in the artist-world. I'm 32 years old , so I didn't experience anything of the Great Wars (only my grandfather did) , so you would say that it hasn't affected me all that much directly. Looking at things like that tho would be completely ignoring our past and dishonouring the sacrifices that were made that established our freedom and democracy as we know it today. I want to sincerely thank you for those sacrifices, past and present. Of course I would love to see a world without war, but that just won't happen .... it has never been that way and probably never will be. I always imagine how it would be like if there wasn't a US army like there is today ... the world would look a lot different , let me tell you that.

A while back I felt the need to start searching the net for forums where Army/USMC men and women gather after so many negative voices come out of Europe against US troops, and those are the only voices that are being heard all over the world so it seems. Let me assure you that there are a significant amount of people here that did not forget what you did for us in terms of kicking the Germans out of our backyards. It's just that , most European governments consist of liberal weed growing hippies that just find it cool to bash Americans especially US army and your foreign policies. It's mainly our magazines, our artists etc that play a leading role in the structural hatered (yes , that's the only word that fits here) against America('s troops) therefor making it look \"cool\" to bash the USA ... For me that is just unacceptable ... My heart hurts every time anyone makes a statement like that on tv.... just because it's considered \"cool\" in the artist-world. I'm 32 years old , so I didn't experience anything of the Great Wars (only my grandfather did) , so you would say that it hasn't affected me all that much directly. Looking at things like that tho would be completely ignoring our past and dishonouring the sacrifices that were made that established our freedom and democracy as we know it today. I want to sincerely thank you for those sacrifices, past and present. Of course I would love to see a world without war, but that just won't happen .... it has never been that way and probably never will be. I always imagine how it would be like if there wasn't a US army like there is today ... the world would look a lot different , let me tell you that. Whatever the dangerous situation I would ever find myself in wherever in the world ... I would be more than happy to be on the USA - side anytime...

Let me assure you that there are a significant amount of people here that did not forget what you did for us in terms of kicking the Germans out of our backyards. It's just that , most European governments consist of liberal weed growing hippies that just find it cool to bash Americans especially US army and your foreign policies. It's mainly our magazines, our artists etc that play a leading role in the structural hatered (yes , that's the only word that fits here) against America('s troops) therefor making it look \"cool\" to bash the USA ... For me that is just unacceptable ... My heart hurts every time anyone makes a statement like that on tv.... just because it's considered \"cool\" in the artist-world. I'm 32 years old , so I didn't experience anything of the Great Wars (only my grandfather did) , so you would say that it hasn't affected me all that much directly. Looking at things like that tho would be completely ignoring our past and dishonouring the sacrifices that were made that established our freedom and democracy as we know it today. I want to sincerely thank you for those sacrifices, past and present. Of course I would love to see a world without war, but that just won't happen .... it has never been that way and probably never will be. I always imagine how it would be like if there wasn't a US army like there is today ... the world would look a lot different , let me tell you that.

Both were proud to have served and help liberate Europe... I served in Germany for two years as a Tank Commander on the Iron Curtain along side of British, Canadian and (yes) German troops. In later years, I worked with Pilots from all the NATO Air Forces who were patrolling the airspace all along the Iron Curtain. I found the German people to be warm and caring, grateful that we were there to help keep the freedoms of all Western Europe secure. I found the personnel of all NATO forces to be caring, vigilant, hard-working people, dedicated to defending the freedoms of all Western Europeans with their lives. It is indeed sad that both World War I and World War II took place, especially considering how Belgium got caught in the middle both times, and was so terribly brutalized both times with the ravages of horrible war. May it NEVER happen again!! Your Thanks is greatly appreciated. Many Americans of the newer generation have lost the sense of mission felt by those that helped liberate your country in 1918 and 1945, but rest assured that there are those of us who would do it again if the call went up to stop some new tidal wave of oppression if it were sweeping away freedom in Europe again - - Have a great Spring and Summer - Wandering and Wondering",
