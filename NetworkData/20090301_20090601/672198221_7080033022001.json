The MiG35 version of the MiG29 series is even more of a threat that no one has acknowledged because no one has purchased it yet. It can be built to have a lower RCS than the F-35 and has far better performance than the Su30 and the only thing that prevents this low cost fighter(28 million) from being bought aggressively is that Mikoyan has become the red headed step child of Russia's aviation industry in which Sukhoi gets the lion's share of military money through the newly formed consortium.

The F-22 is supposed to be the F-15 replacement, not the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none F-35. WHile I think the F-35 might be a little better than Flanker acknowledges, it still is not an air superiority fighter. The ONLY aiframe that outclasses other current new production fighters is the F-22. And we are not buy enough of them. SO do the math; retire 500 or so F-15s and buy 187 replacements. Do you honestly believe that is enough? About 40% of congress doesn't believe so. The CSAF doesn't think so. Long-range planners do not think so. SO go ahead. rant about no real threats out there. But since crystal balls really do not work, knowing the exact threat 10 or 15 years down the road is best left to those who do the analysis. And how can you make that \"doing right for the machinists' union and CT jobs\" statement when we are giving free money to practically any entity that wants it under the guise of economic stimulus?",

        "quote": "Originally posted by I_M_Qwerty: Senator Dodd appears to be caught again in the crossfire. With a tough race to retain his senate seat in 2010 and already damaged by his lie concerning his responsibility for the bonus exception in the Stimulus Bill, he now has to choose between doing right for the nation's defense ... or doing right for the machinists' union and CT jobs. quote: Facing a potentially tough election in 2010, Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd rallied Thursday to the side of union members in his state whose jobs are at risk under an Obama administration budget proposal. \"I'm here today to tell you that I'll do everything I can ... to make our case to our colleagues. That is where the final defense will be for this program,\" Dodd told members of the Hartford chapter of the International Association of Machinists. The group would take a big hit under Defense Secretary Robert Gates' budget proposal, which calls for halting production of the F-22 jet -- the jet's engines are made in Connecticut. But Dodd, along with Connecticut Rep. John Larson, met with union members Thursday to assure them they'd battle Gates over the issue. Dodd has fought before to save the F-22 program, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and he said Thursday that party distinction doesn't matter to him at a time when his constituents are worried about keeping food on the table. <more> \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/09/dodd-caught-crossfire-calls-halt-f-production/\"", 
        "reply": " Why do you think cancelling the F-22 is \"the right thing for national defense\"? The F-22 is supposed to be the F-15 replacement, not the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none F-35. WHile I think the F-35 might be a little better than Flanker acknowledges, it still is not an air superiority fighter. The ONLY aiframe that outclasses other current new production fighters is the F-22. And we are not buy enough of them. SO do the math; retire 500 or so F-15s and buy 187 replacements. Do you honestly believe that is enough? About 40% of congress doesn't believe so. The CSAF doesn't think so. Long-range planners do not think so. SO go ahead. rant about no real threats out there. But since crystal balls really do not work, knowing the exact threat 10 or 15 years down the road is best left to those who do the analysis. And how can you make that \"doing right for the machinists' union and CT jobs\" statement when we are giving free money to practically any entity that wants it under the guise of economic stimulus?",

You fail to mention that we outspend China and every other country by a massive proportion. Also the fact that our strong economic ties make war less and less likely. Again, looking at the years since WWII, when was the last time the US went to war with a country they had very strong economic and financial ties with? All that being said, no where in my original post did I say that we shouldn't buy new aircraft. My point is that we are stuck on buying aircraft to fight WWIII while we are heavily engaged in two smaller wars. We should place the PRIORITY on fighter the war today, not the war ten years from now. \"Russian leadership has been on cloud 9 since Gates made his announcement of canceling the F-22 and they know the next 4 years will result in drastic reductions of US military power. Once Russia realizes that Obama is a paper tiger and the military cuts are made, then they will do what they please, when they please and will tell the US to shut the FuQ up.\" That is total BS. In the first place, Gates isn't canceling the F-22. Not to mention the fact that you constantly overstate the strength of China and Russia. sw614: If you actually read what I wrote, you'd see I mentioned tanker aircraft. Also, the C-5 is on it's way out and I did cap the number at 3 to avoid naming every aircraft in our inventory. The reason the F-16 has performed so many CAS missions is because we don't have enough true attack aircraft and there is no other role for the fighter.",

        "reply": " You fail to mention that we outspend China and every other country by a massive proportion. Also the fact that our strong economic ties make war less and less likely. Again, looking at the years since WWII, when was the last time the US went to war with a country they had very strong economic and financial ties with? All that being said, no where in my original post did I say that we shouldn't buy new aircraft. My point is that we are stuck on buying aircraft to fight WWIII while we are heavily engaged in two smaller wars. We should place the PRIORITY on fighter the war today, not the war ten years from now. \"Russian leadership has been on cloud 9 since Gates made his announcement of canceling the F-22 and they know the next 4 years will result in drastic reductions of US military power. Once Russia realizes that Obama is a paper tiger and the military cuts are made, then they will do what they please, when they please and will tell the US to shut the FuQ up.\" That is total BS. In the first place, Gates isn't canceling the F-22. Not to mention the fact that you constantly overstate the strength of China and Russia. sw614: If you actually read what I wrote, you'd see I mentioned tanker aircraft. Also, the C-5 is on it's way out and I did cap the number at 3 to avoid naming every aircraft in our inventory. The reason the F-16 has performed so many CAS missions is because we don't have enough true attack aircraft and there is no other role for the fighter.",
