The first was the NY stock market crash of '29 followed by a series of smaller crashes and the general slide in the market until 1932. 2. The period of unusually wet summers in the great plains ended in 1930, beginning four straight years of drought that resulted in the loss of over 100,000,000 acres of farmland (an area twice the size of the entire state of Nebraska). Known as 'the dustbowl', the area had already been financially hit by falling prices for agricultural goods in the decade after WWI. 2% of the entire US population suddenly became homeless migrants and the value of US farmland plummeted to the lowest level in half a century. 3. The Smoot-Hawley Tarriff Act of 1930 and the subsequent response of all our trading partners caused a 66% drop in exports and a 61% drop in imports, basically halting foreign trade at the precise moment it was needed to lessen the impact of the Stock Market Crash. The original intent was to protect US production by increasing the price of foreign goods. The real impact was an almost universal rejection of US goods and a deepening of the depression.

What are you talking about? What part of 'failed industries' are you missing? Losing 60% of your external market for goods and services is not a \"spot shortage\", it kills your business. Failed businesses add to unemployment, lost external orders, failed shipyards (who needs ships when fewer goods are being transported?), losses in rail contracts, and the domestic market during a recession/depression isn't going to make up any part of your profits.
