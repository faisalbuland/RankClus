Our mission was not to democratize Afghanistan nor to free it from Taliban control. By having diverted to Iraq (unnecessarily) we lost our opportunity in Afghanistan and would not \"get\" AlQaeda and bin Ladin. I have also felt that since the Taliban operate across the Afghan/Pakistan border and since we fear that the Taliban might get control of the Atom Bomb from Pakistan, the US would then \"own\" the Pakistan problem.

Kilcullen is an anthropologist as much as a military strategist. His critique of most popular attitudes towards the opposition is based on the simple observation that we have a tendency towards lazy thinking -- of lumping all real or potential anti-American populations together and calling them by the same name. Something like the way we used to lump the USSR, China, Albania, and Yugoslavia together as nothing more than \"communist\" who sleep in the same bed. Kilcullen has argued that we need to understand the differences between our opponents on the global stage -- and exploit those differences. They may all be \"Muslim funamentalist terrorist camel jockeys\" to some of us, but they don't see it that way at all. The devout Muslims of Indonesia have their own local problems that they are organized against, as do Muslim populations of other nations. The morons who flew the planes on 9/11 didn't hate us for our freedoms, although it's comforting to think they did. They hated us mostly because we put Playboys in their book stores, beer in their stores, McDonald's on their malls, and ladies with naked legs on their streets.

He's unlikely to appear on Tyra Banks. Yet I'm sure he'd have something valuable to tell us about how to tap into the modest but simmering pro-Western sentiments of the younger people in Iran, for whom the events of 1979 are ancient history, just as Vietnam is for our students. They're pretty tired of the reign of the Mullahs too. The division between the older theocrats and the younger dissidents is an opportunity ripe for exploitation.
