Charles, thank you for waiting and for calling. Great to have you here. Hello. CALLER: Thanks, Rush. Rush, listen, I voted Republican, and I didn't -- really didn't want to see Obama get in office. But, you know, Rush, you're one reason to blame for this election, for the Republicans losing. First of all, you kept harping about voting for Hillary. The second big issue is the -- was the torture issue. I'm a veteran. We're not supposed to be torturing these people. This is not Nazi Germany, Red China, or North Korea. There's other ways of interrogating people, and you kept harping about it -- \"It's OK,\" or \"It's not really torture.\" And it was just more than waterboarding. Some of these prisoners were killed under torture. And it just -- it was crazy for you to keep going on and on like Levin and Hannity and Hewitt. It's like you're all brainwashed. And my last comment is, no matter what Obama does, you will still criticize him because I believe you're brainwashed. You're just -- and I hate to say it -- but I think you're a brainwashed Nazi. Anyone who could believe in torture just has got to be - there's got to be something wrong with them. LIMBAUGH: You know -- CALLER: And I know Bush wanted to keep us safe and all of that, but we're not supposed to be torturing these people. LIMBAUGH: Charles, if anybody is admitting that they're brainwashed it would be you. CALLER: No, no, no, Rush. I don't think so. LIMBAUGH: Charles. Charles, Charles -- CALLER: You, Hannity, Hewitt, and Levin are all brainwashed and you know it. LIMBAUGH: -- you said -- you said at the beginning of your phone call -- CALLER: Yeah. LIMBAUGH: -- that you didn't want Obama in there -- CALLER: That's right. LIMBAUGH: -- but you voted for him because of me. CALLER: I didn't vote for him. I voted for McCain. I voted Republican.

You call me somebody who supports torture and you want credibility on this program? You know, you're just plain embarrassing and ludicrous. But it doesn't surprise me that you're the kind of Republican that our last candidate attracted. Because you're no Republican at all based on what the hell you've said here.

Charles, thank you for waiting and for calling. Great to have you here. Hello. CALLER: Thanks, Rush. Rush, listen, I voted Republican, and I didn't -- really didn't want to see Obama get in office. But, you know, Rush, you're one reason to blame for this election, for the Republicans losing. First of all, you kept harping about voting for Hillary. The second big issue is the -- was the torture issue. I'm a veteran. We're not supposed to be torturing these people. This is not Nazi Germany, Red China, or North Korea. There's other ways of interrogating people, and you kept harping about it -- \"It's OK,\" or \"It's not really torture.\" And it was just more than waterboarding. Some of these prisoners were killed under torture. And it just -- it was crazy for you to keep going on and on like Levin and Hannity and Hewitt. It's like you're all brainwashed. And my last comment is, no matter what Obama does, you will still criticize him because I believe you're brainwashed. You're just -- and I hate to say it -- but I think you're a brainwashed Nazi. Anyone who could believe in torture just has got to be - there's got to be something wrong with them. LIMBAUGH: You know -- CALLER: And I know Bush wanted to keep us safe and all of that, but we're not supposed to be torturing these people. LIMBAUGH: Charles, if anybody is admitting that they're brainwashed it would be you. CALLER: No, no, no, Rush. I don't think so. LIMBAUGH: Charles. Charles, Charles -- CALLER: You, Hannity, Hewitt, and Levin are all brainwashed and you know it. LIMBAUGH: -- you said -- you said at the beginning of your phone call -- CALLER: Yeah. LIMBAUGH: -- that you didn't want Obama in there -- CALLER: That's right. LIMBAUGH: -- but you voted for him because of me. CALLER: I didn't vote for him. I voted for McCain. I voted Republican. LIMBAUGH: Oh, so -- CALLER: I voted Republican. LIMBAUGH: -- you're saying I turned people off to -- CALLER: You turned people off with all your -- all this \"vote for Hillary\" and all this BS, because you must think people are really stupid. LIMBAUGH: That was Operation Chaos. That was to keep the -- CALLER: You -- no. It didn't work. LIMBAUGH: -- chaos in the [unintelligible] of the Democrat primaries. CALLER: It didn't work. And now what we have with you Hannity, Levin, and Hewitt: sour grapes. That's all we have. And believe me, I'm not -- I'm more to the right than I am to the left. LIMBAUGH: Oh, of course, you are. CALLER: I am, and that's -- LIMBAUGH: Of course, you are. You wouldn't be calling here with all these sour grapes if you weren't. CALLER: Well, I'm so tired of listening to you -- LIMBAUGH: Oh, of course, you are. CALLER: -- go on and on with this -- you've been brainwashed.

LIMBAUGH: Barack Obama -- CALLER: What's the matter with you? LIMBAUGH: Barack -- CALLER: You never even served in a military. LIMBAUGH: Barack Obama is -- CALLER: I served in the Marine Corps and the Army. LIMBAUGH: Charles, Barack Obama is president of the United States today because of stupid, ignorant people who think like you do. You pose -- you and your ignorance are the most expensive commodity this country has. You think you know everything. You don't know diddly-squat. You call me a Nazi? You call me somebody who supports torture and you want credibility on this program? You know, you're just plain embarrassing and ludicrous. But it doesn't surprise me that you're the kind of Republican that our last candidate attracted. Because you're no Republican at all based on what the hell you've said here.
