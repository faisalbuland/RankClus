I pose this question in light of the recent \"surge\" of posters who have joined in the past few days, primarily to post in the \"Obama isn't a Natural Born Citizen\" type threads as well as thread regarding the Marine who was arrested for threatening President Obama. Most of these posters joined within a couple days, if not hours of each other, and if one pays attention, they all use remarkably similar grammar and syntax. More indicative is the fact that some of these posters have deleted thier profiles as soon as they post one or two posts so they can disappear. I am well aware that a lot of times when something similar happens it's because a featured Mil.com story/article has popped up at the top of a Google search or the like - however most of the threads that I am speaking of were initiated or opened by one of this group themselves , as an attempt to sucker us into it. We've all seen spam attacks before, but this one bears a more worrisome side - it has all the hallmarks of a well organized and dedicated PsyWar/Propaganda operation. When one disappears, another appears, and regardless of which one it is, they can be traced back to the same origin. Some of them even debate amongst themselves - creating false personas with opposing points of view to try and mask what is happening. Even more worrisome is what they are attempting to incite - a large number of them are trying to make it seem as if assassinating a President is ok, and that it would be patriotic to try and overthrow our elected government by force - and coming to our site to try and elicit our own military personnel to do it. We all have differing points of view on a wide range of matters - except one - our loyalty to our country. That's what sets us regular posters apart - that despite our differences, we want to see our nation prosper peacefully. The surge of posters I am referring to on the other hand appear bent on the opposite - inciting civil strive amonst us to aid in their effort to destabilize our government and to use this site to recruit military/former military personnel to aid in that goal.",

I pose this question in light of the recent \"surge\" of posters who have joined in the past few days, primarily to post in the \"Obama isn't a Natural Born Citizen\" type threads as well as thread regarding the Marine who was arrested for threatening President Obama. Most of these posters joined within a couple days, if not hours of each other, and if one pays attention, they all use remarkably similar grammar and syntax. More indicative is the fact that some of these posters have deleted thier profiles as soon as they post one or two posts so they can disappear. I am well aware that a lot of times when something similar happens it's because a featured Mil.com story/article has popped up at the top of a Google search or the like - however most of the threads that I am speaking of were initiated or opened by one of this group themselves , as an attempt to sucker us into it. We've all seen spam attacks before, but this one bears a more worrisome side - it has all the hallmarks of a well organized and dedicated PsyWar/Propaganda operation. When one disappears, another appears, and regardless of which one it is, they can be traced back to the same origin. Some of them even debate amongst themselves - creating false personas with opposing points of view to try and mask what is happening. Even more worrisome is what they are attempting to incite - a large number of them are trying to make it seem as if assassinating a President is ok, and that it would be patriotic to try and overthrow our elected government by force - and coming to our site to try and elicit our own military personnel to do it. We all have differing points of view on a wide range of matters - except one - our loyalty to our country. That's what sets us regular posters apart - that despite our differences, we want to see our nation prosper peacefully. The surge of posters I am referring to on the other hand appear bent on the opposite - inciting civil strive amonst us to aid in their effort to destabilize our government and to use this site to recruit military/former military personnel to aid in that goal.

The word Veteran applies to someone who has long experience in the subject at hand. In this case, a \"Veteran member\" of Mil.com is someone who has posted here a lot...for a long time. Perhaps, but considering that the site is devoted to things military to allow the term \"veteran\" to be applied in any context to someone who never served seems more than a little bit inappropriate. I meant nothing disrespectful. I am just saying that IMO, Mil.com defines it that way, not I. Sorry if I offended anyone. Didn't mean to. I was speaking in general terms and did not intend to focus on any particular individual. Please accept my apology if I caused any offense. Personally I find the use of any such system, regardless of titles used, a little silly.",

I pose this question in light of the recent \"surge\" of posters who have joined in the past few days, primarily to post in the \"Obama isn't a Natural Born Citizen\" type threads as well as thread regarding the Marine who was arrested for threatening President Obama. Most of these posters joined within a couple days, if not hours of each other, and if one pays attention, they all use remarkably similar grammar and syntax. More indicative is the fact that some of these posters have deleted thier profiles as soon as they post one or two posts so they can disappear. I am well aware that a lot of times when something similar happens it's because a featured Mil.com story/article has popped up at the top of a Google search or the like - however most of the threads that I am speaking of were initiated or opened by one of this group themselves , as an attempt to sucker us into it. We've all seen spam attacks before, but this one bears a more worrisome side - it has all the hallmarks of a well organized and dedicated PsyWar/Propaganda operation. When one disappears, another appears, and regardless of which one it is, they can be traced back to the same origin. Some of them even debate amongst themselves - creating false personas with opposing points of view to try and mask what is happening. Even more worrisome is what they are attempting to incite - a large number of them are trying to make it seem as if assassinating a President is ok, and that it would be patriotic to try and overthrow our elected government by force - and coming to our site to try and elicit our own military personnel to do it. We all have differing points of view on a wide range of matters - except one - our loyalty to our country. That's what sets us regular posters apart - that despite our differences, we want to see our nation prosper peacefully. The surge of posters I am referring to on the other hand appear bent on the opposite - inciting civil strive amonst us to aid in their effort to destabilize our government and to use this site to recruit military/former military personnel to aid in that goal.",

Most of these posters joined within a couple days, if not hours of each other, and if one pays attention, they all use remarkably similar grammar and syntax. More indicative is the fact that some of these posters have deleted thier profiles as soon as they post one or two posts so they can disappear. I am well aware that a lot of times when something similar happens it's because a featured Mil.com story/article has popped up at the top of a Google search or the like - however most of the threads that I am speaking of were initiated or opened by one of this group themselves , as an attempt to sucker us into it. We've all seen spam attacks before, but this one bears a more worrisome side - it has all the hallmarks of a well organized and dedicated PsyWar/Propaganda operation. When one disappears, another appears, and regardless of which one it is, they can be traced back to the same origin. Some of them even debate amongst themselves - creating false personas with opposing points of view to try and mask what is happening. Even more worrisome is what they are attempting to incite - a large number of them are trying to make it seem as if assassinating a President is ok, and that it would be patriotic to try and overthrow our elected government by force - and coming to our site to try and elicit our own military personnel to do it. We all have differing points of view on a wide range of matters - except one - our loyalty to our country. That's what sets us regular posters apart - that despite our differences, we want to see our nation prosper peacefully.

If that is the case, \"Veteran Member\" needs to be replaced too. Whole lotta people running around with the \"Veteran\" label that never served a day. The word Veteran applies to someone who has long experience in the subject at hand. In this case, a \"Veteran member\" of Mil.com is someone who has posted here a lot...for a long time. Perhaps, but considering that the site is devoted to things military to allow the term \"veteran\" to be applied in any context to someone who never served seems more than a little bit inappropriate. I meant nothing disrespectful. I am just saying that IMO, Mil.com defines it that way, not I. Sorry if I offended anyone. Didn't mean to. I was speaking in general terms and did not intend to focus on any particular individual. Please accept my apology if I caused any offense. Personally I find the use of any such system, regardless of titles used, a little silly. Agreed. It is silly. No apology necessary.",
