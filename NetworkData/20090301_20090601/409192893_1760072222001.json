So, what have we learned thus far\u2026 We are no longer at war \u2013 but have some concerned disenfranchised non-citizens who inconveniently created a manmade catastrophe killing 3000 people. Thankfully, most of those people were the upper class Wall-Street greedy ponzi-type so, hey \u2013 chances are they were ripping off someone somewhere\u2026 Our military personnel are at risk of becoming terrorists and should be put under tight surveillance for the unforeseen future\u2026 All radical extremists such as Pat Robertson, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, should be prohibited from using the media so to assure the truth seekers such as Keith Olbermann, Chris Matthews, and all from the courageous CNN, MSNBC, ABC, etc, are able to help the government maintain stability throughout this transition to pure solidarity. Ethnic cleansing is outlawed but all Christians practicing religious and/or conservative principles are prohibited from such anti-Socialist American Solidarity gatherings unless a state official is present to correct and teach true government ordained practices. The owners of corporations are hereby declared unpatriotic \u2013 anti-Americans unless they submit to the POTUS\u2019s rule of solidarity and unify with the European socialists. Those evil Chrysler people should be jailed for their unpatriotic duty to give up their money for the nationalist cause. All workers will be unionized \u2013 except those working for the government in senate positions. The office of POTUS now controls all housing, banking, manufacturing, retirement, wages, census, health care, including medications, - - he shall be praised by the people and teleprompters shall be installed wherever the emperor POTUS ventures. All citizens designated as self-employed shall be taxed until they submit to becoming initiated into solidarity. All citizens earning more than deemed necessary shall gladly disgorge those evidences of illicit greed to the proper authorities thus rightfully designated by the emperor POTUS to those coming up for re-election he deems worthy. Oh, and all this unemployment, don\u2019t worry, the taxes being extorted from the remaining non-solidarity capitalist corporations will cover most unemployment checks for the next few years. After that, well, let\u2019s get there first, by then we\u2019ll think of something\u2026 Kind-a funny isn\u2019t it \u2013 Pork Barrel Spending = Swine Flu \u2013 who would-a thought\u2026 and what about that manufacturer building parts for Chrysler \u2013 took their 1000 jobs and went to Mexico\u2026 Damn if that swine flu stopped them from making a buck\u2026 I wonder if the Emperor will stop their parts from entering the US\u2026? But then the SEC has at least 100 lawsuits against the emperor\u2019s administration because the money allocated for SMALL BUSINESSES WAS SENT TO COMPANIES EUROPE \u2013 gee who would-a thought that \u2013 other than Joe the Plumber\u2026? Yep \u2013 unemployment is what 8.6% - well, unless you live in California and a few other states where it\u2019s now pushing up past 12% - but hey, at least in California we all know the illegal immigrants are well taken care-of\u2026 I guess they are technically legally illegal, hmm, or would it be illegally legal\u2026? Well, hopefully, the emperor will fix that problem our senators told us about regarding the military personnel \u2013 ya know \u2013 shhhh \u2013 not too loud \u2013 all those uneducated, undisciplined, thugs, who were terrorizing all those descent nice insurgent folks\u2026 I mean, who could blame those folks for being mad at us \u2013 blowing up their building \u2013 shooting at regular-joe citizens just because they had AK47\u2019s and grenade launchers shooting at our soldiers \u2013 it obviously was NOT their fault. Most were not even from those countries they actually volunteered to fight against us\u2026 that\u2019s more than our allies did for us\u2026 Yep, those disenfranchised folks were really being abused and praise be to solidarity we will prove to the world how peaceful we are and invite those poor terrorized folks held in those dilapidated ruins for so long \u2013 yep \u2013 now the world will see \u2013 we\u2019ll give them unemployment and welfare checks \u2013 green cards and citizenship \u2013 we\u2019ll give them social security and heck, why not give them one of those re-possessed houses from the dead-beats who weren\u2019t paying their mortgage because they lost their jobs to the overseas and European companies who are grateful to receive the BAILOUT and STIMULUS money from the emperor \u2013 surely we afford to give those poor terrorized folks a new house and chance to start over to see what wonderful world this can be\u2026 Just a thought\u2026 now that's change we can believe in...! \u2026tick, tick, tick, tick,\u2026",
