        "content": "New Hampshire Senate Passes Marriage Equality The New Hampshire Senate approved a bill on Wednesday that would legalize same-sex marriage. The 13-11 vote mirrors the House's similarly close vote of 186-179 in March. Because the senate voted on a bill that has been amended since the house voted on it, HB 436 will return back to the house for a third reading. The senate version removed gender-specific language. Gov. John Lynch has expressed his preference for the same-sex civil unions already legal in New Hampshire. A poll released earlier this week shows that 55% of New Hampshire voters support marriage for same-sex couples, while 39% are opposed.

Compromises on Marriage Bill May 29, 2009 New Hampshire house and senate negotiators agreed on new language in the state's same-sex marriage bill late Friday, reports The Boston Globe . The bill will be voted on Wednesday, the next time the legislature convenes. The new version specifies that all religious organizations have exclusive control over their religious doctrines, policies, and beliefs on marriage. Last week, the house turned down a revised same-sex marriage bill that included religious exemptions mandated by Gov. John Lynch.
