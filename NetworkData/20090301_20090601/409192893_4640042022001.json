Capitalism gives the money multiplication , money as medium of exchange, effect that can return the exponential growth to the economy. We MUST STOP throwing away money at increasing government as it will DELAY and DELAY economic recovery. Personally, I have no problem with government action. None of our infrastructure would have been built without government action, and this goes back to the Eire Canal, or the building of our first railroad system over 150 years ago. Private Capital is unable to to this and was NEVER able to do this. My problems with this stimulous bill is that the majority of it is not \"aimed\" and \"focused.\" Some of it is specifically aimed at creating a new modern rail system - Which is something we must have to remain a modern nation. But far to much of it is simply being tossed at items which are hit and miss, good and bad - Not an organised approach. And quite a bit of it is aimed at bailing out Capitalists whose greed brought about their own downfall. These banks should not be bailed out, rather they should be nationalised - bought at their true value, capitalised, and and give loans to honest productive companies, and individuals.

We MUST STOP throwing away money at increasing government as it will DELAY and DELAY economic recovery.", 
        "reply": " Personally, I have no problem with government action. None of our infrastructure would have been built without government action, and this goes back to the Eire Canal, or the building of our first railroad system over 150 years ago. Private Capital is unable to to this and was NEVER able to do this. My problems with this stimulous bill is that the majority of it is not \"aimed\" and \"focused.\" Some of it is specifically aimed at creating a new modern rail system - Which is something we must have to remain a modern nation. But far to much of it is simply being tossed at items which are hit and miss, good and bad - Not an organised approach.

If they move out of New York the State will lose millions and more folks will lose jobs. All I can say to the Governor and Mayor of New York is this. \"Your idiots\". Doesn't Rush live in Palm Beach? And Trump isn't leaving New York because that's where they film that awful reality show that he does. You're correct about Rush, but he records a number of his shows in New York, and pays taxes on a proportional basis. He also maintains a residence here. Now he tells us, he's leaving... Trump has alwasy maintained that the wealthy SHOULD pay a larger share of taxes. And he's always included himself when he says that... I remember being surprised about those remarks, but he's repeated them a number of times. At least he realises that you can't squeeze blood from a stone... Dave",
