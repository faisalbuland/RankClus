Saw the eagle fly, Through a clear, blue sky 1965, the 8th of November. Now he's fifty-eight And his ponytail's grey But the battle still plays in his head. He limps when he walks, But he's strong when he talks About the shrapnel they left in his leg. He puts on a grey suit Over his Airborne tattoo And He ties it on one time a year And remembers the fallen, As he orders a tall one And swallows it down with his tears.

He puts on a grey suit Over his Airborne tattoo And He ties it on one time a year And remembers the fallen, As he orders a tall one And swallows it down with his tears.
