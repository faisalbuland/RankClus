Guys ask about problems like yours and there's aways someone who knows who provides the answers. With your bike, I'm wondering if every fitting is tight, maybe the brake reservour cap is loose causing a lack of pressure. The guys on that site have mentioned that sometimes they have to bleed their system several times just to get all the air bubble out. Good luck. Wish I could be of more help. Don",

Did you use C clamps to push the pads in before you put the new pads on? That way it pushes all the fluid back to well so you can adjust all of it.",
