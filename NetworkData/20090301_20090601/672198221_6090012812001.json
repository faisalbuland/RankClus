There is a scarcity of proof that Saddam Hussein was 'bad' for America. It certainly was bad for him, and Iraqis. Even after the Gulf War, there is little more evidence that he was 'bad' for America than there is that Dopey was 'bad' for Seven Dwarves. He was light years away from being comparable to Hitler, other than in lip hair. Hitler may have 'sensitized' America considering it took almost 3 years of 'his' war and a declaration on his part, to aid the realization. Of late that sensitivity to 'bad guys' may have developed into an allergic hyperreaction to even hallucinated despots. This message has been edited.
