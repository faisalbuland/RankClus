OH, the main target for the Imperial Japanese at Pearl Harbor wasn't the battleships, it was the carriers, only they were out at sea during the attack... They were glamorous, they were impressive and were the \"big stick\" of their day... Nation's fortunes were placed in them and there was a \"battleship race\" and treaties were negotiated around them, as to size, weaponry, number and tonnage... Even by today's standards, their \"rifles\" are impressive... Too bad their day has come and gone, they were graceful and their crews took great pride in being \"battleship sailors\"...
