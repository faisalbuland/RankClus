Savings of $1,000 to $2,000 per year. Buy 2 lbs of Maxwell House coffee for $6 at Wal-Mart and make a pot of coffee per day for a month rather than buying a $4 cup at Starbucks and save $1,000 per year. Stop buying things. Keep your appliances until they stop working. Realize that it isn\u2019t a competition with your neighbor to die with the most stuff. Mow your own lawn. Better yet, if you have kids, make them do it. Learn to embrace dandelions and crabgrass. Who cares? Wash your car in the driveway. Better yet, if you have kids, make them do it. Buy your next car and drive it for 10 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first. Buy a car that gets at least 30 mpg, as $200 a barrel oil is a certainty in the next decade. Tell your kids they are lucky to have whatever you give them. When you walk into a room and CNBC is on TV, switch immediately to When Animals Attack. Don\u2019t answer the phone \u2013 it\u2019s someone asking for something. Don\u2019t throw out your old sneakers \u2013 you can use them to cut the lawn. Turn the heat down to 60 degrees at night. Go to the poor man\u2019s Disney World, Wildwood, N.J. and save $4,000 for a weeks vacation. Eat out once per month rather than three times a week and you\u2019ll magically save $3,000 to $4,000 per year. Contribute into your 401k until it hurts. Picture yourself handing out yellow smiley stickers at the age of 80 in a Wal-Mart as motivation. Buy some gold, just in case. Plant a vegetable garden, just in case. Instead of spending $40 at the movies, go for a hike in a National Park like Valley Forge. Have a catch with your son. Understand the motivation of anyone who is telling you anything. Most people have an angle. When the guy in the Mercedes or BMW in front of you is wearing their hat sideways, your taxes are probably making their car loan payment. When you see that same guy pushing a cart with a 52 inch HDTV out of Best Buy, your taxes are probably making the payment to Capital One.",

Here's some suggestions to ponder from his article \"Escalator of Life - Going Down\" *http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/quinn/2009/0319.html quote: Bring your lunch to work. Savings of $1,000 to $2,000 per year. Buy 2 lbs of Maxwell House coffee for $6 at Wal-Mart and make a pot of coffee per day for a month rather than buying a $4 cup at Starbucks and save $1,000 per year. Stop buying things. Keep your appliances until they stop working. Realize that it isn\u2019t a competition with your neighbor to die with the most stuff. Mow your own lawn. Better yet, if you have kids, make them do it. Learn to embrace dandelions and crabgrass. Who cares? Wash your car in the driveway. Better yet, if you have kids, make them do it. Buy your next car and drive it for 10 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first. Buy a car that gets at least 30 mpg, as $200 a barrel oil is a certainty in the next decade. Tell your kids they are lucky to have whatever you give them. When you walk into a room and CNBC is on TV, switch immediately to When Animals Attack. Don\u2019t answer the phone \u2013 it\u2019s someone asking for something. Don\u2019t throw out your old sneakers \u2013 you can use them to cut the lawn. Turn the heat down to 60 degrees at night. Go to the poor man\u2019s Disney World, Wildwood, N.J. and save $4,000 for a weeks vacation. Eat out once per month rather than three times a week and you\u2019ll magically save $3,000 to $4,000 per year. Contribute into your 401k until it hurts. Picture yourself handing out yellow smiley stickers at the age of 80 in a Wal-Mart as motivation. Buy some gold, just in case. Plant a vegetable garden, just in case. Instead of spending $40 at the movies, go for a hike in a National Park like Valley Forge. Have a catch with your son. Understand the motivation of anyone who is telling you anything. Most people have an angle. When the guy in the Mercedes or BMW in front of you is wearing their hat sideways, your taxes are probably making their car loan payment. When you see that same guy pushing a cart with a 52 inch HDTV out of Best Buy, your taxes are probably making the payment to Capital One.",
