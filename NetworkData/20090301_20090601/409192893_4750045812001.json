But, it seems to me that Congress is going well out of its way to tax anything above $250k. In regard to the TARP bill and bonuses, HR 1586 sets the rate of tax at 90% of the lesser of: (1) the bonus amounts paid; or (2) the amount of such taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeding $250,000 ($125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return). And, of course, there is going to be much higher taxes on ANYBODY making over $250k, but what that rate is going to be is beyond me. Basically, not only have they set a minimum wage, now they are essentially enforcing a maximum wage. WTF???",
