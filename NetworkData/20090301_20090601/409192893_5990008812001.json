Journal Article Excerpt Securities Litigation Reform Bill Is Now Law Journal article; Journal of Accountancy, Vol. 181, 1996 The House voted 319-100 and the Senate voted 68-30 to override President Bill Clinton's veto of a bill that will reduce the number of frivolous class action securities lawsuits. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was drafted to reshape securities laws that professional investors and some class-action lawyers have used against corporations, accountants and securities underwriters to win billions of dollars in damages. The president unexpectedly vetoed the bill after signaling earlier that he might sign it. Only days before the veto the president was seeking reassurance that the Securities and Exchange Commission would take administrative measures to protect the interests of small investors, according to White House aides. SEC chairman Arthur Levitt endorsed a safe harbor provision to shield companies from the legal liability for incorrect predictions. American Institute of CPAs key persons, state CPA societies and national CPA firms urged members of Congress to support the reforms in the bill. \"The passage of the securities legislation is a tremendous victory for both business and the CPA profession,\" said Barry C. Melancon, AICPA president. \"The AICPA key persons program and the Accountants Coalition, a coalition of national CPA firms, deserve tremendous credit for the effort and support given to achieve this goal.\" Perhaps the bill's strongest supporter in Congress, Senator Christopher J.

Journal Article Excerpt Securities Litigation Reform Bill Is Now Law Journal article; Journal of Accountancy, Vol. 181, 1996 The House voted 319-100 and the Senate voted 68-30 to override President Bill Clinton's veto of a bill that will reduce the number of frivolous class action securities lawsuits. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was drafted to reshape securities laws that professional investors and some class-action lawyers have used against corporations, accountants and securities underwriters to win billions of dollars in damages. The president unexpectedly vetoed the bill after signaling earlier that he might sign it. Only days before the veto the president was seeking reassurance that the Securities and Exchange Commission would take administrative measures to protect the interests of small investors, according to White House aides. SEC chairman Arthur Levitt endorsed a safe harbor provision to shield companies from the legal liability for incorrect predictions. American Institute of CPAs key persons, state CPA societies and national CPA firms urged members of Congress to support the reforms in the bill. \"The passage of the securities legislation is a tremendous victory for both business and the CPA profession,\" said Barry C. Melancon, AICPA president. \"The AICPA key persons program and the Accountants Coalition, a coalition of national CPA firms, deserve tremendous credit for the effort and support given to achieve this goal.\" Perhaps the bill's strongest supporter in Congress, Senator Christopher J.

Ronald Reagan screwed this economy up - and every Republican Administration since him has made it worse. The Republican Administration that just left almost ran this country into the ground. Now, the Democrats have to clean up the mess. But nothing you've said negates the Republican Party's ineptitude - or it's inability to relate to the common citizen. Reasonable people see this fact. Reasonable people have been firing the Republican Party all over the country and the World - for that matter. I've stated what I posted twice now - I'd do it a third time; but since a lot of you all are Republicans, you wouldn't understand no matter how many times I posted about recent economic history.

Only days before the veto the president was seeking reassurance that the Securities and Exchange Commission would take administrative measures to protect the interests of small investors, according to White House aides. SEC chairman Arthur Levitt endorsed a safe harbor provision to shield companies from the legal liability for incorrect predictions. American Institute of CPAs key persons, state CPA societies and national CPA firms urged members of Congress to support the reforms in the bill. \"The passage of the securities legislation is a tremendous victory for both business and the CPA profession,\" said Barry C. Melancon, AICPA president. \"The AICPA key persons program and the Accountants Coalition, a coalition of national CPA firms, deserve tremendous credit for the effort and support given to achieve this goal.\" Perhaps the bill's strongest supporter in Congress, Senator Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), urged both House and Senate Democrats to override Clinton's veto, even if it amounted to a defeat of the intent of his own party's president. In his veto message, Clinton said his main concern was that the bill's pleading requirements, which require the plai... ---end snip----- Here\u2019s your friends CHRIS DODD and clan \u2013 DEMOCRATS \u2013 even overriding their own president to fill their disgusting pockets\u2026 Chris Dodd \u2013 the pay-to-play senator \u2013 had help though\u2026 Barney Frank\u2019s lover boy-friend was also Chairman of Freddie/Fannie \u2013 who help write the new underwriting regulations to a NEW LOWER STANDARD\u2026 hey, but Barney wasn\u2019t complaining \u2013 his boyfriend jumped shipped after a year or two (I think it was) and when he left \u2013 HE TOOK 30-MILLION DOLLARS with him\u2026 gee \u2013 I bet he and Barney had swell weekend after that little bon\u2026.bone\u2026 bonus\u2026 YEP \u2013 that\u2019s your democrats\u2026 sort-a like William Jefferson \u2013 90-thousand dollars he mistakenly left in the freezer\u2026 Two men already been in jail for what \u2013 5-yrs \u2013 where\u2019s Jefferson\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s right he\u2019s petitioning the FBI to get his BRIBERY MONEY BACK\u2026 \u2026blame the economy on Reagan\u2026 someone needs change their bongwater more often\u2026",
