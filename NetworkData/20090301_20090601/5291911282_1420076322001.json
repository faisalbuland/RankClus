He is also a Nam Vet. They have a friend, Doug James he is a Road Captain for the ride every year. Dana and her hub usually ride to the Wall, but they couldn't this year. Here is a pix of Dana, cute as she can be and both were very nice. We live about 3 miles apart, we will be keeping intouch. I like making new friends and I have met a lot on here.",
