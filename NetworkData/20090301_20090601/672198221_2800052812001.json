U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Dean Boyd said the restrictions on Lindh, 28, will expire Friday. He said the current limits Lindh faces are not public and he cannot discuss them. Although former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft first imposed restrictions on Lindh in March 2002, Boyd said they have been modified several times as \"the perceived threat of Lindh's communications diminished.\" Lindh is serving a 20-year sentence for aiding Afghanistan's now-defunct Taliban government. He was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 by U.S. forces sent to topple the Taliban after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He was charged with conspiring to kill Americans and supporting terrorists but pleaded guilty in 2002 to lesser offenses. Lindh is incarcerated at a medium-security federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., about 80 miles west of Indianapolis, with a scheduled release date of May 23, 2019. Jim Brosnahan, a San Francisco attorney who represents Lindh, said Wednesday that he is pleased the restrictions are being lifted. Among other things, he said the changes will allow Lindh to contact and meet with people other than his attorneys and relatives. Brosnahan said the current restrictions have prevented Lindh from telling his side of the story of how he ended up aiding Islamic fundamentalists who ran an oppressive Afghan regime. \"I think that as time has gone by people have begun to realize, inside the government and to some extent outside the government, that John was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" Brosnahan said. Lindh, a convert to Islam, went to Afghanistan to fight for the Taliban against the Northern Alliance, which received U.S. backing. Lindh's father has said his son has been wrongly maligned as a traitor and murderer. Brosnahan said the prison restrictions Lindh has faced were imposed \"for reasons that have nothing to do with the purpose... (...) Before President George W. Bush left office in January, Lindh's parents and attorneys tried unsuccessfully to persuade Bush to commute Lindh's sentence and set him free.",

He was charged accordingly. Was Spann the guy who was taped telling him, \"We can only get the Red Cross to help so many guys and unless you start cooperating you're not going to be one of them.\" You should watch the whole tape - it's around. Spann was killed shortly after in that Afghan prison riot, was he not? Lindh was in the prison before the 'riot'. He must have been very fortunate as I believe only a handful of inmates survived in a cellar to surrender two days later. That 'armed uprising' started when one, of the more than 600 prisoners, grabbed a guard's gun. It quickly turned into a 'mass suicide' as the unarmed, and many trussed inmates let themelves get shot. Lindh was doing an academy award performance then. Because later on he had his pictures taken and 'fessed up'. I don't think he expected the sentence, though, but after you've confessed in open court what can you say, 'they tortured me'?",

Spann was killed, Lindh was wounded, and then he and others hid for several days after in a bunker until forced out. By the time of his arrest by American forces, (not just detention by the Northern Alliance)Lindh, as an American citizen, had withheld information as to his true identity, and his knowledge of plans for an enemy operation against US Forces that resulted in the death of CIA agent and UNITED STATES CITIZEN Mike Spann. He was charged accordingly.", 
        "reply": " Was Spann the guy who was taped telling him, \"We can only get the Red Cross to help so many guys and unless you start cooperating you're not going to be one of them.\" You should watch the whole tape - it's around. Spann was killed shortly after in that Afghan prison riot, was he not? Lindh was in the prison before the 'riot'. He must have been very fortunate as I believe only a handful of inmates survived in a cellar to surrender two days later. That 'armed uprising' started when one, of the more than 600 prisoners, grabbed a guard's gun. It quickly turned into a 'mass suicide' as the unarmed, and many trussed inmates let themelves get shot. Lindh was doing an academy award performance then. Because later on he had his pictures taken and 'fessed up'. I don't think he expected the sentence, though, but after you've confessed in open court what can you say, 'they tortured me'?",

        "content": "\"Let themselves get shot\"? Where do you get your information? The Battle Of Qala-i-Jangi The Taliban surrender With their military situation in Northern Afghanistan becoming critical, many Taliban agreed to surrender to Northern Alliance General Abdul Rashid Dostum. Approximately 300[2] foreign fighters (mostly Arabs, Chechens and Pakistanis), under the impression that they would later be set free, drove to Mazar-i-Sharif and laid down their weapons. However, they were not freed, as the Americans wanted to question them about possible links with the Al Qaeda network. Instead they were transferred to Qala-i-Jangi (the house of war in Persian), a 19th century fortress that Dostum used as his headquarters and ammunition depot. Dostum claimed the surrender was a \"great victory\" for the Alliance,[3] a bloodless success that would allow the future reconciliation of Afghanistan. But these claims were short-lived. The battle Inside the fortress, the prisoners had not been searched, and it soon became evident that they had concealed weapons in their clothes. On November 24 in two separate incidents, two of Dostum's commanders were killed by prisoners with grenades. Despite this, security at the prison was not reinforced. On the 25th, two CIA officers, Johnny \"Mike\" Spann, a retired Marine, and Dave Tyson, an Uzbek speaker and area expert[4], arrived at Qala-i-Jangi to carry out the interrogations[5]. Instead of speaking to the prisoners separately, they confronted them in a group. Whatever the reason, the rebellion began at 11.15 am, when the prisoners overpowered their 20-odd guards and killed Mike Spann with two gunshots to the head. Spann became the first American killed in action in the Afghanistan war.[3] The Taliban quickly overran a large part of Qala-i-Jangi, including an armory, from which they helped themselves to a large store of AK-47s, RPG rocket launchers and mortars. Tyson managed to escape to a secure part of the fortress where he found himself trapped with a television crew from the German ARD network. He borrowed their satellite phone, and called the US embassy in Uzbekistan, requesting reinforcements[6]. Tyson specifically requested no air support, due to the proximity of allied Afghani forces. The Afghans also brought reinforcements: a T-55 tank entered the compound and started firing into the Taliban area. Despite Tyson's requests, several 500-pound guided bombs were dropped in an attempt to destroy the armory, which was now serving as a Taliban firebase. Several other television crews arrived on the scene of the battle, ensuring it got one of the widest media coverages of the whole war. The successive stages of the fighting were filmed extensively, providing rare footage of special forces units in combat. At 2:00 pm a mixed Special forces team, formed with nine U.S. Special Forces and six British Special Boat Service operatives, arrived and joined the Afghans firing at the Taliban from the northern part of the fort. Starting at 4:00 pm until nightfall, they directed nine airstrikes against the entrenched Taliban, who continued to put up a fierce resistance. The next day, the Alliance soldiers set up a command post near the Northern gate, to direct their tank and mortar fire. They were joined by four more Special Forces soldiers, and by eight men of the 10th Mountain Division. Two Northern Alliance soldiers taking cover behind the body of a dead Taliban.At 11:00 pm, a GBU-32 guided bomb, weighing 2,000 pounds (957 kg), mistakenly hit the command post, killing four (some sources say 30[3]) Northern Alliance soldiers, destroying a tank and injuring five U.S. and two British Marines.[6] That night an AC-130 Spectre gunship circled over the fortress, firing thousands of rounds at the Taliban. The main ammunition depot was hit, creating a huge explosion which continued to burn throughout the night. By the morning of the 27th the Taliban resistance had slackened, and the Alliance soldiers were able to mount an attack, with tanks, and by the end of the day, they had recaptured most of the fort. The Americans recovered Spann's body, which the Taliban had booby trapped with a grenade.[6] On the 28th General Dostum arrived on the scene of the battle, and tried to persuade the last Taliban still holding out in the basement to surrender. His entreaties had no effect, however, and the last prisoners only gave themselves up two days later, after the Alliance troops had forced them out of the basement by pumping it full of water.",

U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Dean Boyd said the restrictions on Lindh, 28, will expire Friday. He said the current limits Lindh faces are not public and he cannot discuss them. Although former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft first imposed restrictions on Lindh in March 2002, Boyd said they have been modified several times as \"the perceived threat of Lindh's communications diminished.\" Lindh is serving a 20-year sentence for aiding Afghanistan's now-defunct Taliban government. He was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 by U.S. forces sent to topple the Taliban after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He was charged with conspiring to kill Americans and supporting terrorists but pleaded guilty in 2002 to lesser offenses. Lindh is incarcerated at a medium-security federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., about 80 miles west of Indianapolis, with a scheduled release date of May 23, 2019. Jim Brosnahan, a San Francisco attorney who represents Lindh, said Wednesday that he is pleased the restrictions are being lifted. Among other things, he said the changes will allow Lindh to contact and meet with people other than his attorneys and relatives. Brosnahan said the current restrictions have prevented Lindh from telling his side of the story of how he ended up aiding Islamic fundamentalists who ran an oppressive Afghan regime. \"I think that as time has gone by people have begun to realize, inside the government and to some extent outside the government, that John was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" Brosnahan said. Lindh, a convert to Islam, went to Afghanistan to fight for the Taliban against the Northern Alliance, which received U.S. backing. Lindh's father has said his son has been wrongly maligned as a traitor and murderer. Brosnahan said the prison restrictions Lindh has faced were imposed \"for reasons that have nothing to do with the purpose... (...) Before President George W. Bush left office in January, Lindh's parents and attorneys tried unsuccessfully to persuade Bush to commute Lindh's sentence and set him free.",

        "content": "\"Let themselves get shot\"? Where do you get your information? The Battle Of Qala-i-Jangi The Taliban surrender With their military situation in Northern Afghanistan becoming critical, many Taliban agreed to surrender to Northern Alliance General Abdul Rashid Dostum. Approximately 300[2] foreign fighters (mostly Arabs, Chechens and Pakistanis), under the impression that they would later be set free, drove to Mazar-i-Sharif and laid down their weapons. However, they were not freed, as the Americans wanted to question them about possible links with the Al Qaeda network. Instead they were transferred to Qala-i-Jangi (the house of war in Persian), a 19th century fortress that Dostum used as his headquarters and ammunition depot. Dostum claimed the surrender was a \"great victory\" for the Alliance,[3] a bloodless success that would allow the future reconciliation of Afghanistan. But these claims were short-lived. The battle Inside the fortress, the prisoners had not been searched, and it soon became evident that they had concealed weapons in their clothes. On November 24 in two separate incidents, two of Dostum's commanders were killed by prisoners with grenades. Despite this, security at the prison was not reinforced. On the 25th, two CIA officers, Johnny \"Mike\" Spann, a retired Marine, and Dave Tyson, an Uzbek speaker and area expert[4], arrived at Qala-i-Jangi to carry out the interrogations[5]. Instead of speaking to the prisoners separately, they confronted them in a group. Whatever the reason, the rebellion began at 11.15 am, when the prisoners overpowered their 20-odd guards and killed Mike Spann with two gunshots to the head. Spann became the first American killed in action in the Afghanistan war.[3] The Taliban quickly overran a large part of Qala-i-Jangi, including an armory, from which they helped themselves to a large store of AK-47s, RPG rocket launchers and mortars. Tyson managed to escape to a secure part of the fortress where he found himself trapped with a television crew from the German ARD network. He borrowed their satellite phone, and called the US embassy in Uzbekistan, requesting reinforcements[6]. Tyson specifically requested no air support, due to the proximity of allied Afghani forces. The Afghans also brought reinforcements: a T-55 tank entered the compound and started firing into the Taliban area. Despite Tyson's requests, several 500-pound guided bombs were dropped in an attempt to destroy the armory, which was now serving as a Taliban firebase. Several other television crews arrived on the scene of the battle, ensuring it got one of the widest media coverages of the whole war. The successive stages of the fighting were filmed extensively, providing rare footage of special forces units in combat. At 2:00 pm a mixed Special forces team, formed with nine U.S. Special Forces and six British Special Boat Service operatives, arrived and joined the Afghans firing at the Taliban from the northern part of the fort. Starting at 4:00 pm until nightfall, they directed nine airstrikes against the entrenched Taliban, who continued to put up a fierce resistance. The next day, the Alliance soldiers set up a command post near the Northern gate, to direct their tank and mortar fire. They were joined by four more Special Forces soldiers, and by eight men of the 10th Mountain Division. Two Northern Alliance soldiers taking cover behind the body of a dead Taliban.At 11:00 pm, a GBU-32 guided bomb, weighing 2,000 pounds (957 kg), mistakenly hit the command post, killing four (some sources say 30[3]) Northern Alliance soldiers, destroying a tank and injuring five U.S. and two British Marines.[6] That night an AC-130 Spectre gunship circled over the fortress, firing thousands of rounds at the Taliban. The main ammunition depot was hit, creating a huge explosion which continued to burn throughout the night. By the morning of the 27th the Taliban resistance had slackened, and the Alliance soldiers were able to mount an attack, with tanks, and by the end of the day, they had recaptured most of the fort. The Americans recovered Spann's body, which the Taliban had booby trapped with a grenade.[6] On the 28th General Dostum arrived on the scene of the battle, and tried to persuade the last Taliban still holding out in the basement to surrender. His entreaties had no effect, however, and the last prisoners only gave themselves up two days later, after the Alliance troops had forced them out of the basement by pumping it full of water.",
