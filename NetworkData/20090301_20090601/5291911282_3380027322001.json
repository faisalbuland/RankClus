Well, now the people at Hohenfels are telling him that I needed at CMD Sponsorship. The people at Ft. Stewart(where I am) are telling me that they don't know what he is talking about, that his S1 should have just ammended the orders. Well the paperwork for the CMD Sponsorship has already been put in...but he's been there for 3 months already-And the paperwork itself is going on week 3. Does anyone know how long this usually takes? Is it possible that I will be there before he gets leave in July? It would break my heart if I'm not.... If anyone knows anything about this I would appreciate any kind of information on this you can give me! Thanks!",

So when they say yes it will happen. They took him as a non command sponsored soldier so it could take longer. they only allow so many to have housing there.",
