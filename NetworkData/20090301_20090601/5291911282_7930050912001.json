When filling out the form, you have three choices: (1) Sign-up (2) Will decide when I'm 60 (3) Not interested. When you list your spouse and then decide on #2, you have done your spouse a disservice. If you should die before age 60, then they will not get any of your retirement pay. So, take a little cut in your monthly pay check, so you can take care of your family later. Had a friend whose husband died at 55--retired pay of a CW5 would have been helpful, but instead she got NOTHING!",
