We were led to believe that the show would be no more than a Q and A about the local area and what it had to offer. This could not have been farther from the truth. He soon started talking about Jane Fonda and his personal feelings about how we should not have invaded Iraq. He asked us the following questions: -Would you go on vacation in Iraq with your family? -Why do we have 70,000 troops in Germany when we have illegal aliens invading our country along the border? Same thing in S. Korea. -Why don't we (US) split Iraq up into three seperate countries? -Why should we keep fighting in Afghanistan? Needless to say the interview was a challenge, but all in all we handled it well. The question is, how does a person in uniform answer such questions about US foreign policy when addressing the media? This message has been edited.

The original author is a LtCdr in the US Navy who is here with me attending the Command and General Staff College at Ft Leavenworth, KS. This appearance on the radio talk show was a school approved media apearance where eight O-4s (not all Army but all O-4s) appeared on a radio talk show. The idea is for us CGSC students to get out into the community and through interaction with local print, radio, and TV media get our points of view to the American people. We are future battlaion commanders so the Army does not want us gun shy of the media or tough interviews. We wanted to get some feed back from others in the military and that is why we are blogging about it on military.com. A couple points about this radio appearance First, I could not disagree more with some of the posts saying that we should have ended the interview and walked out when the questions got hard. The intent was to get our perspectives out to the American people. We would have looked foolish and failed in the intent if we had done that. Some questions could not be answered directly but this was an opportunity to redirect to similar subjects we could address from our persepectives. Second none of these questions were above our paygrade. We all have deployed numerous times and can address these questions from the perspecitives we have seen. Again redirecting if necessary. We also as mid level Army officers should know what is going on in the world enough to comment, from our perspective, on these topics. Third, we should have gone into the interview a bit more prepared. This is definitely a learning point for all of us. We were given the impression most of the questions would not be policy or polical in nature. But when we got there the questions turned much more difficult. I don't think any one of us will make that mistake again and are better officers for it. I am very intested in constructive feedback from the broader military audiance on this so please keep the comments coming.

        "content": "I am another one of the eight interviewed on the radio show on 10 April. Although my colleague \u201cWarrior123\u201d has some good points, in some ways, I disagree with the comment regarding interview preparation. Certainly, being completely prepared for an interview is ideal, but that will not always be the case. Thinking on your feet during this low-threat type show was a good experience and perhaps served as practice for the countless more ad-lib interview opportunities that we will certainly face as more senior officers. The host was not hostile in any way towards the military. The questions he asked, although some were more difficult than others, were basic questions that he and other Americans have regarding the military. I thought that all eight spoke of their various experiences without crossing any political opinion lines. Since so little of the American population has or ever will serve in the military, most will never truly understand what it is like to serve in combat overseas. The countless questions of the details of Iraq, Afghanistan and the like is nothing more that a quest for knowledge, both from the host and perhaps his listeners. Of course, there were many \u201cwhat do you think about\u2026\u201d questions that the host asked, that lured us into stating some personal opinions about U.S. policies. The great thing about radio though, is that the viewers don\u2019t see the facial expressions made while formulating an answer to a tough question. The few seconds spent thinking about the best answer can prevent a regretful response. Bottom line on this radio interview is that the host is interested in learning more about our service as well as giving his listeners the opportunity to learn more about the small percentage of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines serving in the local area. We saw this as a chance to portray the military in a positive light and I think that we did just that. MAJ Scott Lenzmeier US Army, Command and General Staff College, Staff Group 3B Leavenworth KS",
