No concerns or fears, no money worries, no stressing over work. Just enjoy the weekend. I don't plan on getting dressed past my Gi, screwing around with bids or email, or cooking a damn thing. No laundry, cleaning, organizing, or tasks. I'm going to lay there next to her and sleep (heh, riiiiiiight) the entire weekend away with nothing but a little music to break the monotony of silent background noise. Just talking and snuggling. Yes, I said snuggling. Bite me. But, in case I haven't been obvious enough yet, I am ecstatic more than anything else. I just cannot WAIT to see her, and these three weeks are going to creep by with an agonizing pace that makes prison look like a Caribbean vacation. 38 years old and smitten by the charms of a lady.

No concerns or fears, no money worries, no stressing over work. Just enjoy the weekend. I don't plan on getting dressed past my Gi, screwing around with bids or email, or cooking a damn thing. No laundry, cleaning, organizing, or tasks. I'm going to lay there next to her and sleep (heh, riiiiiiight) the entire weekend away with nothing but a little music to break the monotony of silent background noise. Just talking and snuggling. Yes, I said snuggling. Bite me. But, in case I haven't been obvious enough yet, I am ecstatic more than anything else. I just cannot WAIT to see her, and these three weeks are going to creep by with an agonizing pace that makes prison look like a Caribbean vacation. 38 years old and smitten by the charms of a lady. Ain't life grand? It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
