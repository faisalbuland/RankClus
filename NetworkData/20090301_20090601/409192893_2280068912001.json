It isn't terribly in depth, but I do agree with most of what is written, because it does point to the things that did happen. I don't agree with Pat on many things, but on this I would say he is dead on. Here are a few snippets: \"The \"forgotten depression\" of 1920\u201321 was caused by a huge increase in the money supply for President Wilson's war. When the Fed started to tighten at war's end, production fell 20 percent from mid-1920 to mid-1921, far more than today. Why did we not read about that depression? Because the much-maligned Warren Harding refused to intervene. He let businesses and banks fail and prices fall. Hence, the fever quickly broke, and we were off into \"the Roaring Twenties.\" But, the Fed reverted, expanding the money supply by 55 percent, an average of 7.3 percent a year, not through an expansion of the currency, but through loans to businesses. Thus, when the Fed tightened in the overheated economy, the Crash came, as the stock market bubble the Fed had created burst. Herbert Hoover, contrary to the myth that he was a small-government conservative, renounced laissez-faire, raised taxes, launched public works projects, extended emergency loans to failing businesses and lent money to the states for relief programs. Hoover did what Obama is doing.\" \"Indeed, in 1932, FDR lacerated Hoover for having presided over the \"greatest spending administration in peacetime in all of history.\" His running mate, John Nance Garner, accused Hoover of \"leading the country down the path to socialism.\" And \"Cactus Jack\" was right. Terrified of the bogeyman that causes Ben Bernanke sleepless nights \u2013 deflation, falling prices \u2013 FDR ordered crops destroyed, pigs slaughtered, and business cartels to cut production and fix prices. FDR mistook the consequences of the Depression \u2013 falling prices \u2013 for the cause of the depression. But prices were simply returning to where they belonged in a free market, the first step in any cure. Obama is repeating the failed policies of Hoover and FDR, by refusing to let prices fall. Obama, with his intervention to prop up housing prices and Bernanke with his gushers of money to bail out bankrupt banks and businesses are creating a new bubble that will burst even more spectacularly.\" Here is the entire article: ---http://www.lewrockwell.com/buchanan/buchanan108.html Here is another article that is very interesting and shows that we will probably see a huge increase in inflation: ---http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig9/polleit2.html This message has been edited.
