I happened to watch a Captain almost get vaporized from a 130mm WP shell rigged as an IED. It was tied to a tree on our patrol route and he was about 5 feet from it when it went pop. We figured it hadnt been stored correctly in its cache as it low order detonated and the captain walked away without a scratch, but needing new shorts. *From ISAF (U) Discussion: Three means of white phosphorus use and access by insurgents can be identified: 1) improvised explosive devices 2) indirect fire attacks 3) ordnance caches or UXO. It is notable that the enemy has stockpiled and used white phosphorus in attacks since 2003 and as recently as the week prior to this release. It should also be noted that these instances have occurred in nearly every province in RC-East, which demonstrates the wide availability of white phosphorus to insurgents. Finally, it is important to note that insurgent stockpiles do not necessarily derive from old Soviet-era left-behind stocks; the white phosphorus munitions found in these 38 events have their origins in a wide range of countries. Also, the vast majority of white phosphorus rounds found in listed caches were determined to be in serviceable condition. 1.

I happened to watch a Captain almost get vaporized from a 130mm WP shell rigged as an IED. It was tied to a tree on our patrol route and he was about 5 feet from it when it went pop. We figured it hadnt been stored correctly in its cache as it low order detonated and the captain walked away without a scratch, but needing new shorts. *From ISAF (U) Discussion: Three means of white phosphorus use and access by insurgents can be identified: 1) improvised explosive devices 2) indirect fire attacks 3) ordnance caches or UXO. It is notable that the enemy has stockpiled and used white phosphorus in attacks since 2003 and as recently as the week prior to this release. It should also be noted that these instances have occurred in nearly every province in RC-East, which demonstrates the wide availability of white phosphorus to insurgents. Finally, it is important to note that insurgent stockpiles do not necessarily derive from old Soviet-era left-behind stocks; the white phosphorus munitions found in these 38 events have their origins in a wide range of countries. Also, the vast majority of white phosphorus rounds found in listed caches were determined to be in serviceable condition. 1.
