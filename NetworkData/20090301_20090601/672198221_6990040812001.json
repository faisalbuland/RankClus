The first and second bailouts were Federal Reserve bank actions ... the first, an 85 billion credit facility, was created under the auspices of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act ... the second was a line of $37.8 billion via a second secured asset credit facility created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
