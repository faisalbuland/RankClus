On Wednesday, 300,000 people (dangerous enough to be suspicious characters to the Department of Homeland Security) gather around America with barely a traffic ticket to show for it. Thursday, the media \u2014 undeterred \u2014 is continuing their push that this network, this audience and this host might be responsible for violence that might happen. This time, they focused their furious google searches on locating conservative critics of me. Guess what? They're not hard to find. I hack off conservatives just as much as liberals. (Well, maybe not quite as much\u2026 but a lot.) Today's Glenn Beck expert: Charles Johnson, a jazz musician, software programmer and writer for the blog \"Little Green Footballs.\" Johnson says: \"I don't know if he's necessarily going to incite violence, but I do think it's irresponsible. It kind of drags down the discourse to a level that I, for one, am not comfortable with.\" As evidence of this lowered discourse, he posted a video that supposedly showed a fan of mine yelling \"burn the books\" at a 9/12 project meeting. Only later, did someone do the two clicks of research that showed she was actually just a liberal there to make fun of the gathering. That's not really the point. There probably are a couple of stupid people at the meetings. There always will be stupid people saying stupid things. There will always be violent people doing violent things. But the insinuation that this network is somehow responsible or approving of anything violent is ludicrous and quite honestly a destructive attempt to silence free speech. That's something blogger Charles Johnson should know about, since he's been called an anti-Muslim bigot by most of the same people that unfairly said the same things about me. We've come to a place where we're not even playing a game of \"blame the messenger,\" it's a game of \"blame the messenger who's specifically saying the opposite message.\" That message \u2014 for the one trillionth time \u2014 is: If you are considering violence against anyone who isn't a pirate off the coast of Somalia, you are not only wrong, you are an enemy of the state and an enemy of freedom and liberty. The Founding Fathers fought and died for our freedom so that we would have the structure available to achieve change without doing the same. And you know that: 300,000 people peacefully gathered yesterday and honored our founders. That's why today, instead of an honest critique of the spending of Barack Obama, George W Bush and both sides of the aisle in Congress, you're getting non-stop \"tea bag\" jokes and accusations. It's almost like they want to distract you from what's really important. \"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,516901,00.html\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

As far as making our case poorly goes, you are probably right. Perhaps our point could have been made more clearly if we had utilized the Liberal protest playbook. Breaking shop windows, slashing tires, vandalizing police cars, blocking traffic, and throwing red paint on things would have drawn much more attention. I think our point was made in how peaceful our protests were. How many arrests did you hear about from the TEA Parties? How much violence was reported? Liberals talk about peace, unity, and acceptance. That is, unless it involves people with political views different than their own. There is nothing more scary than a \"peaceful\" liberal protest.

It's not censorship or a \"distraction\" when you made it very very poorly and people don't buy it. The TEA Parties weren't about Obama. They were in protest of high taxes and even higher government spending. I only mention President Bush because I can't think of many other things that Liberals protest about in those types of numbers. As far as making our case poorly goes, you are probably right. Perhaps our point could have been made more clearly if we had utilized the Liberal protest playbook. Breaking shop windows, slashing tires, vandalizing police cars, blocking traffic, and throwing red paint on things would have drawn much more attention. I think our point was made in how peaceful our protests were. How many arrests did you hear about from the TEA Parties? How much violence was reported? Liberals talk about peace, unity, and acceptance. That is, unless it involves people with political views different than their own. There is nothing more scary than a \"peaceful\" liberal protest. Just look at the G20 summit and Republican National Convention protests if you need an example.",
