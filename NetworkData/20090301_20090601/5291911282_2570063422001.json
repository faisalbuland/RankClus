It's so weird, the closer it gets to hubby coming home, the MORE I miss him! Strange thing is: He told me today, when we chatted, that this morning he woke up about 5am (his time), and couldn't figure out why, but wanted to get to a phone to call and check on me. I thought that was totally creepy!! Any of y'all ever have something like that happen, with a spouse or loved one??",

There are too many true stories about things like 'what you've experienced' that are recorded and be proven. I believe there is one such story about someone on the Titanic. Their loved one, in the US, woke in the night not knowing why but felt the urge to pray for their loved one at the exact same time the Titanic was going down. The person on the Titanic survived. I heard a missionary tell such a story about finding a snake coiled near their sleeping child in India. The grand parents in the US felt the need to pray for their grand child. The snake left before the child woke up. Weeks later they each wrote letters telling of their experiences, giving the exact date and time ... and sure enough they were at the exact same 'time in reality' while being hours (on the clock) different. I could tell ya bout an experience my wife and I had when I was at Fort Knox and she was on a retreat in Ohio, back in 1967 ... but it's too long of a story to tell here. You experienced it! You can believe it! You can call it what you wish! It happens all the time ... I believe more than we will ever know People have a hard time talking about these kind of things because those who 'don't believe in it' or have never experienced 'it' look at ya like you are a UFO nut.
