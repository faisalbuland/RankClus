Get this it's for busy parent to help train thier kids to go potty. It's called the I-POO'D and you can program the damn to at set times encourage yur child to go to the tolet and do his or her \"businees\". The whole time it offers encouragement and praise to the toddler. They're also talking a a future upgrade that will connect to you WI-FI and send out an email to a list of people you select indicating a sucessful trip to the bathroom. Incredible! What the hell, parents are soon going to be obsolete and replaced by 'puters and robots !!!???",
