        "content": "Dean Health nurse laid off mid-surgery By DEE J. HALL A Dean Health System manager removed a nurse from a minor surgical procedure last week \u2014 in violation of medical protocol \u2014 in order to lay her off, a spokesman for the company confirmed Monday. The abrupt removal, which spokesman Paul Pitas said posed no danger to the patient, came after the Madison-based health care provider announced Wednesday that it planned to \u201cimmediately\u201d lay off 90 employees. Pitas, director of corporate communications, labeled the action \u201cclearly ... an error in judgment on the part of the manager conducting the layoff.\u201d He declined to name the manager but described her as \u201can otherwise good employe with more than 30 years of nursing experience who made a regrettable decision.\u201d \u201cThis person is very upset and is extremely remorseful over this,\u201d Pitas said, adding that the layoffs created \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d Pitas said the incident occurred at Dean\u2019s West Clinic at 752 N. High Point Road on Wednesday or Thursday as employees were notified of the job cuts. He declined to name the employees involved or what type of procedure the nurse was assisting in when she was summoned from her duties and terminated. \u201cThere was a period of time in which an RN was not present during the procedure,\u201d Pitas said. \u201cWhile there were other clinical staff present, including a physician, the absence of an RN goes against established patient-care procedures at Dean Health System.\u201d He added that the patient, whose name is protected by patient confidentiality laws, is \u201cdoing fine.\u201d \u201cWe can tell you the physician who performed the procedure reports it went as expected,\u201d he said. Pitas said Dean plans to pursue the matter, but he declined to say what the possible outcomes could be. \u201cDean will continue to reiterate to its staff the importance of following all patient-care policies,\u201d he said. \u201cOut of respect for the (manager), we cannot discuss specifics. However, we can tell you we are looking into this, and appropriate action will be taken.\u201d The layoff affected 90 of the company\u2019s 4,500 employees and reportedly focused primarily on non-patient-care positions. The terminated employees were given severance packages including job counseling and payments based on years of service. Cheryl Koerwitz, a medical assistant who has worked for Dean for 14 years, described a stressful scene Wednesday at 10 a.m. in which Dean employees at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital were told some were being laid off, and that if a company representative returned later in the day, that meant one or more of them was being terminated. As it turned out, Koerwitz said, no one in her unit was laid off. However, the incident left her feeling \u201cthreatened and scared.\u201d Dean Health System runs dozens of area clinics and health-related entities, a health insurance company and a foundation. Of the layoffs, Craig Samitt, Dean Health System president said last week, \u201cWe do not feel patients will notice.\u201d madison.com/wsj/mad/top/446920",
