To be threatened here, on a site frequented by and dedicated to, veterans, makes me very sad. It makes me wonder if there is not some universal field of discourse in this country outside which no one is allowed. A recent thread I started merely points out that 81% of Americans are favorable to president Obama. You won't likely see that played up too much on FOX news or the other Republican Party organs that use Nazi -type- propaganda to make their talking points. I asked this on FreeReublic, both on threads and to the owner of FR, Jim Robinson, so I will post it here to the management of Military.com. Do you believe in reasonable free speech or not? Nothing I have posted in any way impinges even remotely on the way Free Speech has been seen in this country for 200+ years. Jim Robinson showed his respect for our most sacred institutions -- nil. We'll see what happens on this site. If you see me just drop off the screen entirely, you'll know that this site also does not respect the First Amendment. Walt",
