Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \u201cthe most blatant form of voter intimidation\u201d that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago.

He said that he had never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.
