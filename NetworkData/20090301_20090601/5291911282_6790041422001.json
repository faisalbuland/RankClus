But now it has gone back to 35. You must be IN Basic by that age, ie: not just signed up, but serving your first day. This is for non-prior service - prior service stayed the same, age 43. Remember, where one recruiter won't do for you, there are a million more that might. Don't stop looking at different recruiters until you find the one that will do anything to sign you up. But if you have never served and are 42, you're SOL. There is no branch that accepts trainees at that age today. You must be below 35 or prior service. Sorry, bro It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
