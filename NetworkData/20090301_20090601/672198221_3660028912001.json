The emergence of a predominantly right-wing, nationalist government in Israel suggests that there may be more violations to come. Hamas\u2019s indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians also constituted war crimes, but do not excuse Israel\u2019s transgressions. While Israel disputes some of the soldiers\u2019 accounts, the evidence suggests that Israel committed the following six offenses: \u2022 Violating its duty to protect the civilian population of the Gaza Strip. Despite Israel\u2019s 2005 \u201cdisengagement\u201d from Gaza, the territory remains occupied. Israel unleashed military firepower against a people it is legally bound to protect. \u2022 Imposing collective punishment in the form of a blockade, in violation of Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. In June 2007, after Hamas took power in the Gaza Strip, Israel imposed suffocating restrictions on trade and movement. The blockade \u2014 an act of war in customary international law \u2014 has helped plunge families into poverty, children into malnutrition, and patients denied access to medical treatment into their graves. People in Gaza thus faced Israel\u2019s winter onslaught in particularly weakened conditions. \u2022 Deliberately attacking civilian targets. The laws of war permit attacking a civilian object only when it is making an effective contribution to military action and a definite military advantage is gained by its destruction. Yet an Israeli general, Dan Harel, said, \u201cWe are hitting not only terrorists and launchers, but also the whole Hamas government and all its wings.\u201d An Israeli military spokeswoman, Maj. Avital Leibovich, avowed that \u201canything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target.\u201d Israeli fire destroyed or damaged mosques, hospitals, factories, schools, a key sewage plant, institutions like the parliament, the main ministries, the central prison and police stations, and thousands of houses. \u2022 Willfully killing civilians without military justification. When civilian institutions are struck, civilians \u2014 persons who are not members of the armed forces of a warring party, and are not taking direct part in hostilities \u2014 are killed. International law authorizes killings of civilians if the objective of the attack is military, and the means are proportional to the advantage gained. Yet proportionality is irrelevant if the targets of attack were not military to begin with. Gaza government employees \u2014 traffic policemen, court clerks, secretaries and others \u2014 are not combatants merely because Israel considers Hamas, the governing party, a terrorist organization. Many countries do not regard violence against foreign military occupation as terrorism. Of 1,434 Palestinians killed in the Gaza invasion, 960 were civilians, including 121 women and 288 children, according to a United Nations special rapporteur, Richard Falk. Israeli military lawyers instructed army commanders that Palestinians who remained in a targeted building after having been warned to leave were \u201cvoluntary human shields,\u201d and thus combatants. Israeli gunners \u201cknocked on roofs\u201d \u2014 that is, fired first at corners of buildings, before hitting more vulnerable points \u2014 to \u201cwarn\u201d Palestinian residents to flee. With nearly all exits from the densely populated Gaza Strip blocked by Israel, and chaos reigning within it, this was a particularly cruel flaunting of international law. Willful killings of civilians that are not required by military necessity are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and are considered war crimes under the Nuremberg principles. \u2022 Deliberately employing disproportionate force. Last year, Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, head of Israel\u2019s northern command, speaking on possible future conflicts with neighbors, stated, \u201cWe will wield disproportionate power against every village from which shots are fired on Israel, and cause immense damage and destruction.\u201d Such a frank admission of illegal intent can constitute evidence in a criminal prosecution. \u2022 Illegal use of weapons, including white phosphorus. Israel was finally forced to admit, after initial denials, that it employed white phosphorous in the Gaza Strip, though Israel defended its use as legal. White phosphorous may be legally used as an obscurant, not as a weapon, as it burns deeply and is extremely difficult to extinguish. Israeli political and military personnel who planned, ordered or executed these possible offenses should face criminal prosecution. The appointment of Richard Goldstone, the former war crimes prosecutor from South Africa, to head a fact-finding team into possible war crimes by both parties to the Gaza conflict is an important step in the right direction. The stature of international law is diminished when a nation violates it with impunity.

If by \"civilian targets\" you mean \"Hamas political government\", i must disappoint you. They are legal targets, much like Reichstag in ww2.

Now about article 33 of Geneva convention that you have chosen to quote. If you will look in Wikipedia you will see what it actually says-\"By collective punishment, the drafters of the Geneva Conventions had in mind the reprisal killings of World Wars I and II\". In case you did not know, it is very important what the drafters meant, because you have to interpret the convention in that way. Since blockade is an acceptable tool of warfare (blockade as is in \"no trading\") We can ignore protocol 2 as well. What we are required is to provide access to the goods to Gaza, and even that we can ignore, if these goods fall to the hands of the enemy (Hamas).

Hamas\u2019s indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians also constituted war crimes, but do not excuse Israel\u2019s transgressions. While Israel disputes some of the soldiers\u2019 accounts, the evidence suggests that Israel committed the following six offenses: \u2022 Violating its duty to protect the civilian population of the Gaza Strip. Despite Israel\u2019s 2005 \u201cdisengagement\u201d from Gaza, the territory remains occupied. Israel unleashed military firepower against a people it is legally bound to protect. \u2022 Imposing collective punishment in the form of a blockade, in violation of Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. In June 2007, after Hamas took power in the Gaza Strip, Israel imposed suffocating restrictions on trade and movement. The blockade \u2014 an act of war in customary international law \u2014 has helped plunge families into poverty, children into malnutrition, and patients denied access to medical treatment into their graves. People in Gaza thus faced Israel\u2019s winter onslaught in particularly weakened conditions. \u2022 Deliberately attacking civilian targets. The laws of war permit attacking a civilian object only when it is making an effective contribution to military action and a definite military advantage is gained by its destruction. Yet an Israeli general, Dan Harel, said, \u201cWe are hitting not only terrorists and launchers, but also the whole Hamas government and all its wings.\u201d An Israeli military spokeswoman, Maj. Avital Leibovich, avowed that \u201canything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target.\u201d Israeli fire destroyed or damaged mosques, hospitals, factories, schools, a key sewage plant, institutions like the parliament, the main ministries, the central prison and police stations, and thousands of houses. \u2022 Willfully killing civilians without military justification. When civilian institutions are struck, civilians \u2014 persons who are not members of the armed forces of a warring party, and are not taking direct part in hostilities \u2014 are killed. International law authorizes killings of civilians if the objective of the attack is military, and the means are proportional to the advantage gained. Yet proportionality is irrelevant if the targets of attack were not military to begin with. Gaza government employees \u2014 traffic policemen, court clerks, secretaries and others \u2014 are not combatants merely because Israel considers Hamas, the governing party, a terrorist organization. Many countries do not regard violence against foreign military occupation as terrorism. Of 1,434 Palestinians killed in the Gaza invasion, 960 were civilians, including 121 women and 288 children, according to a United Nations special rapporteur, Richard Falk. Israeli military lawyers instructed army commanders that Palestinians who remained in a targeted building after having been warned to leave were \u201cvoluntary human shields,\u201d and thus combatants. Israeli gunners \u201cknocked on roofs\u201d \u2014 that is, fired first at corners of buildings, before hitting more vulnerable points \u2014 to \u201cwarn\u201d Palestinian residents to flee. With nearly all exits from the densely populated Gaza Strip blocked by Israel, and chaos reigning within it, this was a particularly cruel flaunting of international law. Willful killings of civilians that are not required by military necessity are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and are considered war crimes under the Nuremberg principles. \u2022 Deliberately employing disproportionate force. Last year, Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, head of Israel\u2019s northern command, speaking on possible future conflicts with neighbors, stated, \u201cWe will wield disproportionate power against every village from which shots are fired on Israel, and cause immense damage and destruction.\u201d Such a frank admission of illegal intent can constitute evidence in a criminal prosecution. \u2022 Illegal use of weapons, including white phosphorus. Israel was finally forced to admit, after initial denials, that it employed white phosphorous in the Gaza Strip, though Israel defended its use as legal. White phosphorous may be legally used as an obscurant, not as a weapon, as it burns deeply and is extremely difficult to extinguish. Israeli political and military personnel who planned, ordered or executed these possible offenses should face criminal prosecution. The appointment of Richard Goldstone, the former war crimes prosecutor from South Africa, to head a fact-finding team into possible war crimes by both parties to the Gaza conflict is an important step in the right direction. The stature of international law is diminished when a nation violates it with impunity.

It's terrible, but that's life. The ones to blame are HAMAS- who hide behing children and women that are put to the line.

Like all rumors go, this \"rumor/news article\" grew bigger of its initial source. And yes, these \"Sources\" that you mention, are just one source really. It is Haarez article translated to English with different wording. Unless your \"Sources\" have done independent work (like interviewing the soldiers), they all count as one. It all has started with 2 idiots saying that \"Idf had done this and that\". NY and some other news hungry newspapers decided to capitalize on the event, and quoted Haarez, which published these 2 idiots words in the first place. During the \"Objective investigation\" done by NY and their ilk, the idiots were multiplied. NSNN-This is Israel News. Of course that it is in Hebrew. If foreign newspapers were not up to the task of publishing up-to date information, it is not my fault. As a matter of fact it is the fault of NY newspaper, because it does not give a follow up on the story, after publishing such an information. What US citizens that DO NOT know Hebrew are to understand? That IDF soldiers are headless Nazi Brutes? The only thing that i have found is here \"http://www.jewlicious.com/2009/03/idfs-military-advocate-general-closes-criminal-investigation-into-allegations-made-by-soldiers-about-gaza-offensive/\". It is NOT official news site, but it saves me the trouble to translate word for word the Hebrew article. Of course if you will find that NY HAS done a follow up, i will take my words back. Meanwhile, all i have to say, is that NY conduct is a classical case of unprofessional work, that can be only classified as a malpractice. You claim that \"i have not claimed such a thing\". Given your history of pointless Israel bashing, I do not and will not believe you. Edit: I have found one Newspaper that did have a follow up. \"http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2009/03/31/israeli_investigation_dismisses_charges_of_misconduct_in_gaza_war/\" Still, i wonder if Ny has done the same. \"http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/IDF_soldiers%27_account_of_Gaza_incursion_sparks_new_war_crimes_investigations\" As is seen from this link, there were only 2 idiots. How 2 turned out to be 12? Hmm.... Of course, Haarez is not without blame, but blind subsequent publishing is, in my opinion, even worse. This message has been edited.

Like all rumors go, this \"rumor/news article\" grew bigger of its initial source. And yes, these \"Sources\" that you mention, are just one source really. It is Haarez article translated to English with different wording. Unless your \"Sources\" have done independent work (like interviewing the soldiers), they all count as one. It all has started with 2 idiots saying that \"Idf had done this and that\". NY and some other news hungry newspapers decided to capitalize on the event, and quoted Haarez, which published these 2 idiots words in the first place. During the \"Objective investigation\" done by NY and their ilk, the idiots were multiplied. NSNN-This is Israel News. Of course that it is in Hebrew. If foreign newspapers were not up to the task of publishing up-to date information, it is not my fault. As a matter of fact it is the fault of NY newspaper, because it does not give a follow up on the story, after publishing such an information. What US citizens that DO NOT know Hebrew are to understand? That IDF soldiers are headless Nazi Brutes? The only thing that i have found is here \"http://www.jewlicious.com/2009/03/idfs-military-advocate-general-closes-criminal-investigation-into-allegations-made-by-soldiers-about-gaza-offensive/\". It is NOT official news site, but it saves me the trouble to translate word for word the Hebrew article. Of course if you will find that NY HAS done a follow up, i will take my words back. Meanwhile, all i have to say, is that NY conduct is a classical case of unprofessional work, that can be only classified as a malpractice. You claim that \"i have not claimed such a thing\". Given your history of pointless Israel bashing, I do not and will not believe you. Edit: I have found one Newspaper that did have a follow up. \"http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2009/03/31/israeli_investigation_dismisses_charges_of_misconduct_in_gaza_war/\" Still, i wonder if Ny has done the same. \"http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/IDF_soldiers%27_account_of_Gaza_incursion_sparks_new_war_crimes_investigations\" As is seen from this link, there were only 2 idiots. How 2 turned out to be 12? Hmm.... Of course, Haarez is not without blame, but blind subsequent publishing is, in my opinion, even worse. This message has been edited.

Hamas\u2019s indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians also constituted war crimes, but do not excuse Israel\u2019s transgressions.

Israel unleashed military firepower against a people it is legally bound to protect. \u2022 Imposing collective punishment in the form of a blockade, in violation of Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. In June 2007, after Hamas took power in the Gaza Strip, Israel imposed suffocating restrictions on trade and movement.

People in Gaza thus faced Israel\u2019s winter onslaught in particularly weakened conditions. \u2022 Deliberately attacking civilian targets. The laws of war permit attacking a civilian object only when it is making an effective contribution to military action and a definite military advantage is gained by its destruction. Yet an Israeli general, Dan Harel, said, \u201cWe are hitting not only terrorists and launchers, but also the whole Hamas government and all its wings.\u201d An Israeli military spokeswoman, Maj. Avital Leibovich, avowed that \u201canything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target.\u201d Israeli fire destroyed or damaged mosques, hospitals, factories, schools, a key sewage plant, institutions like the parliament, the main ministries, the central prison and police stations, and thousands of houses. \u2022 Willfully killing civilians without military justification. When civilian institutions are struck, civilians \u2014 persons who are not members of the armed forces of a warring party, and are not taking direct part in hostilities \u2014 are killed. International law authorizes killings of civilians if the objective of the attack is military, and the means are proportional to the advantage gained. Yet proportionality is irrelevant if the targets of attack were not military to begin with. Gaza government employees \u2014 traffic policemen, court clerks, secretaries and others \u2014 are not combatants merely because Israel considers Hamas, the governing party, a terrorist organization. Many countries do not regard violence against foreign military occupation as terrorism. Of 1,434 Palestinians killed in the Gaza invasion, 960 were civilians, including 121 women and 288 children, according to a United Nations special rapporteur, Richard Falk. Israeli military lawyers instructed army commanders that Palestinians who remained in a targeted building after having been warned to leave were \u201cvoluntary human shields,\u201d and thus combatants. Israeli gunners \u201cknocked on roofs\u201d \u2014 that is, fired first at corners of buildings, before hitting more vulnerable points \u2014 to \u201cwarn\u201d Palestinian residents to flee. With nearly all exits from the densely populated Gaza Strip blocked by Israel, and chaos reigning within it, this was a particularly cruel flaunting of international law. Willful killings of civilians that are not required by military necessity are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and are considered war crimes under the Nuremberg principles. \u2022 Deliberately employing disproportionate force. Last year, Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, head of Israel\u2019s northern command, speaking on possible future conflicts with neighbors, stated, \u201cWe will wield disproportionate power against every village from which shots are fired on Israel, and cause immense damage and destruction.\u201d Such a frank admission of illegal intent can constitute evidence in a criminal prosecution. \u2022 Illegal use of weapons, including white phosphorus. Israel was finally forced to admit, after initial denials, that it employed white phosphorous in the Gaza Strip, though Israel defended its use as legal. White phosphorous may be legally used as an obscurant, not as a weapon, as it burns deeply and is extremely difficult to extinguish. Israeli political and military personnel who planned, ordered or executed these possible offenses should face criminal prosecution. The appointment of Richard Goldstone, the former war crimes prosecutor from South Africa, to head a fact-finding team into possible war crimes by both parties to the Gaza conflict is an important step in the right direction. The stature of international law is diminished when a nation violates it with impunity.

It have been proved as crap. Both of them admit that they have not seen anything, and all they have is hearsay. link We are not legally bound to protect anyone in Gaza. To all purposes it is almost another nation. It has its flag, its government, and much more of \"state's attributes\". If we wre bound to protect it, we should have been its government, because it is a task of the government to protect its populace. Gazans are not ours, we have made it clear in 2006. We are bound to minimize civilian losses, and that what we have done there. Do you realize that if we have NOT exercised restraint, Gaza would have been hole in the ground after 1 hour? If by \"civilian targets\" you mean \"Hamas political government\", i must disappoint you. They are legal targets, much like Reichstag in ww2. Killing Hania during the fighting would have been legal act, much like killing Hitler. Mr. Falk is not a unbiased source, so qouting him will not accomplish much. IDF has other numbers. Out of 1300 dead, 900 or so (As far as i remember) were terrorists. \"Deliberately employing disproportionate force.\" Gee, explain to me what is a proportionate one. Should we have shot at them with our quassams? We have used WP rounds as an obscurant. You have yet to prove that we have used it DELIBERATELY on \"civilian population\". Should i tell you what really happened in Gaza from my personal experiences? You know, pillow kids, 10 year's old with RPG and so on. Mr. Falk and NY times fail to mention it. Now about article 33 of Geneva convention that you have chosen to quote. If you will look in Wikipedia you will see what it actually says-\"By collective punishment, the drafters of the Geneva Conventions had in mind the reprisal killings of World Wars I and II\". In case you did not know, it is very important what the drafters meant, because you have to interpret the convention in that way. Since blockade is an acceptable tool of warfare (blockade as is in \"no trading\") We can ignore protocol 2 as well. What we are required is to provide access to the goods to Gaza, and even that we can ignore, if these goods fall to the hands of the enemy (Hamas). Since that has already happened, we can starve them all, in a completely legal way. This message has been edited. Last edited by: PanzerMeister, Sun 05 April 2009 07:14 AM",

To all purposes it is almost another nation. It has its flag, its government, and much more of \"state's attributes\". If we wre bound to protect it, we should have been its government, because it is a task of the government to protect its populace. Gazans are not ours, we have made it clear in 2006. We are bound to minimize civilian losses, and that what we have done there. Do you realize that if we have NOT exercised restraint, Gaza would have been hole in the ground after 1 hour? If by \"civilian targets\" you mean \"Hamas political government\", i must disappoint you. They are legal targets, much like Reichstag in ww2.
