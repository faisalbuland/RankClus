More importantly, my hand was getting tired from holding a flashlight. My bedtime was 2100 during school night and my dad, an Air Force Colonel, usually did a bed check at 2200. I had just completed seventh grade during which one teacher made us, and I hated to be made to do anything, read Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Old Man and The Sea.\u201d Once I did start, I could not put it down. The simplicity of Mr. Hemingway\u2019s style just caught my fancy. The 93 page novelette was a breeze and joy to read, even for a non-reader like me. \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d had to be reserved at the Hanscom Air Force Base library, which my mother did and my dad picked up a few days later. I asked to be excused from the dinner table early and skipped TV to get started. By lights out, I was well into the meet of the booked and hiding under my blanket with a flashlight gave me hope I could finish it that night. But I couldn\u2019t. I was disappointed because the next day, July 2, 1961, was a day long trip to Boston for the New England Regional Judo Tournament. The Huntley-Brinkley Report headliner that night was the suicide of Ernest Hemingway, which left an ever nagging question in my mind. Why? Why would a Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winner kill himself. He was an accomplished wordsmith who garnered the two most coveted awards for a writer. People who have the world in their palm just don\u2019t do that kind of thing...at least not in the mind of a 14 year old. Forty-seven- years later, the Hemingway question still haunted me. The works of Master Hemingway kept coming up especially as I delved deeper into the research for my book, \u201cThe Ghost in the Orange Closet.\u201d There was nothing strange about Hemingway popping up when you look at Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls,\u201d \u201cFarewell to Arms,\u201d and \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Home\u201d most certainly are excellent examples where characters suffered from PTSD. A Google search of \u201cHemingway and PTSD\u201d found more than 16,000 hits all mentioning things related to wounds you cannot see. By chance, I ran across his biography, which at first seemed to answer my protracted and nagging question. Several accidents late in his life left him, for the most part, incapacitated and unable to continue his writing. The suicide made sense when you think about this strong willed and hardy individual who loved big game hunting. This man was no scrawny wimp; he lived a life filled with machismo. His way out was reasonable. Yet, researching PTSD leads to a different nagging question of what killed Hemingway. Hemingway\u2019s view on war is well documented and his rather stark statement, \u201cThere is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter,\u201d makes you believe he knew something about war and its delayed effects. His experience as an ambulance driver in World War I was, to say the least, extremely traumatic for a young man of eighteen. As soon as he arrived at the Italian front, he experienced the horrors of war, having to pick up the remains of mostly female casualties. Just a few days later, he was wounded by an Austrian Trench Mortar and machinegun fire. It appears reasonable his bout with alcohol, chronic depression, and four marriages can be attributed to those heroic and troublesome experiences. Many who suffer from the \u201cunseen wounds of PTSD\u201d have difficulty maintaining long-term relationships; a glaring statistic from the Vietnam War. Additionally, there is a history of suicides in the Hemingway family. His father, brother, and other closely related family members (granddaughter Margaux Hemingway 1999) took their lives. This history adds an additional factor to support PTSD. Very recent research points to genetics being involved. So, did PTSD kill Hemingway? I\u2019ve lived most of my life with a nagging Hemingway question. And even though the question has changed from \u201cWhy\u201d to \u201cWhat,\u201d it appears it will be with me for a while longer, still nagging me\u2026to be sure! TL Criser",

When I was almost 13, my Dad was PCS'd to MAAG-Spain, and we crossed the Atlantic on the USS Constitution - with Ernest and Mary Hemingway. They were headed back to Spain for the first time (for him) since the Spanish Civil War. He flirted with my Mom (who looked a bit like Miss Mary), and was very friendly. This was 1959. Naturally, those of us in high school English classes in Spain were drawn to Hemingway - encouraged by a terrific teacher. I read most everything he wrote and copied his style for years (not well enough it seems, or I'd be having lunch with John Grisham now and then). If you read more about him and especially his family, depression is a condition that is a common thread. He had several episodes of what today would be termed Major Depression, Recurrent according to the DSM-IV. Numerous family members (parent, uncle or aunt, others) committed suicide. There is enough research to establish at least some familial link for depression and suicide - and having family members who committed suicide is considered a significant risk factor. The closer the relative, the higher the risk. Even one of his granddaughters committed suicide - though I can't remember if it was Mariel or Margaux. When he died by his own hand, I was very sad ... but can't say I was all that shocked, even though I was only a teenager at the time. PTSD? Possibly. His experiences in WWI, the Spanish Civil War and WWII didn't help, and could have added to the psychological burden he was already carrying. I wouldn't go so far as to put it all on PTSD ... I'm more inclined to attribute the end to a long history of depression off and on throughout his life, exacerbated by health and creativity problems. An excellent source for Hemingway material is A.E. Hotchner, a long-time friend of Hemingway's who was also Paul Newman's partner in the \"Newman's Own\" line of products - they were neighbors in CN.",

For one, he is one of my \"heroes.\" Secondly, my father, who was much like him, also shot himself - - Now, if ya don't want to get bored, switch to another thread, or just make a \"reply\" in another direction and ignore the following>>> Hemingway wrote in a style know as \"Existentialism,\" which was somewhat of a reaction to, but not a refutation of \"Mechanistic Determinism\" more exemplified by writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his Great Gatsby. Both were spin-offs of \"Realism/Naturalism\" made famous by the likes of Jack London and his Call of the Wild/White Fang books. Now, how does this all fit together and cause Hemingway's death? \"Realism/Naturalism\", driven by the coldness brought into the world by Darwin's concepts of Natural Selection/Survival of the Fittest rejected the kindhearted, sugary view of nature and the world painted by the Romantics and instead embraced the harsh, \"claws out and fangs ready\" picture of both nature and man, trying to show all aspects of human existence in the coldest, hardest, meanest, disinterested perspectives available. Witness the harsh treatment of both men and beasts in Jack London's book, but in order to be very true, the author had to experience every aspect of his story before writing it. Not too surprisingly that many of these early Realist authors started out as on-the-spot newspaper reporters like Stephen Crane ( Red Badge of Courage). These realists also REJECTED the idea that there was a \"caring God\" who tried to help people or even cared about them at all. People survived by their wits or died because of their stupidity (London's To Build a Fire, but it all means nothing. Out of this \"meaninglessness\" comes \"Mechanistic Determinism\" - the idea that there are gigantic unseen, uncaring forces controlling the lives of mankind: Gravity, meteor strikes, earthquakes, wars, giant corporations of banks, oil, railroads, giant governments, giant businesses, stock markets, storms, climate changes - all scientifically predictable, but none of which can the individual comprehend, much less control - which control him, push him, beat him down, destroy him - possibly watching with large, cold, uncaring eyes ! (Witness the large, cold, spectacled, always-watching eyes on the Billboard in \"Great Gatsby.\") Mechanistic Determinism says that the individual, no matter what he does, will always be battered, pounded down, destroyed by these forces, no matter what he does or thinks, without remorse. Thus, it creates a kind of predictable \"fate\" but never a triumphant one - always failure, always tragic, always grey and dark, and the Great Depression seemed to confirm it so Terribly (Witness John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, etc.) Hemingway rejected some of this, but not all. He was certainly steeped in Mechanistic Determinism, but he did not totally reject the old Romantic idea of the Noble Hero. Thus, he went into \"Existentialism\" which accepted the concept of Mechanistic Determinism that the Individual is up against giant forces he will never understand, or comprehend, or defeat - and he will eventually be crushed and destroyed - but the thing that gives a human his greatness, his dignity, his honor, and his nobility is HOW He determines to exist that he never has to give up fighting! He can say \"Fxvxvk This!\" and fight all the forces, kicking and screaming, to the bitter end... Thus \"Existentialism\"!! And if you think about all of Hemingway's characters of any worth, that's what they do - they fight, get crushed, fight more, get crushed more - and are finally destroyed...never quite knowing what they had fought, and what had destroyed them...but they never quit - to that last \"spit-in-the-eye\" moment, before fading into what seems a meaningless end of nothingness and death. Witness The Old Man and the Sea - the old fisherman dreaming of lions free on a distant beach as he dies on his filthy bunk, while the skeleton of his giant shark eaten fish washing on the beach - a symbol of lost battles and futility, but also his un-witnessed refusal to quit, and his grizzled nobility... And Hemingway seemed to live that life, tasting it, being it, fighting, scrambling, winning, losing, accumulating, wasting - but always on the very edge of the spear, the razor's edge of LIFE! - - Then he killed himself, and everyone yelled \"Traitor!\" because they felt he had given up, that he was a phony, that he hadn't fought to the end. And I was one who thought that - until my father shot himself. Until I studied Hemingway's battle with cancer - until I traveled to, and stayed at Ketchum, Idaho to think about it - - And then, I understood. Cancer is just one more of those incomprehensible giant monsters that rip down, tear away, butcher and maim, so is Depression, and Alzheimers, and Palsy, and all the other maladies that can grip a man in his old age and beat him down, and crush him piece buy piece and destroy him like an uncaring scientist looking at a bug through magnifying glasses while cutting it coldly to pieces... But what can a man do at that moment to retain his self determination and self worth which the bug cannot do?? He can say, \"FvxvxK This!!\" and take the moment back into his own hands, in defiance of every !@#$#%%^&* gigantic force out there, and make the finally decision and determination of his outcome himself! - - None! No one, nor no thing killed Hemingway but Hemingway! He, not some unseen force, made the final choice - - - - -Invictus- - - Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find me, unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul. Yup - just the thoughts of a bullshyyt wander, lost on planet Earth - - Wandering and Wondering",

Out of this \"meaninglessness\" comes \"Mechanistic Determinism\" - the idea that there are gigantic unseen, uncaring forces controlling the lives of mankind: Gravity, meteor strikes, earthquakes, wars, giant corporations of banks, oil, railroads, giant governments, giant businesses, stock markets, storms, climate changes - all scientifically predictable, but none of which can the individual comprehend, much less control - which control him, push him, beat him down, destroy him - possibly watching with large, cold, uncaring eyes ! (Witness the large, cold, spectacled, always-watching eyes on the Billboard in \"Great Gatsby.\") Mechanistic Determinism says that the individual, no matter what he does, will always be battered, pounded down, destroyed by these forces, no matter what he does or thinks, without remorse. Thus, it creates a kind of predictable \"fate\" but never a triumphant one - always failure, always tragic, always grey and dark, and the Great Depression seemed to confirm it so Terribly (Witness John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, etc.) Hemingway rejected some of this, but not all. He was certainly steeped in Mechanistic Determinism, but he did not totally reject the old Romantic idea of the Noble Hero. Thus, he went into \"Existentialism\" which accepted the concept of Mechanistic Determinism that the Individual is up against giant forces he will never understand, or comprehend, or defeat - and he will eventually be crushed and destroyed - but the thing that gives a human his greatness, his dignity, his honor, and his nobility is HOW He determines to exist that he never has to give up fighting! He can say \"Fxvxvk This!\" and fight all the forces, kicking and screaming, to the bitter end... Thus \"Existentialism\"!! And if you think about all of Hemingway's characters of any worth, that's what they do - they fight, get crushed, fight more, get crushed more - and are finally destroyed...never quite knowing what they had fought, and what had destroyed them...but they never quit - to that last \"spit-in-the-eye\" moment, before fading into what seems a meaningless end of nothingness and death. Witness The Old Man and the Sea - the old fisherman dreaming of lions free on a distant beach as he dies on his filthy bunk, while the skeleton of his giant shark eaten fish washing on the beach - a symbol of lost battles and futility, but also his un-witnessed refusal to quit, and his grizzled nobility... And Hemingway seemed to live that life, tasting it, being it, fighting, scrambling, winning, losing, accumulating, wasting - but always on the very edge of the spear, the razor's edge of LIFE! - - Then he killed himself, and everyone yelled \"Traitor!\" because they felt he had given up, that he was a phony, that he hadn't fought to the end. And I was one who thought that - until my father shot himself. Until I studied Hemingway's battle with cancer - until I traveled to, and stayed at Ketchum, Idaho to think about it - - And then, I understood. Cancer is just one more of those incomprehensible giant monsters that rip down, tear away, butcher and maim, so is Depression, and Alzheimers, and Palsy, and all the other maladies that can grip a man in his old age and beat him down, and crush him piece buy piece and destroy him like an uncaring scientist looking at a bug through magnifying glasses while cutting it coldly to pieces... But what can a man do at that moment to retain his self determination and self worth which the bug cannot do?? He can say, \"FvxvxK This!!\" and take the moment back into his own hands, in defiance of every !@#$#%%^&* gigantic force out there, and make the finally decision and determination of his outcome himself! - - None! No one, nor no thing killed Hemingway but Hemingway! He, not some unseen force, made the final choice - - - - -Invictus- - - Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.

He, not some unseen force, made the final choice - - - - -Invictus- - - Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find me, unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul.

        "content": "Hi everyone, I was reading your post and realised that I really did not know much about the back ground of Ernest Hemingway other than he was a writer, so I looked him up and this was the bio I found and thought I would share with you what they said... Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), born in Oak Park, Illinois, started his career as a writer in a newspaper office in Kansas City at the age of seventeen. After the United States entered the First World War, he joined a volunteer ambulance unit in the Italian army. Serving at the front, he was wounded, was decorated by the Italian Government, and spent considerable time in hospitals. After his return to the United States, he became a reporter for Canadian and American newspapers and was soon sent back to Europe to cover such events as the Greek Revolution. During the twenties, Hemingway became a member of the group of expatriate Americans in Paris, which he described in his first important work, The Sun Also Rises (1926). Equally successful was A Farewell to Arms (1929), the study of an American ambulance officer's disillusionment in the war and his role as a deserter. Hemingway used his experiences as a reporter during the civil war in Spain as the background for his most ambitious novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Among his later works, the most outstanding is the short novel, The Old Man and the Sea (1952), the story of an old fisherman's journey, his long and lonely struggle with a fish and the sea, and his victory in defeat. Hemingway - himself a great sportsman - liked to portray soldiers, hunters, bullfighters - tough, at times primitive people whose courage and honesty are set against the brutal ways of modern society, and who in this confrontation lose hope and faith. His straightforward prose, his spare dialogue, and his predilection for understatement are particularly effective in his short stories, some of which are collected in Men Without Women (1927) and The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories (1938). Hemingway died in Idaho in 1961. ..........just wondering if you think the fact he wrote about his subjects losing faith all the time makes you think he once believed in God himself? But do you really believe in God if you doubt him when something bad happens? How would you define faith? Is it unconditional love? Is it never to question why? Is it fear of the unknown? I have often wondered why bad things happen, have you?",

        "content": "On my nightstand was a half finished \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\u201d I tried to read the entire book in one night, but around 0200 my eyes just would not stay open anymore. More importantly, my hand was getting tired from holding a flashlight. My bedtime was 2100 during school night and my dad, an Air Force Colonel, usually did a bed check at 2200. I had just completed seventh grade during which one teacher made us, and I hated to be made to do anything, read Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Old Man and The Sea.\u201d Once I did start, I could not put it down. The simplicity of Mr. Hemingway\u2019s style just caught my fancy. The 93 page novelette was a breeze and joy to read, even for a non-reader like me. \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d had to be reserved at the Hanscom Air Force Base library, which my mother did and my dad picked up a few days later. I asked to be excused from the dinner table early and skipped TV to get started. By lights out, I was well into the meet of the booked and hiding under my blanket with a flashlight gave me hope I could finish it that night. But I couldn\u2019t. I was disappointed because the next day, July 2, 1961, was a day long trip to Boston for the New England Regional Judo Tournament. The Huntley-Brinkley Report headliner that night was the suicide of Ernest Hemingway, which left an ever nagging question in my mind. Why? Why would a Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winner kill himself. He was an accomplished wordsmith who garnered the two most coveted awards for a writer. People who have the world in their palm just don\u2019t do that kind of thing...at least not in the mind of a 14 year old. Forty-seven- years later, the Hemingway question still haunted me. The works of Master Hemingway kept coming up especially as I delved deeper into the research for my book, \u201cThe Ghost in the Orange Closet.\u201d There was nothing strange about Hemingway popping up when you look at Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls,\u201d \u201cFarewell to Arms,\u201d and \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Home\u201d most certainly are excellent examples where characters suffered from PTSD. A Google search of \u201cHemingway and PTSD\u201d found more than 16,000 hits all mentioning things related to wounds you cannot see. By chance, I ran across his biography, which at first seemed to answer my protracted and nagging question. Several accidents late in his life left him, for the most part, incapacitated and unable to continue his writing. The suicide made sense when you think about this strong willed and hardy individual who loved big game hunting. This man was no scrawny wimp; he lived a life filled with machismo. His way out was reasonable. Yet, researching PTSD leads to a different nagging question of what killed Hemingway. Hemingway\u2019s view on war is well documented and his rather stark statement, \u201cThere is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter,\u201d makes you believe he knew something about war and its delayed effects. His experience as an ambulance driver in World War I was, to say the least, extremely traumatic for a young man of eighteen. As soon as he arrived at the Italian front, he experienced the horrors of war, having to pick up the remains of mostly female casualties. Just a few days later, he was wounded by an Austrian Trench Mortar and machinegun fire. It appears reasonable his bout with alcohol, chronic depression, and four marriages can be attributed to those heroic and troublesome experiences. Many who suffer from the \u201cunseen wounds of PTSD\u201d have difficulty maintaining long-term relationships; a glaring statistic from the Vietnam War. Additionally, there is a history of suicides in the Hemingway family. His father, brother, and other closely related family members (granddaughter Margaux Hemingway 1999) took their lives. This history adds an additional factor to support PTSD. Very recent research points to genetics being involved. So, did PTSD kill Hemingway? I\u2019ve lived most of my life with a nagging Hemingway question. And even though the question has changed from \u201cWhy\u201d to \u201cWhat,\u201d it appears it will be with me for a while longer, still nagging me\u2026to be sure! TL Criser",

When I was almost 13, my Dad was PCS'd to MAAG-Spain, and we crossed the Atlantic on the USS Constitution - with Ernest and Mary Hemingway. They were headed back to Spain for the first time (for him) since the Spanish Civil War. He flirted with my Mom (who looked a bit like Miss Mary), and was very friendly. This was 1959. Naturally, those of us in high school English classes in Spain were drawn to Hemingway - encouraged by a terrific teacher. I read most everything he wrote and copied his style for years (not well enough it seems, or I'd be having lunch with John Grisham now and then). If you read more about him and especially his family, depression is a condition that is a common thread. He had several episodes of what today would be termed Major Depression, Recurrent according to the DSM-IV. Numerous family members (parent, uncle or aunt, others) committed suicide. There is enough research to establish at least some familial link for depression and suicide - and having family members who committed suicide is considered a significant risk factor. The closer the relative, the higher the risk. Even one of his granddaughters committed suicide - though I can't remember if it was Mariel or Margaux. When he died by his own hand, I was very sad ... but can't say I was all that shocked, even though I was only a teenager at the time. PTSD? Possibly. His experiences in WWI, the Spanish Civil War and WWII didn't help, and could have added to the psychological burden he was already carrying. I wouldn't go so far as to put it all on PTSD ... I'm more inclined to attribute the end to a long history of depression off and on throughout his life, exacerbated by health and creativity problems. An excellent source for Hemingway material is A.E. Hotchner, a long-time friend of Hemingway's who was also Paul Newman's partner in the \"Newman's Own\" line of products - they were neighbors in CN.",

I was in Ketchum once and someone pointed it out to me. Hadn't even read Hemingway yet so it made no difference. Nope, pushed it with his big toe - - Now, if you REALLY want to know what killed Hemingway - I'll try to explain it to you...very sympathetically for several reasons. For one, he is one of my \"heroes.\" Secondly, my father, who was much like him, also shot himself - - Now, if ya don't want to get bored, switch to another thread, or just make a \"reply\" in another direction and ignore the following>>> Hemingway wrote in a style know as \"Existentialism,\" which was somewhat of a reaction to, but not a refutation of \"Mechanistic Determinism\" more exemplified by writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his Great Gatsby. Both were spin-offs of \"Realism/Naturalism\" made famous by the likes of Jack London and his Call of the Wild/White Fang books. Now, how does this all fit together and cause Hemingway's death? \"Realism/Naturalism\", driven by the coldness brought into the world by Darwin's concepts of Natural Selection/Survival of the Fittest rejected the kindhearted, sugary view of nature and the world painted by the Romantics and instead embraced the harsh, \"claws out and fangs ready\" picture of both nature and man, trying to show all aspects of human existence in the coldest, hardest, meanest, disinterested perspectives available. Witness the harsh treatment of both men and beasts in Jack London's book, but in order to be very true, the author had to experience every aspect of his story before writing it. Not too surprisingly that many of these early Realist authors started out as on-the-spot newspaper reporters like Stephen Crane ( Red Badge of Courage). These realists also REJECTED the idea that there was a \"caring God\" who tried to help people or even cared about them at all. People survived by their wits or died because of their stupidity (London's To Build a Fire, but it all means nothing. Out of this \"meaninglessness\" comes \"Mechanistic Determinism\" - the idea that there are gigantic unseen, uncaring forces controlling the lives of mankind: Gravity, meteor strikes, earthquakes, wars, giant corporations of banks, oil, railroads, giant governments, giant businesses, stock markets, storms, climate changes - all scientifically predictable, but none of which can the individual comprehend, much less control - which control him, push him, beat him down, destroy him - possibly watching with large, cold, uncaring eyes ! (Witness the large, cold, spectacled, always-watching eyes on the Billboard in \"Great Gatsby.\") Mechanistic Determinism says that the individual, no matter what he does, will always be battered, pounded down, destroyed by these forces, no matter what he does or thinks, without remorse. Thus, it creates a kind of predictable \"fate\" but never a triumphant one - always failure, always tragic, always grey and dark, and the Great Depression seemed to confirm it so Terribly (Witness John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, etc.) Hemingway rejected some of this, but not all. He was certainly steeped in Mechanistic Determinism, but he did not totally reject the old Romantic idea of the Noble Hero. Thus, he went into \"Existentialism\" which accepted the concept of Mechanistic Determinism that the Individual is up against giant forces he will never understand, or comprehend, or defeat - and he will eventually be crushed and destroyed - but the thing that gives a human his greatness, his dignity, his honor, and his nobility is HOW He determines to exist that he never has to give up fighting! He can say \"Fxvxvk This!\" and fight all the forces, kicking and screaming, to the bitter end... Thus \"Existentialism\"!! And if you think about all of Hemingway's characters of any worth, that's what they do - they fight, get crushed, fight more, get crushed more - and are finally destroyed...never quite knowing what they had fought, and what had destroyed them...but they never quit - to that last \"spit-in-the-eye\" moment, before fading into what seems a meaningless end of nothingness and death. Witness The Old Man and the Sea - the old fisherman dreaming of lions free on a distant beach as he dies on his filthy bunk, while the skeleton of his giant shark eaten fish washing on the beach - a symbol of lost battles and futility, but also his un-witnessed refusal to quit, and his grizzled nobility... And Hemingway seemed to live that life, tasting it, being it, fighting, scrambling, winning, losing, accumulating, wasting - but always on the very edge of the spear, the razor's edge of LIFE! - - Then he killed himself, and everyone yelled \"Traitor!\" because they felt he had given up, that he was a phony, that he hadn't fought to the end. And I was one who thought that - until my father shot himself. Until I studied Hemingway's battle with cancer - until I traveled to, and stayed at Ketchum, Idaho to think about it - - And then, I understood. Cancer is just one more of those incomprehensible giant monsters that rip down, tear away, butcher and maim, so is Depression, and Alzheimers, and Palsy, and all the other maladies that can grip a man in his old age and beat him down, and crush him piece buy piece and destroy him like an uncaring scientist looking at a bug through magnifying glasses while cutting it coldly to pieces... But what can a man do at that moment to retain his self determination and self worth which the bug cannot do?? He can say, \"FvxvxK This!!\" and take the moment back into his own hands, in defiance of every !@#$#%%^&* gigantic force out there, and make the finally decision and determination of his outcome himself! - - None! No one, nor no thing killed Hemingway but Hemingway! He, not some unseen force, made the final choice - - - - -Invictus- - - Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.

Scott Fitzgerald, and his Great Gatsby. Both were spin-offs of \"Realism/Naturalism\" made famous by the likes of Jack London and his Call of the Wild/White Fang books. Now, how does this all fit together and cause Hemingway's death? \"Realism/Naturalism\", driven by the coldness brought into the world by Darwin's concepts of Natural Selection/Survival of the Fittest rejected the kindhearted, sugary view of nature and the world painted by the Romantics and instead embraced the harsh, \"claws out and fangs ready\" picture of both nature and man, trying to show all aspects of human existence in the coldest, hardest, meanest, disinterested perspectives available. Witness the harsh treatment of both men and beasts in Jack London's book, but in order to be very true, the author had to experience every aspect of his story before writing it. Not too surprisingly that many of these early Realist authors started out as on-the-spot newspaper reporters like Stephen Crane ( Red Badge of Courage). These realists also REJECTED the idea that there was a \"caring God\" who tried to help people or even cared about them at all. People survived by their wits or died because of their stupidity (London's To Build a Fire, but it all means nothing. Out of this \"meaninglessness\" comes \"Mechanistic Determinism\" - the idea that there are gigantic unseen, uncaring forces controlling the lives of mankind: Gravity, meteor strikes, earthquakes, wars, giant corporations of banks, oil, railroads, giant governments, giant businesses, stock markets, storms, climate changes - all scientifically predictable, but none of which can the individual comprehend, much less control - which control him, push him, beat him down, destroy him - possibly watching with large, cold, uncaring eyes ! (Witness the large, cold, spectacled, always-watching eyes on the Billboard in \"Great Gatsby.\") Mechanistic Determinism says that the individual, no matter what he does, will always be battered, pounded down, destroyed by these forces, no matter what he does or thinks, without remorse. Thus, it creates a kind of predictable \"fate\" but never a triumphant one - always failure, always tragic, always grey and dark, and the Great Depression seemed to confirm it so Terribly (Witness John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, etc.) Hemingway rejected some of this, but not all. He was certainly steeped in Mechanistic Determinism, but he did not totally reject the old Romantic idea of the Noble Hero. Thus, he went into \"Existentialism\" which accepted the concept of Mechanistic Determinism that the Individual is up against giant forces he will never understand, or comprehend, or defeat - and he will eventually be crushed and destroyed - but the thing that gives a human his greatness, his dignity, his honor, and his nobility is HOW He determines to exist that he never has to give up fighting! He can say \"Fxvxvk This!\" and fight all the forces, kicking and screaming, to the bitter end... Thus \"Existentialism\"!! And if you think about all of Hemingway's characters of any worth, that's what they do - they fight, get crushed, fight more, get crushed more - and are finally destroyed...never quite knowing what they had fought, and what had destroyed them...but they never quit - to that last \"spit-in-the-eye\" moment, before fading into what seems a meaningless end of nothingness and death. Witness The Old Man and the Sea - the old fisherman dreaming of lions free on a distant beach as he dies on his filthy bunk, while the skeleton of his giant shark eaten fish washing on the beach - a symbol of lost battles and futility, but also his un-witnessed refusal to quit, and his grizzled nobility... And Hemingway seemed to live that life, tasting it, being it, fighting, scrambling, winning, losing, accumulating, wasting - but always on the very edge of the spear, the razor's edge of LIFE! - - Then he killed himself, and everyone yelled \"Traitor!\" because they felt he had given up, that he was a phony, that he hadn't fought to the end. And I was one who thought that - until my father shot himself. Until I studied Hemingway's battle with cancer - until I traveled to, and stayed at Ketchum, Idaho to think about it - - And then, I understood. Cancer is just one more of those incomprehensible giant monsters that rip down, tear away, butcher and maim, so is Depression, and Alzheimers, and Palsy, and all the other maladies that can grip a man in his old age and beat him down, and crush him piece buy piece and destroy him like an uncaring scientist looking at a bug through magnifying glasses while cutting it coldly to pieces... But what can a man do at that moment to retain his self determination and self worth which the bug cannot do?? He can say, \"FvxvxK This!!\" and take the moment back into his own hands, in defiance of every !@#$#%%^&* gigantic force out there, and make the finally decision and determination of his outcome himself! - - None! No one, nor no thing killed Hemingway but Hemingway! He, not some unseen force, made the final choice - - - - -Invictus- - - Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find me, unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul.

        "quote": "Originally posted by greywolfghost: quote: Originally posted by sargeant_green: No it was a shotgun that killed Ernest. He just helped it into position and pulled the trigger. I was in Ketchum once and someone pointed it out to me. Hadn't even read Hemingway yet so it made no difference. Nope, pushed it with his big toe - - Now, if you REALLY want to know what killed Hemingway - I'll try to explain it to you...very sympathetically for several reasons. For one, he is one of my \"heroes.\" Secondly, my father, who was much like him, also shot himself - - Now, if ya don't want to get bored, switch to another thread, or just make a \"reply\" in another direction and ignore the following>>> Hemingway wrote in a style know as \"Existentialism,\" which was somewhat of a reaction to, but not a refutation of \"Mechanistic Determinism\" more exemplified by writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his Great Gatsby. Both were spin-offs of \"Realism/Naturalism\" made famous by the likes of Jack London and his Call of the Wild/White Fang books. Now, how does this all fit together and cause Hemingway's death? \"Realism/Naturalism\", driven by the coldness brought into the world by Darwin's concepts of Natural Selection/Survival of the Fittest rejected the kindhearted, sugary view of nature and the world painted by the Romantics and instead embraced the harsh, \"claws out and fangs ready\" picture of both nature and man, trying to show all aspects of human existence in the coldest, hardest, meanest, disinterested perspectives available. Witness the harsh treatment of both men and beasts in Jack London's book, but in order to be very true, the author had to experience every aspect of his story before writing it. Not too surprisingly that many of these early Realist authors started out as on-the-spot newspaper reporters like Stephen Crane ( Red Badge of Courage). These realists also REJECTED the idea that there was a \"caring God\" who tried to help people or even cared about them at all. People survived by their wits or died because of their stupidity (London's To Build a Fire, but it all means nothing. Out of this \"meaninglessness\" comes \"Mechanistic Determinism\" - the idea that there are gigantic unseen, uncaring forces controlling the lives of mankind: Gravity, meteor strikes, earthquakes, wars, giant corporations of banks, oil, railroads, giant governments, giant businesses, stock markets, storms, climate changes - all scientifically predictable, but none of which can the individual comprehend, much less control - which control him, push him, beat him down, destroy him - possibly watching with large, cold, uncaring eyes ! (Witness the large, cold, spectacled, always-watching eyes on the Billboard in \"Great Gatsby.\") Mechanistic Determinism says that the individual, no matter what he does, will always be battered, pounded down, destroyed by these forces, no matter what he does or thinks, without remorse. Thus, it creates a kind of predictable \"fate\" but never a triumphant one - always failure, always tragic, always grey and dark, and the Great Depression seemed to confirm it so Terribly (Witness John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, etc.) Hemingway rejected some of this, but not all. He was certainly steeped in Mechanistic Determinism, but he did not totally reject the old Romantic idea of the Noble Hero. Thus, he went into \"Existentialism\" which accepted the concept of Mechanistic Determinism that the Individual is up against giant forces he will never understand, or comprehend, or defeat - and he will eventually be crushed and destroyed - but the thing that gives a human his greatness, his dignity, his honor, and his nobility is HOW He determines to exist that he never has to give up fighting! He can say \"Fxvxvk This!\" and fight all the forces, kicking and screaming, to the bitter end... Thus \"Existentialism\"!! And if you think about all of Hemingway's characters of any worth, that's what they do - they fight, get crushed, fight more, get crushed more - and are finally destroyed...never quite knowing what they had fought, and what had destroyed them...but they never quit - to that last \"spit-in-the-eye\" moment, before fading into what seems a meaningless end of nothingness and death. Witness The Old Man and the Sea - the old fisherman dreaming of lions free on a distant beach as he dies on his filthy bunk, while the skeleton of his giant shark eaten fish washing on the beach - a symbol of lost battles and futility, but also his un-witnessed refusal to quit, and his grizzled nobility... And Hemingway seemed to live that life, tasting it, being it, fighting, scrambling, winning, losing, accumulating, wasting - but always on the very edge of the spear, the razor's edge of LIFE! - - Then he killed himself, and everyone yelled \"Traitor!\" because they felt he had given up, that he was a phony, that he hadn't fought to the end. And I was one who thought that - until my father shot himself. Until I studied Hemingway's battle with cancer - until I traveled to, and stayed at Ketchum, Idaho to think about it - - And then, I understood. Cancer is just one more of those incomprehensible giant monsters that rip down, tear away, butcher and maim, so is Depression, and Alzheimers, and Palsy, and all the other maladies that can grip a man in his old age and beat him down, and crush him piece buy piece and destroy him like an uncaring scientist looking at a bug through magnifying glasses while cutting it coldly to pieces...

        "content": "Hi everyone, I was reading your post and realised that I really did not know much about the back ground of Ernest Hemingway other than he was a writer, so I looked him up and this was the bio I found and thought I would share with you what they said... Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), born in Oak Park, Illinois, started his career as a writer in a newspaper office in Kansas City at the age of seventeen. After the United States entered the First World War, he joined a volunteer ambulance unit in the Italian army. Serving at the front, he was wounded, was decorated by the Italian Government, and spent considerable time in hospitals. After his return to the United States, he became a reporter for Canadian and American newspapers and was soon sent back to Europe to cover such events as the Greek Revolution. During the twenties, Hemingway became a member of the group of expatriate Americans in Paris, which he described in his first important work, The Sun Also Rises (1926). Equally successful was A Farewell to Arms (1929), the study of an American ambulance officer's disillusionment in the war and his role as a deserter. Hemingway used his experiences as a reporter during the civil war in Spain as the background for his most ambitious novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Among his later works, the most outstanding is the short novel, The Old Man and the Sea (1952), the story of an old fisherman's journey, his long and lonely struggle with a fish and the sea, and his victory in defeat. Hemingway - himself a great sportsman - liked to portray soldiers, hunters, bullfighters - tough, at times primitive people whose courage and honesty are set against the brutal ways of modern society, and who in this confrontation lose hope and faith. His straightforward prose, his spare dialogue, and his predilection for understatement are particularly effective in his short stories, some of which are collected in Men Without Women (1927) and The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories (1938). Hemingway died in Idaho in 1961. ..........just wondering if you think the fact he wrote about his subjects losing faith all the time makes you think he once believed in God himself? But do you really believe in God if you doubt him when something bad happens? How would you define faith? Is it unconditional love? Is it never to question why? Is it fear of the unknown? I have often wondered why bad things happen, have you?",
