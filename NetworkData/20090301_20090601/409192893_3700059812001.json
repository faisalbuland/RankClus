I'm hardly financially sophisticated enough to give more than a layman's opinion. I just thought it makes as much sense as all the other finger pointing of who's to blame. Take a look and at the video and ask yourself if what is presented seems valid. I for one feel that the lack of oversight has allowed this to happen and we have to see that it doesn't continue and should never be allowed to again. If you agree pass the link on. >>>>http://antisocialmedia.net/?p=165 It's about 24 minutes long so anyone with a short attention span isn't going to get much out of it.",
