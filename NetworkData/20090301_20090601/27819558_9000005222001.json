        "content": "The View From Britain Here in the U.K., almost 10 years on, it\u2019s difficult to imagine what the fuss was all about. The United Kingdom approach to \u201cgays in the military\u201d was not developed through altruism or enabled by a broad acceptance in the military that they needed to reflect the society which they served. This was a policy born out of protest from senior officers and implemented through absolute necessity after exhausting the options of every court in the U.K. and Europe. Right now it\u2019s difficult to imagine what the fuss was all about. Almost 10 years on, a new generation of senior officers are responsible for the quiet success of a policy that honors the covenant between politicians, military commanders and the men and women who may face the ultimate sacrifice for their country. All servicemen and women should have an expectation that the military and the government will care for them and their families come what may. In facing the challenges of integration, it is not enough to simply allow gay men and women to serve without the fear of dismissal. If the U.S. decides to lift the ban on gays in the military, it must extend its provision of welfare services to the families (partners) of gay personnel, develop a supportive gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender community and put in place education and support initiatives that will ensure they are welcomed and valued as members of the military. This will need unswerving and substantial top-level leadership. For some individuals this will mean sweeping aside personally held moral judgements. For a very few, this may mean a foreshortened career to uphold a moral position. Senior officers in the U.K. would tell you that they faced a thousand greater challenges in their military careers than the challenge of integrating gay men and women. >>>http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/in-the-barracks-out-of-the-closet/",
