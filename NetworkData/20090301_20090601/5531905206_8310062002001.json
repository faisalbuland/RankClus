What you need to check are things such as: * % serving in ground combat units (GCUs)in VN vs % in population * % serving in GCUs vs % of other groups from the same economic strata serving in GCUs * % of total serving in the military that were in GCUs vs % of other groups in the military serving in GCUs. For example (not real) if 80% of one group served in GCUs but only 20% of another group then there would be reason to \"check\" on why the first group was over represented in GCUs. On the other hand it the % in GCUs is close for all groups then that is a clear indicator that there was probably no group bias in the assignments. Some other issues to look at are education levels and opportunity in home areas (for example Appalachia). Let's tell it like it is. Americans are standing up and fighting for this great nation.

Some of us fought wars and were spit upon. Such a thread seems to continue that sort of thing by creating classes with in the military and needlessly ****ing people off by insidious insinuations.",
