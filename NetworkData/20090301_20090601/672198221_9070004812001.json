The military said in a statement that the incident occurred around 1:00 a.m. local time on Friday (5 p.m. EDT, Thursday), when the USS Hartford, a submarine, and the USS New Orleans, an amphibious ship, collided. According to the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, 15 sailors aboard the Hartford were slightly injured but able to return to duty. No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans. Both ships were heading to port when the incident occurred in the narrow strait, said Lt. Nate Christensen. He said the incident occurred at night, and the submarine was submerged at the time, but said he could give no further details as the incident is still under investigation. Both vessels are now heading to port for repairs and evaluation, but Christensen said that following standard security procedures he could not say where the vessels were heading. The New Orleans suffered a ruptured fuel tank, resulting in an oil spill of approximately 25,000 gallons (95,000 liters) of diesel fuel. There was no damage the nuclear reactor powering the Hartford, Christensen said. Both ships are currently operating under their own power. The Navy said both ships were on regularly scheduled deployments to the region and conducting security operations.
