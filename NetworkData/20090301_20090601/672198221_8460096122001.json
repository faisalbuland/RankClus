(...) Laser Phalanx: Obstacles and Issues According to Peppe, a Laser Phalanx solution would offer an effective range about 3 times that of the existing M61A1 20mm gun, along with lower life-cycle costs. A laser-based Phalanx system certainly sounds interesting. Nevertheless, there are a number of hurdles to cross and tests to pass before it can be considered a true advance over the current set of slug-throwing \u201clast chance\u201d systems out there. The first obstacle is the requirement for more powerful solid-state lasers, which can fit into a similar \u201cfootprint\u201d as existing Phalanx weapons, and are rugged enough to survive the abuse dished out by salt spray, sand, and other inherent hazards of military existence. Most mortar rounds are larger than the 60mm bombs used in the tests, as are the rockets that featured so prominently in the 2006 Lebanon proxy war. The second obstacle is the environment, which does more than just dish out maintenance-related abuse. Naval deployment would be affected by atmospheric humidity and fog, for instance, or by rain. They weaken lasers, but have very little effect on radar-guided cannon. The third obstacle is uniquely naval: the growing reality of supersonic ship-killer missiles. Their speed, and ability to perform evasive maneuvers on final approach, gives them added advantages against any weapon that must be held on target for a period of time in order to work. Worse, even pieces of supersonic missile pieces have enough kinetic energy to cause a lot of damage to a ship, unless the incoming object is slowed or deflected by an opposing kinetic force. A naval defense laser, therefore, would require enough power to burn through enemy missiles almost immediately. It would also have to work in such a way that large supersonic missiles either fragment into relatively small pieces when hit, or can be killed far enough away thanks to timely engagement, extra range, and sufficient burn power at range. Even in adverse weather conditions. A 4th obstacle applies more strongly to land-based lasers. A 20mm cannon shell has a finite range, and can be designed to detonate after a prescribed distance for safety. This protects people on the ground under the shell\u2019s flight path, and also provides a margin of safety to aircraft flying near protected bases. A laser doesn\u2019t have that option, and the same power requirement that ensures fast-enough kills on incoming rockets, also gives a laser more effective range. Maintaining the safety of friendly forces and civilian air traffic in areas protected by laser weapons will be a challenge. Laser Phalanx: Updates and DevelopmentsJan 30/09: White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico state continues to test a solid-state laser version of the Phalanx weapons system. The laser has proven capable of \u201crapidly\u201d penetrating armor plating even when not at full power, and the next step is to test the system on mortar rounds. The exact time required for burn-through or detonation of incoming rounds is a very important number. The longer an exact focus must be maintained on a rocket or mortar round, the less effective the system will be. US Army release.(...) This message has been edited.
