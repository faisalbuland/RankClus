I plan on breaking my lease with my apartment complex at the end of april, thus getting out of may, june and july of rent. I live in florida and there is a statute specifically about this. I have 2 questions. 1. Has anyone had any problems doing this in the past? My apartment complex is not very friendy in the first place as its a college complex and they just well...arent super friendly. Also I am pretty sure they havent had to deal with this before (the complex is only 3 years old. But I figure if i go in there and act like a gentlemen I shoudnt have too much of a problem. 2.The florida statute isnt very clear about how early I can break my lease from when my orders start. I go on active duty june 7th but im trying to break the last day of april so thats like a month earlier. My commander says that as long as I have orders I essentially can break my lease whenever. What do you all say? Thanks",

I did it this way; I ended up paying for 1 month's extra rent (until they found new renters), but they also mailed me a nice referral letter afterwards.
