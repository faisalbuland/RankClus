Why do you insist on parading things around as if they are fact when in actuality you have zero evidence to support it? \"The ONLY evidence contrary to the birther's case is a Hawaiian Certificate of Live Birth which is from 1981(supposedly).\" Since you seem to be unaware of he fact that in the USA it is up to the accuser to prove their case. Not the other way around. So far none of you birthers have shown that he was born anyplace other than the US. But you don't seem to let that get in the way when you repeat lie after lie. \"His sister says he was born in a different hospital than what Barack says.\" So what? His younger half sister got the hospital wrong and its supposed to mean something? Tell me, do you know what hospital any of your siblings were born in? I have an older half sister and I have no idea what hospital she was born in. And if I were to say what hospital she was born in and got it wrong does that eman she was not born in the USA? \"His underage mother had been living in Kenya married to Barack's polygamous Kenyan/Arab\" She was not underage and would you please show evidence that she ever lived in Kenya.

Two books written prior to the election address this: The Obama Nation by Jerome R Corsi ISBN-13: 9781416598060 Pub. Date: August 2008 and The Case Against Barack Obama: The Unlikely Rise and Unexamined Agenda of the Media's Favorite Candidate by David Freddoso ISBN-13: 9781596985667 Pub. Date: August 2008 both discuss this. I make no claims, the authors of these two best selling books do. While the facts presented are in question, I'd like to point out that there hasn't been a libel suit filed against either author by the President. So either the facts presented are true or he doesn't believe that defamation of his character has occurred by their printing. When you stated: quote: ...And his father was Kenyan, not Kenyan/Arab.

Why don't you look up some of the other things he has said. Like his views on 9-11. Interesting read. If you don't care about race then why are you bringing up the ethnicity of his father? We all know he was not an American citizen so why even talk about whether he has Kenyan or Kenyan/Arab?",

IMO you have a serious problem is fact that he's President is causing you physical harm and rasing your blood pressure. How can you have \"severe hatred\" for a person you have never meet? You can disagree with his policies but hating him? You're no different than the people who hated GWB so much that they were willing to believe anything about him.",

Says more about you than it does him. So now travel to Pakistan was \"restricted\". According to people like you I thought it was illegal?

But you don't seem to let that get in the way when you repeat lie after lie. \"His sister says he was born in a different hospital than what Barack says.\" So what? His younger half sister got the hospital wrong and its supposed to mean something? Tell me, do you know what hospital any of your siblings were born in? I have an older half sister and I have no idea what hospital she was born in.

Maybe even four years. Thank you all again it feels good to know I am not alone on this.",

Of course, John Wilkes Booth didn't think Abraham Lincoln was \"legally prez\" either. History proved him wrong (except to die-hard anti-American nutcases). I suspect history (after President Obama has completed his secord term as elected president of the United States) will prove you wrong as well. If you're ever in Washington, D.C., let us know - we'll warn President Obama and his wife not to go to any plays at Ford's Theater while you're there.",

IMO you have a serious problem is fact that he's President is causing you physical harm and rasing your blood pressure. How can you have \"severe hatred\" for a person you have never meet? You can disagree with his policies but hating him? You're no different than the people who hated GWB so much that they were willing to believe anything about him.",

Since you have a \"severe hatred\" for the man I doubt that anything he says or does is going to make a difference. I still wonder how you can have a severe hatred for someone you don't even know. Says more about you than it does him. So now travel to Pakistan was \"restricted\". According to people like you I thought it was illegal? Although people who said it was never showed any proff that it was. In relaity it makes no sense. Pakistan was an ally at the time. And what crimes are you talking about?",
