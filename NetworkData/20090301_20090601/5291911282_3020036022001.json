I have decided that I will enlist, and have narrowed my choices to the Air Force and Marine Corp. I've researched both over the last few weeks but I I just can't decide. I hear that the AF is the easiest of all branches and that they provide more technical training. I also found that Airmen have more time available to them outside their assigned duties. As my AF recruiter put it, \"You are able to 'live life' when not on duty. I like the Marine Corp because I know it would be the greatest challenge, and if I can become a Marine, I should be able to anything. Also, there is something about the Dress Blues that makes it all seem worth it. But I also hear that Marines are married to the Corp, leaving little time for outside life. I would like to go to school, but it's not my biggest concern, and I'm not scared of being deployed. My biggest fear is picking one and wishing I chose the other. I need some more points of view before I can make this decision. Thanks again for you input. Thx -a future Airman or Marine",

That is what should be governing your choices, not what someone else thinks or sees as best, especially at 23. You're old enough to make a choice and live with it. If you want to be tough and do tough, hard dirty, mean work the right way, then you should look and Army Infantry/Airborne/Special Forces, Navy Seals, or Marines. They all do that, and they do it right. If you want Combat Arms, but don't want to walk everywhere, then you should look at Army Armor/Artillery, or the same thing in Marines. If you want to see all parts of the world in one enlistment, the Navy can do that. If you want a lot of technical training, be around jets, work on 'em that stuff - now you're pretty much headed for Air Force and Navy.... The point is - What appeals the most to you??? When I was young, I wanted rough and tumble combat arms, but had a slightly game knee, so I enlisted Armor, and did some Combat Engineers towards the end. When I got older, and very tired of mud, I switched to Air Force and Radar - got great technical training and had a lot of good times, but slept a whole lot less on the ground or in tents - - You got to go for what YOU WANT! Otherwise, you'll never be satisfied, and probably end up hating it - - Wandering and Wondering",

Many new posters come in here as ask this question. It is very difficult for us to give you an unbiased answer but also difficult because only you really know what your interests are. Ex: go Infantry just because a bunch of us say it's a great job may not be a good fit for you. One bit of advice I saw was great....you may want to think about an MOS based on how it would translate to a job post military....or maybe you just need to do what you want most and let the post military thing play out later. I wouldn't get too caught up in the \"Dress Blues\" though I agree that they are, in my opinion, the best uniform we have in the different branches. My son has been an Active Duty Marine for three years now and has worn his on very rare occasions. Another thing, \"deployment\", he has yet to be deployed anywhere though he says he has asked to. He's a Corporal, Mechanic/Crew on the Amphibious Assault Vehicles. I don't think I've ever heard my son complain about lack of social life, then again, you're probably going to get a different opinion from any Marine in Iraq or Afghanistan. I grew up next to a USAF SAC Base in NH and have alway had a great respect for them. That brings up another subject. You may want to be stationed somewhere up North and though there may be USMC bases in the North, I can not think of any off the top of my head. I believe in the USAF you could be assigned to Alaska if that is something you are interested in....not me, I prefer warmth! Like I said, I grew up next to a USAF base, my son is a US Marine, but....both my brother and I went US Coast Guard because we both knew we wanted to be Coxswains and run the SAR boats. Best of luck in your difficult decision and hopefully your future in the Military if that is what you end up doing. Don",

Thx -a future Airman or Marine 1st of all, it's Corps, not Corp. 2nd of all, this is a big decision to be asking what other people think... you have to remember that this is YOUR decision and it's going to affect YOUR life. As a Marine Corps Daughter and Army Wife, I would say to not commit to either one, take your ASVAB and see what each branch will offer you. (yes you can do that, processing is basically the same for all branches) (PS, be sure to not sign the dotted line before you decide whole-heartedly, cuz once it's signed, that's it bub) If you want rough and tumble, down and dirty, non-stop, go go go, takin' names and kickin' @$$- go Marines or Army If you want to advance your career, get exceptional technical training and have the option of doing some really cool jobs- go Airforce No one can make that decision for you, you have to do the research yourself and do what you feel is right. There is an enormous amount of pride no matter what branch you choose (but Grunts have ALOT more fun! ) So there's just one question left newbie... are you a Jarhead or a Chair Jockey ( I kid I kid )",

That is what should be governing your choices, not what someone else thinks or sees as best, especially at 23. You're old enough to make a choice and live with it. If you want to be tough and do tough, hard dirty, mean work the right way, then you should look and Army Infantry/Airborne/Special Forces, Navy Seals, or Marines. They all do that, and they do it right. If you want Combat Arms, but don't want to walk everywhere, then you should look at Army Armor/Artillery, or the same thing in Marines. If you want to see all parts of the world in one enlistment, the Navy can do that. If you want a lot of technical training, be around jets, work on 'em that stuff - now you're pretty much headed for Air Force and Navy.... The point is - What appeals the most to you??? When I was young, I wanted rough and tumble combat arms, but had a slightly game knee, so I enlisted Armor, and did some Combat Engineers towards the end. When I got older, and very tired of mud, I switched to Air Force and Radar - got great technical training and had a lot of good times, but slept a whole lot less on the ground or in tents - - You got to go for what YOU WANT!

Im leaving college to enlist because school's not for me; Im a slacker(part of the reason Im enlisting is to get some discipline) I guess all I really want is to get away from Southwest, GA(the ass-end of the backwoods) and better myself, but I also want be close to home, as I have 9 nieces and nephews who need that \"older person\" that they dont have at home. I'll keep researching.... thx again you guys! This message has been edited. Last edited by: thekingof118, Mon 13 April 2009 05:25 PM",

Many new posters come in here as ask this question. It is very difficult for us to give you an unbiased answer but also difficult because only you really know what your interests are. Ex: go Infantry just because a bunch of us say it's a great job may not be a good fit for you. One bit of advice I saw was great....you may want to think about an MOS based on how it would translate to a job post military....or maybe you just need to do what you want most and let the post military thing play out later. I wouldn't get too caught up in the \"Dress Blues\" though I agree that they are, in my opinion, the best uniform we have in the different branches. My son has been an Active Duty Marine for three years now and has worn his on very rare occasions. Another thing, \"deployment\", he has yet to be deployed anywhere though he says he has asked to. He's a Corporal, Mechanic/Crew on the Amphibious Assault Vehicles. I don't think I've ever heard my son complain about lack of social life, then again, you're probably going to get a different opinion from any Marine in Iraq or Afghanistan. I grew up next to a USAF SAC Base in NH and have alway had a great respect for them. That brings up another subject. You may want to be stationed somewhere up North and though there may be USMC bases in the North, I can not think of any off the top of my head. I believe in the USAF you could be assigned to Alaska if that is something you are interested in....not me, I prefer warmth! Like I said, I grew up next to a USAF base, my son is a US Marine, but....both my brother and I went US Coast Guard because we both knew we wanted to be Coxswains and run the SAR boats. Best of luck in your difficult decision and hopefully your future in the Military if that is what you end up doing. Don",

(yes you can do that, processing is basically the same for all branches) (PS, be sure to not sign the dotted line before you decide whole-heartedly, cuz once it's signed, that's it bub) If you want rough and tumble, down and dirty, non-stop, go go go, takin' names and kickin' @$$- go Marines or Army If you want to advance your career, get exceptional technical training and have the option of doing some really cool jobs- go Airforce No one can make that decision for you, you have to do the research yourself and do what you feel is right. There is an enormous amount of pride no matter what branch you choose (but Grunts have ALOT more fun! ) So there's just one question left newbie... are you a Jarhead or a Chair Jockey ( I kid I kid )",
