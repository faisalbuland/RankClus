You know, a bit of a \"Chicken Soup for the UAV enthusiast's soul\". I'm putting together a presentation for University students that are already engaged in the UAV community. I'd like to give them a glimpse of how their efforts are affecting the world and the people in it. I want to go beyond the newspaper headlines and marketing and tell the real stories. Real situations, real people (names can be changed for confidentially, of course). My day job is writing software for UAVs (Warrior, Shadow 200, Hunter, Aerosonde) but this is pretty far removed from anyone that actually uses UAVs. Beyond my presentation for these students, I'm really interested to see how my own efforts are affecting people in the world. If anyone can help me out by providing stories or sending me links (to posted stories or other forums), I am truly grateful. Thanks in advance, Mike",

        "content": "I was a yung troop when the first UAV test models were being put together. It was quite exciting in the first days of the program and I was given the task of winding up the \"motor\" which at that time was a very large rubber band which when twisted to a very tight strand would store enough energy to cause the propeller to spin wildly and force air past the wings of this new weapon. The trick was holding the propeller until the launch order was given and then let go and run like he11. We didn't have any weapons for this plane yet so we had to rely on some latex rubber test pods which we filled with a mixture of two parts Hydrogen and one part oxygen. They proved to be efficient items for this test project. In the latter years we started using match heads stuffed inside a metal tube with a nozzle at one end. When ignited they would force the plane forward until it took off or exploded. Lighting that sucker was my job as all the other peons had been either badly burned or had lost fingers holding the propeller for the first generation UAV's. Hey I hope this helps you with your... What did you say you were doing? Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
