Dave Strictly speaking, it's not a call to eliminate the Bill of Rights, it's more like a call to say the U.S. Constitution establishes limits upon the Federal government's authority. One can certainly argue that at some point, federal authority should have limits. So, the Bill of Rights could essentially be clarified as: 1. The federal government may not limit freedom of speech and the press, to gather, seek redress of greivances, nor will the federal government establish religeon. 2. A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the federal government will not infringe the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Et cetera. So, not \"the states can override the federal constitution\", but more like \"the federal constitution doesn't apply to the states\". This is more widespread than just Sotomayor. Look at the credit card bill just passed, that basically says state gun laws now apply on federal parks located within that state. The federal ban on guns within federal parks was removed. Power taken from the federal government and restored to the state. What does this mean? Yes, you could argue that this will lead down the road of the states restricting rights, but we're already there. Any time nationwide concealed carry comes up, the answer is \"it's a matter for the states\". So, the people in each state need to decide what rights they want protected in their state constitutions. Why do so many states specify \"the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\" in some form or fashion in their state constitutions, if not to place limits on what gun laws their state government can pass? Same should apply with other rights. There is no reason the people in each state shouldn't be able to decide what individual rights they want their state and local governments to be able to restrict. The federal government should have a VERY narrow base of \"these rights are inviolate to all Americans\".",

One can certainly argue that at some point, federal authority should have limits. So, the Bill of Rights could essentially be clarified as: 1. The federal government may not limit freedom of speech and the press, to gather, seek redress of greivances, nor will the federal government establish religeon. 2.

All claims to the contrary, State Rights do NOT overide the rights of citizenship in our country. Seeking to reclaim the power to limit our rights, doesn't seem to have much to do with OUR Rights. Might as well just call \"Freedom, Slavery\" and be done with it. Dave States are allowed to limit/restrict the franchise of people for things such as felony convictions. Now, the part of the 14th that you imply places the US Constitution wide supremacy over State COnstitutions simply says \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Note it says \"priviledges or immunities\", NOT \"rights specified elsewhere in the COnstitution\". States may also not deprive one of \"life, liberty or property\" without \"due process\". Not, \"never under any circumstances\", not \"only within the confines of federal law\". And it specifies states must \"give everyone equal protection under the law\". It does NOT say \"state governments can pass no laws which are more restrictive than the federal government can pass\". It may take a Constitutional judge to determine the difference between a \"right\" a \"priviledge\" and an \"immunity\", but it IS clear that state and local governments can pass more restrictive laws regarding the RKBA than the federal government can.",

To oppose or support who is going to be the President. To be able to read the press, and find that certain questions have two sides to them. That even if one media outlet doesn't have both sides, that another will. That I can turn on the radio and hear BOTH Limbaugh and Rhodes. I would expect that I have the right to vote in local elections, based simply on my being a citizen This is the United States of America, and not The Conferated Republics of America. Should Federal Power be curtailed? yes, I would agree, but NOT at the expense of of my Rights. Before the passage of the 14th amendment, all of the above illustrations were in effect and deprived those people of their inherent rights as Americans.
