You can see how it changes the emphasis and therefor the thrust, of the sentence. To simplify, think of it as writing in the way people speak, not as one would when writing a technical treatise or some such. The tendency now a days is to write in short declarative sentences as the average reader is not as good at reading and retention as our generation is, so the style of narrative has changed considerably. Read some early Stephan King and some of what he has written lately. Some used to castigate Heinlien for his rambling sentences, with out realising that he was writing as people speak and THAT's what made it palatable for the average teenage reader like you and I were, when we started reading his stuff in H.S.!! CONSIDER the last paragraph. Some used to upbraid Heilein for his rambling sentences. They did not take into account an important point. He was writing as people speak. This made it more palatable for the readers of those times. We in our youth savored the written word as we learned to communicate. Today it is almost considered an impediment to take the time to read. Many see the tape or c.d. as the way to absorb information. Reading to you and I however is much more than simply absorbing information. When we read we are ACTIVE in our participation. Not merely spectators of the drama! That is how I would write if I was presenting it for a letter to an editor, or for publication. Short declarative sentences. I can write either way, but prefer to do as I do to personalise it for the fora and such as my blog. This message has been edited. Last edited by: tawodi, Thu 09 April 2009 06:29 AM",
