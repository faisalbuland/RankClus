What worries me more is the education mills that turn out graduates that can't read at a third grade level. It's not only public schools but charter schools too. Since they're profit based, they may be even more guilty. Your post deserves a more complete response..but I'm off to bed after working about 30000 hours this week. That said: I'm yet to see a problem with charter schools. You have a link? I'm sure you can find corroborating evidence on the net but I'm going by personal experience. Both grandsons attended a charter school and were receiving good grades. On Mother's day all the fellas decided to cook and clean house so the females could just relax. I discovered that Mikey couldn't read the directions off a cake box to me. I went to that school and raised hell wondering why he's getting A's and B's and can't read a cake box. When I talked to his counselor, she couldn't look me in the eye. I'm not saying public schools are any better but I think charter schools are way overrated.",

What's the definition of a third world country again? We are slipping and contrary to right wing indoctrination, it's mostly our fault. We no longer value education, in fact we seem to despise it. It's not Mexicans crossing the border that is our main threat. It's institutionalized ignorance. You're right. But you can look direclty at the policys of the left as to why. The entrie: we are all equal, movement..the culture of never saying anything is wrong, the inability to make a judgement call about anything.. Beyond that the fight against English only schools..when by every measure they are better..the fight for teacher unions, which have crippled our education system.. In my state, you must, BY LAW, teach every child in that childs native language. So, if you live in a city with dozens of differant nationalities, all of whom are illegal..then you need to have a teacher, for every subject, for every langauge for every student. Thats INSANE. The push to send every child to college..INSANE. The only way to do that is to LOWER standards. Right now, kids are going to colleges that have no business claming a high school degree. Yet, you and I, are going to pay to send children to school that cant meet the standards. Policies of the left? In this one, everybody is guilty. The right values legend over science and has branded higher education as a \"nest for leftist, intellectual traitors\". What city do you live in? I'll agree that such a policy is totally unmanageable. I think budget realities will solve that one. It's not a push to send every child to college, rather it's trying to make it so that every child can go to college that can meet the standards. So we don't have to lower standards, just give universal access to qualified students. I really don't mind paying a bit extra so that qualified students can get a leg up.
