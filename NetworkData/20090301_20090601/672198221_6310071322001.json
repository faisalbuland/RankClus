We lost a shuttle on take off. We lost a shuttle on landing. but we've have not lost one in orbit. I hope this never happens...losing a shuttle in orbit due to space debris. With the speeds we are talking, even a small piece could be catastrophic to the shuttle or a person in a suit. How exactly they track all this small debris or even how they would steer clear of it is beyond me. I was watching NOVA tonight about the shuttle accidents. Both of those causes, they knew there was a risk, but did nothing. I have been around jets and safety of flight issues for 20 years, I know the fine line between making a good call and a bad call. I just hope this time, they made a good one. Of course there is always risk, that's the nature of the beast, but it's being complacent, thinking you have control over something when in reality not eliminating the risk we know about is what gets us everytime. At the very least, I hope they inspect the shuttle before re-entry, even if no \"unusual event\" took place. I know this sounds crazy, but usually whenever we had jets crashing it seemed like they always came in 3. Or \"events\" happen in 3. Not all together all the time, but close together. At least it seems like it. I remember one cruise I was on we had 3 jets lost within 2 hours of each other. 2 collided, another had hydraulic failure. Lets hope I am dead wrong about the 3s. We can not take another failure in our space program.",

The U.S. Space Surveillance Network routinely follows more than 8,000 objects that are larger than four inches across, which is approximately the lower limit of detectability for current technologies. When the network determines that the shuttle will pass within about a mile of a piece of debris, the astronauts may decide to fire the shuttle's rockets to give the junk a wider berth. But Earth's orbit also contains perhaps 100,000 objects that measure from half an inch to four inches across -- objects too small to see on radar but large enough to cause a spacecraft to fail. They are the land mines of space, undetected until something crosses their path. \"http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98jul/junk.htm\"",
