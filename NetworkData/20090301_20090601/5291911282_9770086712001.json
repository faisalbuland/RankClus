That being the case, I feel the need to have a good discussion/debate. The subject, secession of states from the union, is it legal, when is is justifiable, and lastly, based on what evidence.

The President of the United States is the Chief of all Police - Military and Civil - of this Nation, and he has no choice but to enforce the Law, or be treasonous to his Oath, his Office, and the Constitution itself. That is the view Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer by training, took. The Constitution doesn't even give Congress the option to debate or vote for a State to secede. So, a state can declare for secession, but the President MUST consider that an act of Grand Larceny against Federal Property: The Miltiary Forts (Ft. Sumter), the Installations, munitions, equipment, roads, and even the very land of the state itself. And the state must recognize that the Commander in Chief, the Federal Government, and all its Military Forces must stop that theft, or be in violation of ALL Oaths and Offices. The state might try to negotiate just payment for all the Federal Property, loss of income (taxes) and other losses the Federal Government might suffer in good faith, attempting to avoid conflict and War. But there is NOTHING in the Constitution which would even allow Congress or the President to proceed into such negotiations... The only way that secession could be legal and not involve Civil War would be for a Constitutional Amendment to first be passed and ratified allowing secession without War. The steps would have to be civil and basically follow in reverse the application for statehood, with no prior hostilities.... Some states, prior to the Civil War, on the advice of Thomas Jefferson, a continual foe of the Constitution and the Federal Government, passed \"Nullification Acts\" against various Federal Laws, thus saying those Laws do not apply within the boundaries of the \"nullifying\" state. The Constitution, and all Laws passed under it, defines the Law of the Land, and cannot be nullified. Only the Supreme Court can determine a Law as \"unconstitutional, null, and void,\" or the People and Congress can vote out a Law. But no state can pick and chose or \"nullify\" a law. Thus, an \"Act of Nullification\" by a state is actually an illegal attempt to partially or wholly secede - an act of theft of Federal property and or treasure - a declaration of war, even if accidental... If you study closely the events leading to the Civil War, right from the Ratification of the Constitution 1789 (and all the problems brought in by not outlawing slavery then) right up until shots are fire at Ft Sumter in 1861, you will see all of the above being discussed, done, and causal to the deaths of some 650,000 souls - - Wandering and Wondering",

        "content": "This is what I Googled U.S. Constitution \"The Right To Secede\" March 4, 1789 The first union of the original 13 colonies was effected by the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781. The articles established a confederation of sovereign states in a permanent union. The \"permanence\" lasted only until 1788, when 11 states withdrew from the confederation and ratified the new Constitution, which became effective on March 4, 1789. The founding fathers recognized the defects in the Articles of Confederation, learned from these defects, and scrapped the articles in favor of the \"more perfect union\" found in the Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is there any mention of the union of the states being permanent. This was not an oversight by any means. Indeed, when New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia ratified the Constitution, they specifically stated that they reserved the right to resume the governmental powers granted to the United States. Their claim to the right of secession was understood and agreed to by the other ratifiers, including George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and was also a delegate from Virginia. In his book Life of Webster Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge writes, \"It is safe to say that there was not a man in the country, from Washington and Hamilton to Clinton and Mason, who did not regard the new system as an experiment from which each and every State had a right to peaceably withdraw.\" A textbook used at West Point before the Civil War, A View of the Constitution, written by Judge William Rawle, states, \"The secession of a State depends on the will of the people of such a State.\" Well into the 19th century, the United States was still viewed by many as an experimental confederation from which states could secede just as they had earlier acceded to it. It took a bloody war to prove them wrong. Fascinating Fact: It is significant that no Confederate leader was ever brought to trial for treason. A trial would have brought a verdict on the constitutional legality of secession. Federal prosecutors were satisfied with the verdict that had been decided in battle. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",

The \"permanence\" lasted only until 1788, when 11 states withdrew from the confederation and ratified the new Constitution, which became effective on March 4, 1789. The founding fathers recognized the defects in the Articles of Confederation, learned from these defects, and scrapped the articles in favor of the \"more perfect union\" found in the Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is there any mention of the union of the states being permanent. This was not an oversight by any means. Indeed, when New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia ratified the Constitution, they specifically stated that they reserved the right to resume the governmental powers granted to the United States. Their claim to the right of secession was understood and agreed to by the other ratifiers, including George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and was also a delegate from Virginia. In his book Life of Webster Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge writes, \"It is safe to say that there was not a man in the country, from Washington and Hamilton to Clinton and Mason, who did not regard the new system as an experiment from which each and every State had a right to peaceably withdraw.\" A textbook used at West Point before the Civil War, A View of the Constitution, written by Judge William Rawle, states, \"The secession of a State depends on the will of the people of such a State.\" Well into the 19th century, the United States was still viewed by many as an experimental confederation from which states could secede just as they had earlier acceded to it. It took a bloody war to prove them wrong. Fascinating Fact: It is significant that no Confederate leader was ever brought to trial for treason. A trial would have brought a verdict on the constitutional legality of secession. Federal prosecutors were satisfied with the verdict that had been decided in battle. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",

That is the view Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer by training, took. The Constitution doesn't even give Congress the option to debate or vote for a State to secede. So, a state can declare for secession, but the President MUST consider that an act of Grand Larceny against Federal Property: The Miltiary Forts (Ft.

But there is NOTHING in the Constitution which would even allow Congress or the President to proceed into such negotiations... The only way that secession could be legal and not involve Civil War would be for a Constitutional Amendment to first be passed and ratified allowing secession without War. The steps would have to be civil and basically follow in reverse the application for statehood, with no prior hostilities.... Some states, prior to the Civil War, on the advice of Thomas Jefferson, a continual foe of the Constitution and the Federal Government, passed \"Nullification Acts\" against various Federal Laws, thus saying those Laws do not apply within the boundaries of the \"nullifying\" state. The Constitution, and all Laws passed under it, defines the Law of the Land, and cannot be nullified. Only the Supreme Court can determine a Law as \"unconstitutional, null, and void,\" or the People and Congress can vote out a Law. But no state can pick and chose or \"nullify\" a law. Thus, an \"Act of Nullification\" by a state is actually an illegal attempt to partially or wholly secede - an act of theft of Federal property and or treasure - a declaration of war, even if accidental... If you study closely the events leading to the Civil War, right from the Ratification of the Constitution 1789 (and all the problems brought in by not outlawing slavery then) right up until shots are fire at Ft Sumter in 1861, you will see all of the above being discussed, done, and causal to the deaths of some 650,000 souls - - Wandering and Wondering",

Once taxation was defined under the Constitution, tariffs and excise taxes could be created, and when the backwoodsmen of Pennsylvania refused to pay the Whiskey Excise Tax, President Washington had every right and obligation under the Constitution to put down the rebellion by force and make people obey the tax - reference the 17000 troops sent to put down the whiskey rebellion. \"secession\" would have to be considered, defined, and ratified into the Constitution via amendment before it could become an action any state could take without defying the Constitution which creates the \"United\" States of America.

I suggest there is a right of secession, that right not being mentioned in the US Constitution, is held by the states and the people of the states. I have offered some citations that I feel support that belief. I do not intend to degrade this to the level of attacks on another member, and hope you have not interpeted any of my comments as such. Yes, should a second episode of civil war happen in the US I am certain it would be utterly disaterous, however, that is not the subject at hand. The matter at hand is this, the Constitution alludes to rights belonging to the people and states, it additionally imposes limits on the Federal government. What are the rights not listed that remain to the people and the states, and when can the Federal government go beyond the defined authority of the Constitution in matters pertaining to those un-mentioned rights of the people and states.",

That is the view Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer by training, took. The Constitution doesn't even give Congress the option to debate or vote for a State to secede. So, a state can declare for secession, but the President MUST consider that an act of Grand Larceny against Federal Property: The Miltiary Forts (Ft. Sumter), the Installations, munitions, equipment, roads, and even the very land of the state itself. And the state must recognize that the Commander in Chief, the Federal Government, and all its Military Forces must stop that theft, or be in violation of ALL Oaths and Offices. The state might try to negotiate just payment for all the Federal Property, loss of income (taxes) and other losses the Federal Government might suffer in good faith, attempting to avoid conflict and War. But there is NOTHING in the Constitution which would even allow Congress or the President to proceed into such negotiations... The only way that secession could be legal and not involve Civil War would be for a Constitutional Amendment to first be passed and ratified allowing secession without War. The steps would have to be civil and basically follow in reverse the application for statehood, with no prior hostilities.... Some states, prior to the Civil War, on the advice of Thomas Jefferson, a continual foe of the Constitution and the Federal Government, passed \"Nullification Acts\" against various Federal Laws, thus saying those Laws do not apply within the boundaries of the \"nullifying\" state. The Constitution, and all Laws passed under it, defines the Law of the Land, and cannot be nullified. Only the Supreme Court can determine a Law as \"unconstitutional, null, and void,\" or the People and Congress can vote out a Law. But no state can pick and chose or \"nullify\" a law. Thus, an \"Act of Nullification\" by a state is actually an illegal attempt to partially or wholly secede - an act of theft of Federal property and or treasure - a declaration of war, even if accidental... If you study closely the events leading to the Civil War, right from the Ratification of the Constitution 1789 (and all the problems brought in by not outlawing slavery then) right up until shots are fire at Ft Sumter in 1861, you will see all of the above being discussed, done, and causal to the deaths of some 650,000 souls - - Wandering and Wondering",

If you study closely the events leading to the Civil War, right from the Ratification of the Constitution 1789 (and all the problems brought in by not outlawing slavery then) right up until shots are fire at Ft Sumter in 1861, you will see all of the above being discussed, done, and causal to the deaths of some 650,000 souls - - Wandering and Wondering",

        "quote": "Originally posted by MM2_ss_Lewis: In regards to this, \"The \"colonies\" were never recognized as \"States\" by England, so they were never anything more to England than exploited territories, to be discarded once the resources had played out.\" The colonies were lands belonging to the British crown, correct? Thus, liberal90's claim that people have the right to emigrate, but not take land, would by his logic be unjust and illegal. What a king \"takes\" he must hold. George III didn't. Now, since on those lands then belonging to the British crown there existed properties of that nation, the colonist would, by your logic, be guilty of grand larceny against the British crown. The Red Coats and Hessians came to arrest them, but got arrested Your last post, I take umbrage with, as it seems to support tyranny by the Federal government should a state decide to leave the Union, yet the time which you refer to was when a group of people choose to leave a nation because of tyranny. You see, the real problem with secession is that it is not possible for it to be cut and dried, black and white, so to speak. Go ahead, declare independence and seced, if you think you have the force to survive. There will be a fight Now, is we assume that the Federal government is in fact limited to being a represenative of the several sovereign states, for purposes of order and negotiations with other nations, the issue becomes much simpler to deal with. As the lands within the border of the state properly belong to that state, and the people, the Federal government exist and is present at the leisure of the people. Should the people wish it, having invited the Federal government in, they have the concurrent right to un-invite the Federal government, should the people and the states feel that the Federal government has assumed a form harmful to their interest. The Contitution says \"We the People\" not \"We the States.\" It therefore a representative governement of humans, not dirt or boundaries - ...That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness... Thus, should a state or group of people determine that the government has become one contrary to their desires and is acting in a manner they deem destructive, the people have the right to cast it off. As for Mr. Lincoln, he flip floped on the matter of secession. Not when it came to killing people to save the union \"Any people, anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right, a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people, that can, may revolutionize, and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit. More than this, a majority of any portion of such people may revolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movements.\" ~ Lincoln January 12 1848 Then again, he threw out the whole \"freedom of the press\" bit as well... If you should choose to review his instructions to General Dix on 18 May 1864. Or maybe you have read this? \"But what am I to do in the meantime with those men at Montgomery? Am I to let them go on... and open Charleston, etc., as ports of entry, with their ten-percent tariff. What, then, would become of my tariff?\" ~ Lincoln to Colonel John B.

There's a time for it, but if your government is reasonably representative and not too repressive, you don't really have a leg to stand on as far as breaking off and forming a new nation. Your responsibility in that case it work within the system.",
