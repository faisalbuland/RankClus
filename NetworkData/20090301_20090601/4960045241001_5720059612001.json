He is therefore not an american and should not be our president .otherwise arnold schwartenager could be our president. I am wondering why, this never became an issue. I heard about it before, but didnt think about it. I wonder if that is what was counted on, the fact that no one would really care. I think now that it does matter. It is one of the stipulations for being a president of this country. If you are born here then you have a connection to here. I would like this investigated and checked out for sure ..so many of us can put it to rest. I voted conservative because I dont believe in abortion...that is my main issue. anyone who supports abortion in any degree doesnt get my vote..killing babies..no way...so...I voted my concious not my color. If barrack supported pro-life..he would have my vote...but he doesnt. Im very upset that Im finding out now that he is not an american and I want something done about it. I want him to PRODUCE A VAULT BIRTH CERTIFICATE..I ALSO URGE ANYONE WHO READ THIS TO DEMAND THE SAME THING..A LITMUS TEST...EVERY PRESIDENT SO FAR HAS DONE SO..WHY NOT BARRACK...THOSE OF YOU WHO VOTED FOR HIM BASED ON HIS POLICIES SHOULD WANT THAT ALSO..AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ARMED FORCES SHOULD REALLY DEMAND THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU ARE SERVING UNDER A COMMANDER AND CHIEF WHO REALLY SHOULDNT BE...HOW BAD IS THAT..IM GOING TO EMAIL MY CONGRESSMAN AND DEMAND THAT THIS HAPPEN...AND LIKE I SAID ANYONE READING THIS..DONT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR THIS ALSO..IS OUR PRESIDENT AN AMERICAN BORN CITIZEN..IF NOT..HE IS ILLEGAL...AND I WANT TO KNOW..THANK YOU..",

FactCheck.org's Summary 1. \"In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate...\" This statement is false -- the campaign released a \"Certification of Live Birth.\" The document is not now and never has been a birth certificate, and FactCheck.org knows it. So why did they publish this lie? 2. \"FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate.\" This statement is also a lie. The only people that have seen, touched, and examined Obama's birth certificate is Chiyome Leinaala Fuikino M.D., the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health. She wrote, \"There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s official birth certificate. State law (Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7338-18) prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.\" So your conclusion, \" We conclude that...\" is false, because your conclusions are based on a false statement, that you have seen Obama's birth certificate -- you haven't, because the State of Hawaii won't release it. What do you think is going on in the 48 lawsuits against Obama. These suits are all trying to get to Obama's birth certificate and 48 times, judges have said, \"I can't go for that, ohh, no, I can't go for that.\" 3. \"Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.\" Complete fabrication and bold-faced lie. What Fuikino wrote was, \" \"Therefore, I as Director of Health for the State of Hawai'i, along with the Registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" Nowhere in that statement does it say Obama was born in Honolulu, and here is the complete statement: -- check it out yourself. And, nowhere does FactCheck.org identify the militantly partisan website that released the \"Certification of Live Birth\" they received from the Obama Campaign -- The Daily Kos -- one of the wackiest websites extant. This FACT makes this entire scenario suspicious, if not patently ridiculous. FactCheck.org's Analysis 1. FactCheck.org's own analysis confirms what I wrote above, under Summary. 2. FactCheck.org presents a photo of a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" captioned, \"The Obama birth certificate, held by FactCheck writer Joe Miller.\" That's a lie, as well. The document in this photo is a \"Certification of Live Birth\" (getting tiresome, isn't it) -- not a birth certificate. They are different documents, and your mendacious organization knows the difference -- Joseph Goebbels would be proud of FactCheck.org's FactCheck.org presents a photo image of the document further down the page, under Analysis -- That document is not a \"birth certificate.\" It is a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" again, FactCheck.org knowingly misrepresents the document as something it is not, and it's not the document that was released. Here is the document that was released to The Daily Kos. The original document released had its Certificate Number blacked out -- and if one looks at the document, it says at the bottom, \"ANY ALTERATIONS INVALIDATE THIS CERTIFICATE\" -- even if the document were genuine -- it isn't VALID. 3. You publish several other images, defending your false allegations. If you want to see what a real analysis is, read Dr. Polarik's ........http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raZvphQSKJw 4. In late July, a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961. A birth announcement could have been easily phoned in to the newspaper from anywhere in the world. THis \"fact\" is inconclusive, unless you know who provided the newspaper with the announcement, the means they used, and where they wer physucally located at the time. FactCheck.org's Anal-ists FactCheck.org identifies their anal-ists as Jess Henig and Joe Miller. OK, that's fine, but who and what Jess Henig and Joe Miller? Are they qualified to make an analysis of ANY document, or are they just a couple of guys hanging around FactCheck.org's office, or are they political operators? What are their bona fides? FactCheck.org doesn't say. Wnder why? I prefer to give credence to Dr. Ron Polarik, who holds a Ph.D. in Instructional Media and specializes in computer graphics with over 20 years experience with computers, printers and typewriters, provides conclusive and irrefutable evidence that the Certificate of Live Birth (COLB) image created and distributed by Obama's campaign to the Daily Kos, Annenberg's Factcheck, and the St. Petersburg Times, and Politifact, is, unquestionably, a false identification document. Here, is his final report. A second expert forensic document examiner Sandra Ramsey Lines has filed an affidavit [.pdf] associated with one of the lawsuits stating the following: 1. I am Sandra Ramsey Lines, With an adddres at... I am a former federal examiner and law enforcement officer. I began training as a forensic document examiner in 1991. I am a Certified Diplomat of Forensic Sciences, a member of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, a member of the Southwestern Association of Forensic Document Examiners, and a member of the Questioned Document Subcommittee of the American Society of Testing and Materials. My background and credentials are set forth in Exhibit I attached hereto. 2. I have reviewed the attached affidavit [http://therightsideoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/anonymous_digitable_expert_declaration_signed.pdf] posted on the internet from \"Ron Polarik,\" who has declined to provide his name because of a number of death threats he has received. After my review and based on my years of experience, I can state with certainty that the COLB presented on the internet by the various groups, which include the \"Daily Kos,\" the Obama Campaign, \"Factcheck.org\" and others cannot be relied upon as genuine. FactCheck does say their, \"representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate, and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three-dimensional and resides at the Obama headquarters in Chicago,\" that clearly shows they are working with and for the Obama Campaign. My Comments SInce the title of this page is, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate,\" everything on the page is a bold-faced lie, because FactCheck.org has never, ever seen Obama's birth certificate. This is not surprising, since this website is funded by the same fine people who fund Obama's buddy, the unrepentent domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. They represent themselves as unbiased and non-partisan. That, of course, is just another lie. \"To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed...\" George Orwell, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" MOD HAT ON Hot links deleted.

After my review and based on my years of experience, I can state with certainty that the COLB presented on the internet by the various groups, which include the \"Daily Kos,\" the Obama Campaign, \"Factcheck.org\" and others cannot be relied upon as genuine. FactCheck does say their, \"representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate, and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three-dimensional and resides at the Obama headquarters in Chicago,\" that clearly shows they are working with and for the Obama Campaign. My Comments SInce the title of this page is, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate,\" everything on the page is a bold-faced lie, because FactCheck.org has never, ever seen Obama's birth certificate. This is not surprising, since this website is funded by the same fine people who fund Obama's buddy, the unrepentent domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. They represent themselves as unbiased and non-partisan. That, of course, is just another lie. \"To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed...\" George Orwell, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" MOD HAT ON Hot links deleted.

        "content": "-- I was recently engaged in an exchange of emails with my buddy from Oz that prompted me to revisit FactCheck.org, where the Annenberg-funded website has published a web page entitled, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate.\" The information on this page is 100% bovine excrement. FactCheck.org's Summary 1. \"In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate...\" This statement is false -- the campaign released a \"Certification of Live Birth.\" The document is not now and never has been a birth certificate, and FactCheck.org knows it. So why did they publish this lie? 2. \"FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate.\" This statement is also a lie. The only people that have seen, touched, and examined Obama's birth certificate is Chiyome Leinaala Fuikino M.D., the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health. She wrote, \"There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s official birth certificate. State law (Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7338-18) prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.\" So your conclusion, \" We conclude that...\" is false, because your conclusions are based on a false statement, that you have seen Obama's birth certificate -- you haven't, because the State of Hawaii won't release it. What do you think is going on in the 48 lawsuits against Obama. These suits are all trying to get to Obama's birth certificate and 48 times, judges have said, \"I can't go for that, ohh, no, I can't go for that.\" 3. \"Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.\" Complete fabrication and bold-faced lie. What Fuikino wrote was, \" \"Therefore, I as Director of Health for the State of Hawai'i, along with the Registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" Nowhere in that statement does it say Obama was born in Honolulu, and here is the complete statement: -- check it out yourself. And, nowhere does FactCheck.org identify the militantly partisan website that released the \"Certification of Live Birth\" they received from the Obama Campaign -- The Daily Kos -- one of the wackiest websites extant. This FACT makes this entire scenario suspicious, if not patently ridiculous. FactCheck.org's Analysis 1. FactCheck.org's own analysis confirms what I wrote above, under Summary. 2. FactCheck.org presents a photo of a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" captioned, \"The Obama birth certificate, held by FactCheck writer Joe Miller.\" That's a lie, as well. The document in this photo is a \"Certification of Live Birth\" (getting tiresome, isn't it) -- not a birth certificate. They are different documents, and your mendacious organization knows the difference -- Joseph Goebbels would be proud of FactCheck.org's FactCheck.org presents a photo image of the document further down the page, under Analysis -- That document is not a \"birth certificate.\" It is a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" again, FactCheck.org knowingly misrepresents the document as something it is not, and it's not the document that was released. Here is the document that was released to The Daily Kos. The original document released had its Certificate Number blacked out -- and if one looks at the document, it says at the bottom, \"ANY ALTERATIONS INVALIDATE THIS CERTIFICATE\" -- even if the document were genuine -- it isn't VALID. 3. You publish several other images, defending your false allegations. If you want to see what a real analysis is, read Dr. Polarik's ........http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raZvphQSKJw 4. In late July, a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961. A birth announcement could have been easily phoned in to the newspaper from anywhere in the world. THis \"fact\" is inconclusive, unless you know who provided the newspaper with the announcement, the means they used, and where they wer physucally located at the time. FactCheck.org's Anal-ists FactCheck.org identifies their anal-ists as Jess Henig and Joe Miller. OK, that's fine, but who and what Jess Henig and Joe Miller? Are they qualified to make an analysis of ANY document, or are they just a couple of guys hanging around FactCheck.org's office, or are they political operators? What are their bona fides? FactCheck.org doesn't say. Wnder why? I prefer to give credence to Dr. Ron Polarik, who holds a Ph.D. in Instructional Media and specializes in computer graphics with over 20 years experience with computers, printers and typewriters, provides conclusive and irrefutable evidence that the Certificate of Live Birth (COLB) image created and distributed by Obama's campaign to the Daily Kos, Annenberg's Factcheck, and the St. Petersburg Times, and Politifact, is, unquestionably, a false identification document. Here, is his final report. A second expert forensic document examiner Sandra Ramsey Lines has filed an affidavit [.pdf] associated with one of the lawsuits stating the following: 1. I am Sandra Ramsey Lines, With an adddres at... I am a former federal examiner and law enforcement officer. I began training as a forensic document examiner in 1991. I am a Certified Diplomat of Forensic Sciences, a member of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, a member of the Southwestern Association of Forensic Document Examiners, and a member of the Questioned Document Subcommittee of the American Society of Testing and Materials. My background and credentials are set forth in Exhibit I attached hereto. 2. I have reviewed the attached affidavit [http://therightsideoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/anonymous_digitable_expert_declaration_signed.pdf] posted on the internet from \"Ron Polarik,\" who has declined to provide his name because of a number of death threats he has received. After my review and based on my years of experience, I can state with certainty that the COLB presented on the internet by the various groups, which include the \"Daily Kos,\" the Obama Campaign, \"Factcheck.org\" and others cannot be relied upon as genuine. FactCheck does say their, \"representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate, and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three-dimensional and resides at the Obama headquarters in Chicago,\" that clearly shows they are working with and for the Obama Campaign. My Comments SInce the title of this page is, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate,\" everything on the page is a bold-faced lie, because FactCheck.org has never, ever seen Obama's birth certificate. This is not surprising, since this website is funded by the same fine people who fund Obama's buddy, the unrepentent domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. They represent themselves as unbiased and non-partisan. That, of course, is just another lie. \"To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed...\" George Orwell, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" MOD HAT ON Hot links deleted.

        "reply": "Lt Scott R Easterling is a brave and honorable Soldier. I do not understand the questioning of this Soldier's action in this matter?! He is qualified to serve his country and we know that because he thoroughly submitted to the process of qualification to serve in the Armed Forces of The United States of America. As a uniformed Officer, however, he must and should question the inept and total lack of process of qualification by this man elected to be his Commander-in-Chief. As a citizen of these United States, and as a mother whose Son served 4 deployments in this war on terror, I demand that you show this Officer the respect he is due and direct your attention to the dire matter at hand here. For the safety of these United States, this Officer is doing what I would hope the Armed Forces should do, require this elected Commander-in-Chief to qualify his position with the same rigor as all those who serve this great country. Lt Scott Eaterling is a qualifed Officer asking a question that directly affects the safety of every citizen in this land. It is a simple matter here and the elected Commander-in-Chief should promply provide his qualifications so that this fine Officer can get on with his duties. God Bless The United States Military and God Bless Lt. Scott Eaterling. Beverly Perlson",

        "content": "-- I was recently engaged in an exchange of emails with my buddy from Oz that prompted me to revisit FactCheck.org, where the Annenberg-funded website has published a web page entitled, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate.\" The information on this page is 100% bovine excrement. FactCheck.org's Summary 1. \"In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate...\" This statement is false -- the campaign released a \"Certification of Live Birth.\" The document is not now and never has been a birth certificate, and FactCheck.org knows it. So why did they publish this lie? 2. \"FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate.\" This statement is also a lie. The only people that have seen, touched, and examined Obama's birth certificate is Chiyome Leinaala Fuikino M.D., the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health. She wrote, \"There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s official birth certificate. State law (Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7338-18) prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.\" So your conclusion, \" We conclude that...\" is false, because your conclusions are based on a false statement, that you have seen Obama's birth certificate -- you haven't, because the State of Hawaii won't release it. What do you think is going on in the 48 lawsuits against Obama. These suits are all trying to get to Obama's birth certificate and 48 times, judges have said, \"I can't go for that, ohh, no, I can't go for that.\" 3. \"Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.\" Complete fabrication and bold-faced lie. What Fuikino wrote was, \" \"Therefore, I as Director of Health for the State of Hawai'i, along with the Registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" Nowhere in that statement does it say Obama was born in Honolulu, and here is the complete statement: -- check it out yourself. And, nowhere does FactCheck.org identify the militantly partisan website that released the \"Certification of Live Birth\" they received from the Obama Campaign -- The Daily Kos -- one of the wackiest websites extant. This FACT makes this entire scenario suspicious, if not patently ridiculous. FactCheck.org's Analysis 1. FactCheck.org's own analysis confirms what I wrote above, under Summary. 2. FactCheck.org presents a photo of a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" captioned, \"The Obama birth certificate, held by FactCheck writer Joe Miller.\" That's a lie, as well. The document in this photo is a \"Certification of Live Birth\" (getting tiresome, isn't it) -- not a birth certificate. They are different documents, and your mendacious organization knows the difference -- Joseph Goebbels would be proud of FactCheck.org's FactCheck.org presents a photo image of the document further down the page, under Analysis -- That document is not a \"birth certificate.\" It is a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" again, FactCheck.org knowingly misrepresents the document as something it is not, and it's not the document that was released. Here is the document that was released to The Daily Kos. The original document released had its Certificate Number blacked out -- and if one looks at the document, it says at the bottom, \"ANY ALTERATIONS INVALIDATE THIS CERTIFICATE\" -- even if the document were genuine -- it isn't VALID. 3. You publish several other images, defending your false allegations. If you want to see what a real analysis is, read Dr. Polarik's ........http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raZvphQSKJw 4. In late July, a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961. A birth announcement could have been easily phoned in to the newspaper from anywhere in the world. THis \"fact\" is inconclusive, unless you know who provided the newspaper with the announcement, the means they used, and where they wer physucally located at the time. FactCheck.org's Anal-ists FactCheck.org identifies their anal-ists as Jess Henig and Joe Miller. OK, that's fine, but who and what Jess Henig and Joe Miller?

        "reply": "-- I was recently engaged in an exchange of emails with my buddy from Oz that prompted me to revisit FactCheck.org, where the Annenberg-funded website has published a web page entitled, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate.\" The information on this page is 100% bovine excrement. FactCheck.org's Summary 1. \"In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate...\" This statement is false -- the campaign released a \"Certification of Live Birth.\" The document is not now and never has been a birth certificate, and FactCheck.org knows it. So why did they publish this lie? 2. \"FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate.\" This statement is also a lie. The only people that have seen, touched, and examined Obama's birth certificate is Chiyome Leinaala Fuikino M.D., the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health. She wrote, \"There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s official birth certificate. State law (Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7338-18) prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.\" So your conclusion, \" We conclude that...\" is false, because your conclusions are based on a false statement, that you have seen Obama's birth certificate -- you haven't, because the State of Hawaii won't release it. What do you think is going on in the 48 lawsuits against Obama. These suits are all trying to get to Obama's birth certificate and 48 times, judges have said, \"I can't go for that, ohh, no, I can't go for that.\" 3. \"Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.\" Complete fabrication and bold-faced lie. What Fuikino wrote was, \" \"Therefore, I as Director of Health for the State of Hawai'i, along with the Registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" Nowhere in that statement does it say Obama was born in Honolulu, and here is the complete statement: -- check it out yourself. And, nowhere does FactCheck.org identify the militantly partisan website that released the \"Certification of Live Birth\" they received from the Obama Campaign -- The Daily Kos -- one of the wackiest websites extant. This FACT makes this entire scenario suspicious, if not patently ridiculous. FactCheck.org's Analysis 1. FactCheck.org's own analysis confirms what I wrote above, under Summary. 2. FactCheck.org presents a photo of a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" captioned, \"The Obama birth certificate, held by FactCheck writer Joe Miller.\" That's a lie, as well. The document in this photo is a \"Certification of Live Birth\" (getting tiresome, isn't it) -- not a birth certificate. They are different documents, and your mendacious organization knows the difference -- Joseph Goebbels would be proud of FactCheck.org's FactCheck.org presents a photo image of the document further down the page, under Analysis -- That document is not a \"birth certificate.\" It is a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" again, FactCheck.org knowingly misrepresents the document as something it is not, and it's not the document that was released. Here is the document that was released to The Daily Kos. The original document released had its Certificate Number blacked out -- and if one looks at the document, it says at the bottom, \"ANY ALTERATIONS INVALIDATE THIS CERTIFICATE\" -- even if the document were genuine -- it isn't VALID. 3. You publish several other images, defending your false allegations. If you want to see what a real analysis is, read Dr. Polarik's ........http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raZvphQSKJw 4. In late July, a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961. A birth announcement could have been easily phoned in to the newspaper from anywhere in the world. THis \"fact\" is inconclusive, unless you know who provided the newspaper with the announcement, the means they used, and where they wer physucally located at the time. FactCheck.org's Anal-ists FactCheck.org identifies their anal-ists as Jess Henig and Joe Miller. OK, that's fine, but who and what Jess Henig and Joe Miller? Are they qualified to make an analysis of ANY document, or are they just a couple of guys hanging around FactCheck.org's office, or are they political operators? What are their bona fides? FactCheck.org doesn't say. Wnder why?

        "content": "-- I was recently engaged in an exchange of emails with my buddy from Oz that prompted me to revisit FactCheck.org, where the Annenberg-funded website has published a web page entitled, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate.\" The information on this page is 100% bovine excrement. FactCheck.org's Summary 1. \"In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate...\" This statement is false -- the campaign released a \"Certification of Live Birth.\" The document is not now and never has been a birth certificate, and FactCheck.org knows it. So why did they publish this lie? 2. \"FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate.\" This statement is also a lie. The only people that have seen, touched, and examined Obama's birth certificate is Chiyome Leinaala Fuikino M.D., the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health. She wrote, \"There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s official birth certificate. State law (Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7338-18) prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.\" So your conclusion, \" We conclude that...\" is false, because your conclusions are based on a false statement, that you have seen Obama's birth certificate -- you haven't, because the State of Hawaii won't release it. What do you think is going on in the 48 lawsuits against Obama. These suits are all trying to get to Obama's birth certificate and 48 times, judges have said, \"I can't go for that, ohh, no, I can't go for that.\" 3. \"Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.\" Complete fabrication and bold-faced lie. What Fuikino wrote was, \" \"Therefore, I as Director of Health for the State of Hawai'i, along with the Registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama\u2019s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\" Nowhere in that statement does it say Obama was born in Honolulu, and here is the complete statement: -- check it out yourself. And, nowhere does FactCheck.org identify the militantly partisan website that released the \"Certification of Live Birth\" they received from the Obama Campaign -- The Daily Kos -- one of the wackiest websites extant. This FACT makes this entire scenario suspicious, if not patently ridiculous. FactCheck.org's Analysis 1. FactCheck.org's own analysis confirms what I wrote above, under Summary. 2. FactCheck.org presents a photo of a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" captioned, \"The Obama birth certificate, held by FactCheck writer Joe Miller.\" That's a lie, as well. The document in this photo is a \"Certification of Live Birth\" (getting tiresome, isn't it) -- not a birth certificate. They are different documents, and your mendacious organization knows the difference -- Joseph Goebbels would be proud of FactCheck.org's FactCheck.org presents a photo image of the document further down the page, under Analysis -- That document is not a \"birth certificate.\" It is a \"Certification of Live Birth,\" again, FactCheck.org knowingly misrepresents the document as something it is not, and it's not the document that was released. Here is the document that was released to The Daily Kos. The original document released had its Certificate Number blacked out -- and if one looks at the document, it says at the bottom, \"ANY ALTERATIONS INVALIDATE THIS CERTIFICATE\" -- even if the document were genuine -- it isn't VALID. 3. You publish several other images, defending your false allegations. If you want to see what a real analysis is, read Dr. Polarik's ........http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raZvphQSKJw 4. In late July, a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961. A birth announcement could have been easily phoned in to the newspaper from anywhere in the world. THis \"fact\" is inconclusive, unless you know who provided the newspaper with the announcement, the means they used, and where they wer physucally located at the time. FactCheck.org's Anal-ists FactCheck.org identifies their anal-ists as Jess Henig and Joe Miller. OK, that's fine, but who and what Jess Henig and Joe Miller? Are they qualified to make an analysis of ANY document, or are they just a couple of guys hanging around FactCheck.org's office, or are they political operators? What are their bona fides? FactCheck.org doesn't say. Wnder why? I prefer to give credence to Dr. Ron Polarik, who holds a Ph.D. in Instructional Media and specializes in computer graphics with over 20 years experience with computers, printers and typewriters, provides conclusive and irrefutable evidence that the Certificate of Live Birth (COLB) image created and distributed by Obama's campaign to the Daily Kos, Annenberg's Factcheck, and the St. Petersburg Times, and Politifact, is, unquestionably, a false identification document. Here, is his final report. A second expert forensic document examiner Sandra Ramsey Lines has filed an affidavit [.pdf] associated with one of the lawsuits stating the following: 1. I am Sandra Ramsey Lines, With an adddres at... I am a former federal examiner and law enforcement officer. I began training as a forensic document examiner in 1991. I am a Certified Diplomat of Forensic Sciences, a member of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, a member of the Southwestern Association of Forensic Document Examiners, and a member of the Questioned Document Subcommittee of the American Society of Testing and Materials. My background and credentials are set forth in Exhibit I attached hereto. 2. I have reviewed the attached affidavit [http://therightsideoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/anonymous_digitable_expert_declaration_signed.pdf] posted on the internet from \"Ron Polarik,\" who has declined to provide his name because of a number of death threats he has received. After my review and based on my years of experience, I can state with certainty that the COLB presented on the internet by the various groups, which include the \"Daily Kos,\" the Obama Campaign, \"Factcheck.org\" and others cannot be relied upon as genuine. FactCheck does say their, \"representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate, and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three-dimensional and resides at the Obama headquarters in Chicago,\" that clearly shows they are working with and for the Obama Campaign. My Comments SInce the title of this page is, \"The truth about Obama's birth certificate,\" everything on the page is a bold-faced lie, because FactCheck.org has never, ever seen Obama's birth certificate. This is not surprising, since this website is funded by the same fine people who fund Obama's buddy, the unrepentent domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. They represent themselves as unbiased and non-partisan. That, of course, is just another lie. \"To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed...\" George Orwell, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" MOD HAT ON Hot links deleted.
