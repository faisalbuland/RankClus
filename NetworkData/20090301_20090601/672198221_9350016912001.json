Before you shoot off your mouth again about the Dems blocking his so called agenda... the Dems were emasculated during Bush's first term and only marginally effective even AFTER taking control of the House in 2006. Bush had what all President's dream of... A bully pulpit brought about because of 9/11. Without 9/11 Bush #43 might well have been a single term President because of the state of the Union... it was his wars that kept him in the spot light and the fear mongering that he and more specifically his party was not timid in exploiting. Not a damn thing has changed between November 2004 and November 2008. America is still as unsafe today as it was then... and THAT was his entire premise. We ARE where we financially are today because Bush had a bully pulpit. And because those in his administration placed their own personal and group agendas over what was best for the United States of America. They screwed the pooch... and for decades to come... America and Americans are going to be paying for it. And people like you are going to be snipping (and sniping) at the heals of anyone who tries to improve upon what has already been done. Good thing we won't have to wait until 2012 because Obama ain't going another term. Just to let you know April fool's was yesterday so your thoughts about the debt doesn't seem plausible since it is April 2. You have to realize one day as all Democrats will finally that it wasn't Bush that increased the debt, but 9/11 and 2 wars did. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

How much does it cost corporations in time and money to do the required survey work, studies, and legal work needed to collect and refine raw materials?

Incurring additional debt is a method to increase demand, however it must be temporary and must be used to encourage private sector growth, which in turn must increase wages to stabilize demand. Beginning with the Reagan administration, the emphases was placed on the \u201csupply-side\u201d of economics. Productivity increased while real wages stagnated. To compensate for the decreased demand, Allen Greenspan and the economic gurus at the time elected to open up credit. This allowed the public to maintain demand and provided additional profit to the financial sector. Companies were if not encouraged, certainly not discouraged from relocating overseas (again, additional profit). Unsecured credit became a problem so many of the guidelines placed on second mortgages were ignored in order to secure credit. Home loan guidelines were loosened in order to continue the pattern of encouraging debt to drive demand while securing the self-same debt. This is not a shot at the Republicans. Bill Clinton is as guilty of perpetuating this system as Ronald Reagan was of putting it into play. So, how do we solve the problem? 1. Borrow more money to invest in project that may stimulate increased production in the private sector? 2. Let it fall apart and start from scratch?

If the system fails\u2026have you ever heard of a capitalist revolution? How do you expect to dramaticly increase wages while simultaniously raising taxes on the people who pay those wages? Isn't a tax cut the same as a wage increase? What is the difference in a 10% wage increase or a 10% tax cut? If you dramaticly increase wages won't prices on consumer goods increase as well? Don't higher production costs mean higher prices? I agree that companies must be given incentives to stay in the US and create jobs here at home. The best way to do this is to lower corporate tax rates. You can blame Reagan, Clinton, and Bush all you want but the fact of the matter is that these companies move overseas for cheaper labor, lower taxes, and because technological advances over the last thirty years have allowed them to do so. CEO's all the way down to lower management could do their jobs from home with a cell phone and a lap top. With that kind of freedom available to everyone at a cheap price, we have to offer huge incentives to keep business here in the US. Notice I said incentives, not penalties. Corporations will always find ways around penalties while working to earn as many incentives as possible. Lower taxes. Give incentives for creating jobs. That is how you regrow the economy. Have you noticed how that hasn't worked yet? How many times does one have to do the same thing and expect a different outcome? There are two words that are usually reserved to describe such behavior... Those companies moved because there was no desire to lose money paying American workers a decent wage. More simply... It is the ultimate solution for supply side economics. And who in the USA is in favor of the supply side economics model?

Someday you are going to realize that the only fools out there... are the ones we see each time we look into a mirror. BTW: The debt at Bush's first day on the job was $5,806,151,389,190.21 So Mr. Bush personally Presided over a debt increase of $5,618,073,677,936.79... DOUBLE that of what he started out with. AND the repercussions of his AND his administrations STUPID mistakes will be adding at LEAST 1/2 TRILLION dollars to the debt each year for AT LEAST a decade more. Before you shoot off your mouth again about the Dems blocking his so called agenda... the Dems were emasculated during Bush's first term and only marginally effective even AFTER taking control of the House in 2006. Bush had what all President's dream of... A bully pulpit brought about because of 9/11. Without 9/11 Bush #43 might well have been a single term President because of the state of the Union... it was his wars that kept him in the spot light and the fear mongering that he and more specifically his party was not timid in exploiting. Not a damn thing has changed between November 2004 and November 2008. America is still as unsafe today as it was then... and THAT was his entire premise. We ARE where we financially are today because Bush had a bully pulpit. And because those in his administration placed their own personal and group agendas over what was best for the United States of America. They screwed the pooch... and for decades to come... America and Americans are going to be paying for it. And people like you are going to be snipping (and sniping) at the heals of anyone who tries to improve upon what has already been done.",

Without 9/11 Bush #43 might well have been a single term President because of the state of the Union... it was his wars that kept him in the spot light and the fear mongering that he and more specifically his party was not timid in exploiting.

Incurring additional debt is a method to increase demand, however it must be temporary and must be used to encourage private sector growth, which in turn must increase wages to stabilize demand. Beginning with the Reagan administration, the emphases was placed on the \u201csupply-side\u201d of economics. Productivity increased while real wages stagnated. To compensate for the decreased demand, Allen Greenspan and the economic gurus at the time elected to open up credit. This allowed the public to maintain demand and provided additional profit to the financial sector. Companies were if not encouraged, certainly not discouraged from relocating overseas (again, additional profit). Unsecured credit became a problem so many of the guidelines placed on second mortgages were ignored in order to secure credit. Home loan guidelines were loosened in order to continue the pattern of encouraging debt to drive demand while securing the self-same debt. This is not a shot at the Republicans. Bill Clinton is as guilty of perpetuating this system as Ronald Reagan was of putting it into play. So, how do we solve the problem? 1. Borrow more money to invest in project that may stimulate increased production in the private sector? 2. Let it fall apart and start from scratch? If we allow the entire system to collapse, if we drop the basic safety nets of our society and just let the foundations of our economy fail\u2026we need to be prepared for the repercussions. Potentially a complete social breakdown could result in revolution. I understand your concern that this country is moving toward socialism. If the system fails\u2026have you ever heard of a capitalist revolution? How do you expect to dramaticly increase wages while simultaniously raising taxes on the people who pay those wages? Isn't a tax cut the same as a wage increase? What is the difference in a 10% wage increase or a 10% tax cut? If you dramaticly increase wages won't prices on consumer goods increase as well? Don't higher production costs mean higher prices? I agree that companies must be given incentives to stay in the US and create jobs here at home. The best way to do this is to lower corporate tax rates. You can blame Reagan, Clinton, and Bush all you want but the fact of the matter is that these companies move overseas for cheaper labor, lower taxes, and because technological advances over the last thirty years have allowed them to do so. CEO's all the way down to lower management could do their jobs from home with a cell phone and a lap top. With that kind of freedom available to everyone at a cheap price, we have to offer huge incentives to keep business here in the US. Notice I said incentives, not penalties.
