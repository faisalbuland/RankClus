The reduction in violence is not an end in itself ... there must be some object in view to justify the expenditure of blood and treasure. When \"success\" means we have to stay longer, we ought to be looking for a different word to describe it. How about BS? That seems to be an appropriate description. For this whole GWOT. It will be the first war that cant win. How do we define a win on a GWOT? Or are we supposed to accept the fact that well be at war forever?

It has certainly been a tactical success, in that violence, at least against Iraqi civilians, has been reduced [although certainly not to levels that Americans would find anything but atrocious], but the strategic objective, political movement on the part of the Iraqis, has been minimal. The reduction in violence is not an end in itself ... there must be some object in view to justify the expenditure of blood and treasure. When \"success\" means we have to stay longer, we ought to be looking for a different word to describe it.",

The \"exiled\" one was Shinseki, who spoke only to numbers. Major General Petraeus' career, from the pacification of Mosul to COG Central Command followed a logical succession of important posts with ever increasing responsibility. He was never punished nor discounted. His success in Mosul stemmed partly from the fact that he had three times more troops than the unit that replaced him. He was a major General in 2003. There was a whole line of officers senior to him that had to be given their chance before he could assume four star rank and theater command. YOUR Heroes...used the term \"General Betrayus\" and OUR Secretary of State Ms Clinton, told him to his face that his summation of the situation in Iraq (after he had been there on the ground) required the willing suspension of disbelief. \"My\" Hero as you put it, placed him in command and gave him the tools to do the job. Involvement in the Iraq War 101st Airborne Division Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division, (Air Assault) looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla, and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, center, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, through the Al Shurja market in the Rusafa area of East Baghdad, Iraq, March 11, 2007.In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[90] Throughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing -- and maintaining -- persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[91][92][93] The strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in FM 3-24, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine,\" although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[94][95] Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers,\" to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[96]. Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq and based on his experiences has recently published, The Accidental Guerrilla, [97] and recently dicusses the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq, the father of the surge and other topics with the The Washington Post [98].

Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.After taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the \"surge\" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[99] By late May 2007, Congress did not impose any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[100] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq. In June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were \u201castonishing signs of normalcy\u201d in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that \"many problems remain\" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis \"stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence\" in late 2006.[101][102] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[103] These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[104][105] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2007) In July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[106] Petraeus' Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq on Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007. On August 15, 2007, The Los Angeles Times stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report \"would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government.\"[107] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that \"I wrote this testimony myself.\" He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress \"has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress.\"[108][109] In his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated that \"As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.\" He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[110] Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[111] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"Two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" He also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[112] Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity\".[113] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[114] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[115] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[116] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[117] On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[118] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341-79 vote on September 26.[119] In December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least\".[120] Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias\".[121] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2008) On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[122] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[123][124] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[125] Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq,\" while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[126] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[127][128] In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[134] Change of Command Iraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad on September 15, 2008.On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[134] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances\". Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[134] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[134] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[134] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, \"violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life.\"[135] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends Chart [8] clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others. U.S. Central Command (Fall 2008 to present) On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus is now responsible for US operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan\u2013including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.",

        "reply": " Jesus Christ. Get a little knowledge and perspective will ya? The \"exiled\" one was Shinseki, who spoke only to numbers. Major General Petraeus' career, from the pacification of Mosul to COG Central Command followed a logical succession of important posts with ever increasing responsibility. He was never punished nor discounted. His success in Mosul stemmed partly from the fact that he had three times more troops than the unit that replaced him. He was a major General in 2003. There was a whole line of officers senior to him that had to be given their chance before he could assume four star rank and theater command. YOUR Heroes...used the term \"General Betrayus\" and OUR Secretary of State Ms Clinton, told him to his face that his summation of the situation in Iraq (after he had been there on the ground) required the willing suspension of disbelief. \"My\" Hero as you put it, placed him in command and gave him the tools to do the job. Involvement in the Iraq War 101st Airborne Division Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division, (Air Assault) looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla, and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, center, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, through the Al Shurja market in the Rusafa area of East Baghdad, Iraq, March 11, 2007.In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[90] Throughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing -- and maintaining -- persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[91][92][93] The strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in FM 3-24, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine,\" although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[94][95] Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers,\" to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[96]. Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq and based on his experiences has recently published, The Accidental Guerrilla, [97] and recently dicusses the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq, the father of the surge and other topics with the The Washington Post [98].

Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[134] Change of Command Iraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad on September 15, 2008.On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[134] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances\". Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[134] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[134] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[134] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, \"violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life.\"[135] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends Chart [8] clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others. U.S. Central Command (Fall 2008 to present) On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus is now responsible for US operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan\u2013including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.",

It is just that those who sacrificed were never provided with a plan that would accomplish the lofty goals of the Bush Administration.

Involvement in the Iraq War 101st Airborne Division Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division, (Air Assault) looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla, and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, center, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, through the Al Shurja market in the Rusafa area of East Baghdad, Iraq, March 11, 2007.In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[90] Throughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing -- and maintaining -- persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[91][92][93] The strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in FM 3-24, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine,\" although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[94][95] Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers,\" to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[96]. Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq and based on his experiences has recently published, The Accidental Guerrilla, [97] and recently dicusses the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq, the father of the surge and other topics with the The Washington Post [98]. U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.After taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the \"surge\" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[99] By late May 2007, Congress did not impose any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[100] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq. In June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were \u201castonishing signs of normalcy\u201d in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that \"many problems remain\" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis \"stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence\" in late 2006.[101][102] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[103] These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[104][105] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2007) In July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[106] Petraeus' Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq on Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007. On August 15, 2007, The Los Angeles Times stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report \"would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government.\"[107] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that \"I wrote this testimony myself.\" He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress \"has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress.\"[108][109] In his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated that \"As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.\" He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[110] Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[111] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"Two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" He also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[112] Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity\".[113] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[114] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[115] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[116] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[117] On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[118] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341-79 vote on September 26.[119] In December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least\".[120] Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias\".[121] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2008) On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[122] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[123][124] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[125] Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq,\" while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[126] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[127][128] In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[134] Change of Command Iraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad on September 15, 2008.On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[134] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances\". Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[134] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[134] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[134] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, \"violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life.\"[135] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends Chart [8] clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others. U.S. Central Command (Fall 2008 to present) On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus is now responsible for US operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan\u2013including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.",

An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, center, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, through the Al Shurja market in the Rusafa area of East Baghdad, Iraq, March 11, 2007.In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[90] Throughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing -- and maintaining -- persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[91][92][93] The strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in FM 3-24, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine,\" although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[94][95] Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers,\" to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[96]. Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq and based on his experiences has recently published, The Accidental Guerrilla, [97] and recently dicusses the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq, the father of the surge and other topics with the The Washington Post [98]. U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.After taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the \"surge\" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[99] By late May 2007, Congress did not impose any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[100] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq. In June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were \u201castonishing signs of normalcy\u201d in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that \"many problems remain\" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis \"stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence\" in late 2006.[101][102] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[103] These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[104][105] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2007) In July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[106] Petraeus' Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq on Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007. On August 15, 2007, The Los Angeles Times stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report \"would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government.\"[107] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that \"I wrote this testimony myself.\" He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress \"has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress.\"[108][109] In his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated that \"As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.\" He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[110] Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[111] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"Two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" He also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[112] Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity\".[113] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[114] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[115] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[116] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[117] On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[118] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341-79 vote on September 26.[119] In December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least\".[120] Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias\".[121] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2008) On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[122] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[123][124] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[125] Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq,\" while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[126] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[127][128] In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[134] Change of Command Iraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad on September 15, 2008.On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[134] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances\". Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[134] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[134] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[134] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, \"violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life.\"[135] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends Chart [8] clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others. U.S. Central Command (Fall 2008 to present) On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus is now responsible for US operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan\u2013including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.",

The \"exiled\" one was Shinseki, who spoke only to numbers. Major General Petraeus' career, from the pacification of Mosul to COG Central Command followed a logical succession of important posts with ever increasing responsibility. He was never punished nor discounted. His success in Mosul stemmed partly from the fact that he had three times more troops than the unit that replaced him. He was a major General in 2003. There was a whole line of officers senior to him that had to be given their chance before he could assume four star rank and theater command. YOUR Heroes...used the term \"General Betrayus\" and OUR Secretary of State Ms Clinton, told him to his face that his summation of the situation in Iraq (after he had been there on the ground) required the willing suspension of disbelief. \"My\" Hero as you put it, placed him in command and gave him the tools to do the job. Involvement in the Iraq War 101st Airborne Division Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division, (Air Assault) looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla, and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, center, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, through the Al Shurja market in the Rusafa area of East Baghdad, Iraq, March 11, 2007.In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[90] Throughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing -- and maintaining -- persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[91][92][93] The strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in FM 3-24, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine,\" although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[94][95] Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers,\" to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[96]. Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq and based on his experiences has recently published, The Accidental Guerrilla, [97] and recently dicusses the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq, the father of the surge and other topics with the The Washington Post [98]. U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.After taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the \"surge\" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[99] By late May 2007, Congress did not impose any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[100] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq. In June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were \u201castonishing signs of normalcy\u201d in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that \"many problems remain\" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis \"stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence\" in late 2006.[101][102] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[103] These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[104][105] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2007) In July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[106] Petraeus' Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq on Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007. On August 15, 2007, The Los Angeles Times stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report \"would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government.\"[107] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that \"I wrote this testimony myself.\" He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress \"has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress.\"[108][109] In his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated that \"As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.\" He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[110] Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[111] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"Two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" He also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[112] Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity\".[113] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[114] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[115] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[116] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[117] On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[118] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341-79 vote on September 26.[119] In December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least\".[120] Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias\".[121] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2008) On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[122] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[123][124] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[125] Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq,\" while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[126] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[127][128] In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[134] Change of Command Iraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad on September 15, 2008.On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[134] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances\". Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[134] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[134] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[134] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, \"violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life.\"[135] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends Chart [8] clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others. U.S. Central Command (Fall 2008 to present) On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus is now responsible for US operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan\u2013including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.",

Major General Petraeus' career, from the pacification of Mosul to COG Central Command followed a logical succession of important posts with ever increasing responsibility. He was never punished nor discounted. His success in Mosul stemmed partly from the fact that he had three times more troops than the unit that replaced him. He was a major General in 2003. There was a whole line of officers senior to him that had to be given their chance before he could assume four star rank and theater command. YOUR Heroes...used the term \"General Betrayus\" and OUR Secretary of State Ms Clinton, told him to his face that his summation of the situation in Iraq (after he had been there on the ground) required the willing suspension of disbelief. \"My\" Hero as you put it, placed him in command and gave him the tools to do the job. Involvement in the Iraq War 101st Airborne Division Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division, (Air Assault) looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla, and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen.

Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[110] Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[111] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"Two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" He also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[112] Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity\".[113] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[114] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[115] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[116] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[117] On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[118] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341-79 vote on September 26.[119] In December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least\".[120] Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias\".[121] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2008) On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[122] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[123][124] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[125] Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq,\" while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[126] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[127][128] In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[134] Change of Command Iraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad on September 15, 2008.On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[134] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances\". Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[134] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[134] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[134] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, \"violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life.\"[135] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends Chart [8] clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others. U.S. Central Command (Fall 2008 to present) On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus is now responsible for US operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan\u2013including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.",

How does that fit in with policing Iraq, or the world for that matter. Im afraid after alls said and done well have to re enact Viet nam and the results will be the same. Pointless. The war in Iraq was not pointless, from a military point of view. Looking at a map of the Middle East, it does not take a military genius to see that Iraq is the strategic center of the Middle East. In a global war against radical Muslims, being in the middle of the region where all the 9/11 hijackers were from provides a strategic advantage. From Iraq it is also easy to keep tabs on Iran. President Bush would not be the first president to look at a map and the world situation and then exaggerate a threat to the United States (Gulf of Tonkin, \u201cRemember the Maine\u201d, etc.) to gain a strategic military advantage. He is the first to have the threat that he used to go to war debunked while still engaged in that war. What makes the war in Iraq seem pointless is that CinC Bush and his crew made so many miscalculation, misjudgments and mistakes during the planning, execution and occupation of Iraq that it turned into a no-win situation \u2013 what we have now.

        "reply": " The war in Iraq was not pointless, from a military point of view. Looking at a map of the Middle East, it does not take a military genius to see that Iraq is the strategic center of the Middle East. In a global war against radical Muslims, being in the middle of the region where all the 9/11 hijackers were from provides a strategic advantage. From Iraq it is also easy to keep tabs on Iran. President Bush would not be the first president to look at a map and the world situation and then exaggerate a threat to the United States (Gulf of Tonkin, \u201cRemember the Maine\u201d, etc.) to gain a strategic military advantage. He is the first to have the threat that he used to go to war debunked while still engaged in that war. What makes the war in Iraq seem pointless is that CinC Bush and his crew made so many miscalculation, misjudgments and mistakes during the planning, execution and occupation of Iraq that it turned into a no-win situation \u2013 what we have now.

        "content": "quote: Yeah, that's the same thing Patraeus wanted to do from the git-go before your hero's exiled him for having the right idea in the first place. His AO was always like that. Still doesn't change the fact that the surge was just a mechanism to give us enough wiggle room to exit with dignity. Jesus Christ. Get a little knowledge and perspective will ya? The \"exiled\" one was Shinseki, who spoke only to numbers. Major General Petraeus' career, from the pacification of Mosul to COG Central Command followed a logical succession of important posts with ever increasing responsibility. He was never punished nor discounted. His success in Mosul stemmed partly from the fact that he had three times more troops than the unit that replaced him. He was a major General in 2003. There was a whole line of officers senior to him that had to be given their chance before he could assume four star rank and theater command. YOUR Heroes...used the term \"General Betrayus\" and OUR Secretary of State Ms Clinton, told him to his face that his summation of the situation in Iraq (after he had been there on the ground) required the willing suspension of disbelief. \"My\" Hero as you put it, placed him in command and gave him the tools to do the job. Involvement in the Iraq War 101st Airborne Division Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division, (Air Assault) looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla, and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, center, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, through the Al Shurja market in the Rusafa area of East Baghdad, Iraq, March 11, 2007.In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[90] Throughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing -- and maintaining -- persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[91][92][93] The strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in FM 3-24, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine,\" although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[94][95] Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers,\" to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[96]. Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq and based on his experiences has recently published, The Accidental Guerrilla, [97] and recently dicusses the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq, the father of the surge and other topics with the The Washington Post [98]. U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.After taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the \"surge\" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[99] By late May 2007, Congress did not impose any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[100] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq. In June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were \u201castonishing signs of normalcy\u201d in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that \"many problems remain\" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis \"stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence\" in late 2006.[101][102] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[103] These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[104][105] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2007) In July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[106] Petraeus' Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq on Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007. On August 15, 2007, The Los Angeles Times stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report \"would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government.\"[107] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that \"I wrote this testimony myself.\" He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress \"has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress.\"[108][109] In his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated that \"As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.\" He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[110] Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[111] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"Two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" He also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[112] Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity\".[113] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[114] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[115] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[116] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[117] On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[118] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341-79 vote on September 26.[119] In December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least\".[120] Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias\".[121] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2008) On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[122] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[123][124] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[125] Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq,\" while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[126] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[127][128] In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat...

        "reply": " Jesus Christ. Get a little knowledge and perspective will ya? The \"exiled\" one was Shinseki, who spoke only to numbers. Major General Petraeus' career, from the pacification of Mosul to COG Central Command followed a logical succession of important posts with ever increasing responsibility. He was never punished nor discounted. His success in Mosul stemmed partly from the fact that he had three times more troops than the unit that replaced him. He was a major General in 2003. There was a whole line of officers senior to him that had to be given their chance before he could assume four star rank and theater command. YOUR Heroes...used the term \"General Betrayus\" and OUR Secretary of State Ms Clinton, told him to his face that his summation of the situation in Iraq (after he had been there on the ground) required the willing suspension of disbelief. \"My\" Hero as you put it, placed him in command and gave him the tools to do the job. Involvement in the Iraq War 101st Airborne Division Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division, (Air Assault) looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla, and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus's time with the 101st is his asking of embedded Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to \"Tell me how this ends,\"[42] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[43][44][45][46][47][48] In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, [49][50][51] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects.[52] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in places like Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was \"prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized,\" according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[53] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[49][54] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[55][56][57] Newsweek has stated that \"It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus.\"[58] One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[59][60][61] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer \"Money is ammunition\" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[62][63] Petraeus' often repeated[64][65][66][67] catchphrase[68] was later incorporated into official military briefings[69][70] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.[71] In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a unit roughly one quarter its size - a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004. There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left\".[72] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith, a paid adviser to the Kurdish Regional Government,[73] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.[74] He wrote for The New York Review of Books that \"Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police.\"[75] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that \"Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had--and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques.\" Ricks went on to note that \"the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006.\"[76] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st \"didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done.\" Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, \"they were occupiers, not builders.\"[77] New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus \"did it right and won over Mosul.\"[78] Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly-created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing Army, Police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II,\" at a cost of over $11 billion.[79] In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"[80] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency -- or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at.\" Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, \"under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army.\"[81] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures-- particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[82][83] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[84][85] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[86] The Independent has stated that the military believed \"the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter.\"[87] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[88] Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely-read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[89] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2007) The commanding general of the 9th Iraqi Army Division, right, speaks with a journalist from the Al-Arabiyah news channel, left, as they walk with U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, center, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, through the Al Shurja market in the Rusafa area of East Baghdad, Iraq, March 11, 2007.In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[90] Throughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing -- and maintaining -- persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[91][92][93] The strategy underpinning the \"surge\" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in FM 3-24, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the \"Petraeus Doctrine,\" although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the \"Petraeus Doctrine\" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[94][95] Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed \"Petraeus guys\" or \"designated thinkers,\" to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus's closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[96]. Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq and based on his experiences has recently published, The Accidental Guerrilla, [97] and recently dicusses the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq, the father of the surge and other topics with the The Washington Post [98]. U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.After taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the \"surge\" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[99] By late May 2007, Congress did not impose any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[100] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq. In June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were \u201castonishing signs of normalcy\u201d in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that \"many problems remain\" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis \"stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence\" in late 2006.[101][102] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[103] These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[104][105] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2007) In July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[106] Petraeus' Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq on Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007. On August 15, 2007, The Los Angeles Times stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report \"would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government.\"[107] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that \"I wrote this testimony myself.\" He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress \"has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress.\"[108][109] In his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated that \"As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.\" He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[110] Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' \"plan is just more of the same\" and \"is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need.\" Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of \"cherry-picking statistics\" and \"massaging information\".[111] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker \"Two of our nation's most capable public servants\" and said Democrats feel \"esteem for their professionalism.\" He also said that \"We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value\"; concluding, \"We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own.\"[112] Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report \"a candid, independent assessment given with integrity\".[113] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that \"I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"[114] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying \"It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault.\"[115] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[116] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[117] On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[118] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341-79 vote on September 26.[119] In December 2007, The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" stated that \"While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least\".[120] Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be \"shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias\".[121] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Spring 2008) On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that \"the U.S. effort has shown more success\" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, \"U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad.\"[122] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[123][124] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[125] Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq,\" while also noting that \"the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain\" and that \"the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible.\" He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[126] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings \"lacked the suspense of last September's debate,\" but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[127][128] In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that \"we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.\"[129] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a \"whole of government\" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[130] After Petraeus's returned to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[131] Multi-National Force - Iraq (Summer and Fall 2008) In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term \"victory\" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying \"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.\"[132] Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that \"an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of \u2014 and responsive to \u2014 its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community\" could arguably be called 'victory'.[133] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that \"I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges.\"[134] Change of Command Iraq Defense Minister Abdul Qadir presents a gift to Petraeus during a farewell ceremony in Baghdad on September 15, 2008.On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[134] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus \"played a historic role\" and created the \"translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances\". Gates also told Petraeus he believed \"history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains.\"[134] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[134] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[134] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that \"the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure.\" Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007.

Somebody, somewhere has saved every daily situation brief from Iraq. One day you will be able to see them and you will be able to tell to the week when the deafening silence fell. I was there. I was there in May-June 2007. It got absolutely crazy with the IEDs. The insurgents started dropping bridges across Tampa. Two thirds of my unit's casualties occured in those months. My vehicle M-1117 was hit three times, and finally destroyed with a basketball sized hole blown in it. On our last mission, our last NCO out transitioning the replacement unit was even hit. We were escorting the trans units moving the surge's equipment in. By July? When the surge units were in place and operating? You could almost hear crickets chirping. So what is it again you guys were going to tell ME?",

But do you actually believe that being there as an enlisted man gives you any more insight into the politics of that cluster F than anyone else?? Your there to do a job and follow orders and not question them and if you didnt believe in them orders it would be difficult to function. Just being there gives you no more insight into politics than anyone else you just experience the results of political decisions and follow orders doing the best you can.",
