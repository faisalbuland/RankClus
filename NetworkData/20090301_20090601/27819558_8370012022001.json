The commercial, produced by the antigay National Organization for Marriage, shows a group of actors discussing how the \"storm is gathering\" because same-sex marriage has been legalized in four states. The fake doctors and church attendants discuss how new advances in gay rights will take away their \"freedom\" and make it impossible for them to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The ad will run in places like New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and California -- states on the front lines of the marriage-equality movement.
