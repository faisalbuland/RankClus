Oh, did I mention that Limbaugh has the NUMBER ONE RATED RADIO TALK SHOW IN AMERICA, listened to by both Conservatives and Liberals! I think I did. Thats a BIG BS. He is not doing his part to do sqawt. His facts are just as twisted as he is. Being in a position that is NOT Accountable to anyone and then blabbing about how right he is is pure BS. I bet C2C radio talk show has more listeners than he does! Who cares!... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
