Yes, I agree, the military husband has it tough too. quoting 'Sweetsuds' post: Yes, Navy husbands don't get nearly as much praise as they deserve. It takes a real man to stand by his woman when she's risking her neck halfway across the world. I am a Stuntwoman in the movies. Other than the intense training and skills, the job requires great courage. But this is nothing compared to what military or law enforcement personnel must face. We go on screen and PRETEND to be heroes. I have played a military soldier twice, and a few times I played a police officer. To be frank, each time I did not feel worthy of wearing the uniform, even though it was a COSTUME in a movie. Hats off to you military personnel. Whether or not one is in favor of war, he/she should reflect on how valuable these fine people are to our country.",
