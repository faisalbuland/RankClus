The American People are currently experiencing an unprecedented crises on a level that is acutely unparalled in our brief history..... Our many global and internal enemies have finally implemented their pre-existing plans to aggressively confront American interests at every opportunity. These insidious enemies have patiently watched and waited as more and more of our Washington politicians continued to demonstrate the cooruption, ineptitude, and sever lack of patriotism needed to effeciently guide the course of our beloved nation..... With the tragedy of 9-11 the battle for America's survival has truly begun. China, Russia, North Korea, Syria, Iraq, & Iran, are dedicated enemies of the American People and these differing idealogies together have developed a formidable plan of action to disrupt and eventually destroy all we as Americans hold dear. Of course China is developing super high tech weaponry as described in this news article and of course they will continue to challenge and harass our naval forces at sea. These relentless enemies of the American People have set in motion a force of action designed to ultimately destroy the national will and resolve of this nation of freedom loving people to continue to exists. As many loyal Americans have expressed: The reason the American People are experiencing this unfortunate and perilous time is due to a 20 + year Washington Politician leadership vaccuum. Our enemies have observed for far to long the weakness and immorality of so many our elected officials..... I will give one example: 20+ years ago the United States Navy had an active 600 warship fleet. Today that same proud Navy has less than 300 active ships to patrol the globe and protect the American People. The latest Pirate's ( Terrorist) incident involving an American maritime Vessel has demonstrated for all to see that our outstanding Navy cannot perform it's absolutely vital role with so few ships. What inept and amaturish Washington politician or committee or what ever could have possibly developed or approved such a completely ludicrous, disasterous plan as this one ??? It is my belief as well asthe belief of many other loyal American's that the saving of America from disaster shall be brough about by the positive and courageous actions of the American Patriot..... They remain in existence, more than we may realize and through the valor of their determined actions there may yet be time to save this blessed land..... There may yet be time...... Thank You L.F.",

With high tech weapons, they can obliterate the Taiwanese military and their weapons while not destroying the infrastructure that makes the Island the jewel that it is.
