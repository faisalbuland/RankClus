When I tried to place my order, the voice said they were closed. I said the sign said they open 24 hours. She told me that because they had to set the clocks back, they were closed for hour. If they stayed open, they would actually be open 25 hours. I asked her how they made up the hour in the spring, since they were only open 23 hours the day we set the clocks up. She called a smartazz and suggested I take my food order somewhere else. I still go there once in a while. I always ask if they are open before placing my order.",
