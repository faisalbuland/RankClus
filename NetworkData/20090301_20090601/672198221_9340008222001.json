What is surprising is the fact that the USAF would dare request ANYTHING without first being TOLD by Gates what they could have or request. Gates is systemically realigning the USAF and its role or mission without the benefit of feedback from the USAF leaders. Should they (the USAF leaders) dare to be so bold as to formally request additional C-17s or F-22s or anything else that has not been previously blessed by Gates, he would simply fire them for not support him. You must remember, he had each General sign a pledge of support and it included a gag order or be fired for not signing. It will be interesting to see what if anything is left of the USAF in 3 years 9 months and should there still be a USAF, what its capabilities will be in terms of a multi theater world wide mission.",
