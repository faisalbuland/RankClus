I pretty much agree with that ... except I believe the cartels would simply intensify their efforts in other product areas.

According to the Federal Government, 90 percent of weed in home grown. But what if you were right? What if ALL of it came from Mexico? Who's fault would that be? If weed was legal, American farmers would cash in - Do you doubt this?

The drug cartels that rely on its growth and distribution would be totally gone in six months. I have never seen a plant as easy to grow as Weed is. The illegal drug cartels couldn\u2019t manipulate that market\u2026 neither could the legal drug industries (medicine, alcohol, tobacco). So for clearing the cartels\u2026 legalizing the use, growth, and possession would be the quickest solution.",
        "reply": " I pretty much agree with that ... except I believe the cartels would simply intensify their efforts in other product areas. What sparks my comment is the observation you made the marijuana is so easy to grow ... That would seem to put a crimp in the \"regulate it and tax the heck out of it\" crowd's argument.",
