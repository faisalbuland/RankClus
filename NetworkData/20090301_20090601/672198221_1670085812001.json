        "content": "The tragic events that lead to the deaths of three law enforcement officers, and life threatening injuries to a fourth in Oakland, CA. this week, will no doubt be twisted by the liberal politicians and media into another hyped up reason to ban \"assault\" rifles. But the facts speak volumes against such a ban. Fact #1, The scumbag who commited these murders had an extensive criminal history, and it was illegal for him to own ANY weapon. Of course this didn't even slow him down from having at least two weapons, including the \"assault\" rifle. Fact #2, The state where this crime was commited was California, which has extensive anti-gun legislation, including one of the strictest bans in the nation on \"assault\" weapons. Fact #3, The newest \"spin\" on reimposing the \"assault\" weapons ban, (A law that didn't prevent crimes last time it was tried), is to say it's to stem the tide of illegal weapons flowing to Mexican drugs cartels. Here's a thought, how about actually securing the borders, who's security to date has been a running joke never properly adressed, even seven plus years since 9/11 should have made it a priority. Drug cartels aren't coming to the U.S. gunshops to buy their weapons, Central America has enough AK-47's availible to keep them happy for decades to come, and what guns do travel across the border are sold by criminals to criminals. Fact #4, This crime was a prime example of the truth. Any ban, will only apply to those who obey the law in the first place. Criminals by their very definition don't care one bit about the ban, and the vast majority of those who will lose a sizeable portion of their 2nd Amendment Right to Keep and Bear Arms, will be the law obiding public. Anyone who because they don't personally own an \"assault\" weapon, who feels that it's \"not that big a deal\", is not keying up to the fact the liberals don't just want to ban \"assault\" weapons, their ultimate goal is to ban ALL firearms, and a key provision of our Constitutional Rights as well. The \"assault\" weapons ban is merely a first step, not the ultimate goal they have. Fact #5, Most importantly, our founding fathers placed the 2nd Amendment into our Constitution, not to assure our right to hunt game or go target shooting, but to ensure every law abiding American's absolute right to defend themselves, not just from criminals, but most importantly defend against our own government ever sliding into a dictatorship, or worse. Thankfully that has never been the case, not in the 240 years of our proud history. But the 2nd Amendment needs to be held intact, to ensure another 240 years and beyond of peaceful democracy.

Thankfully that has never been the case, not in the 240 years of our proud history. But the 2nd Amendment needs to be held intact, to ensure another 240 years and beyond of peaceful democracy. Well put - I agree 100 percent! As far as self defense goes, the Founders laid little emphasis on that question. And this was because they took it for granted!

But the facts speak volumes against such a ban. Fact #1, The scumbag who commited these murders had an extensive criminal history, and it was illegal for him to own ANY weapon. Of course this didn't even slow him down from having at least two weapons, including the \"assault\" rifle. Fact #2, The state where this crime was commited was California, which has extensive anti-gun legislation, including one of the strictest bans in the nation on \"assault\" weapons. Fact #3, The newest \"spin\" on reimposing the \"assault\" weapons ban, (A law that didn't prevent crimes last time it was tried), is to say it's to stem the tide of illegal weapons flowing to Mexican drugs cartels. Here's a thought, how about actually securing the borders, who's security to date has been a running joke never properly adressed, even seven plus years since 9/11 should have made it a priority. Drug cartels aren't coming to the U.S. gunshops to buy their weapons, Central America has enough AK-47's availible to keep them happy for decades to come, and what guns do travel across the border are sold by criminals to criminals. Fact #4, This crime was a prime example of the truth. Any ban, will only apply to those who obey the law in the first place. Criminals by their very definition don't care one bit about the ban, and the vast majority of those who will lose a sizeable portion of their 2nd Amendment Right to Keep and Bear Arms, will be the law obiding public. Anyone who because they don't personally own an \"assault\" weapon, who feels that it's \"not that big a deal\", is not keying up to the fact the liberals don't just want to ban \"assault\" weapons, their ultimate goal is to ban ALL firearms, and a key provision of our Constitutional Rights as well.

But the facts speak volumes against such a ban. Fact #1, The scumbag who commited these murders had an extensive criminal history, and it was illegal for him to own ANY weapon. Of course this didn't even slow him down from having at least two weapons, including the \"assault\" rifle. Fact #2, The state where this crime was commited was California, which has extensive anti-gun legislation, including one of the strictest bans in the nation on \"assault\" weapons. Fact #3, The newest \"spin\" on reimposing the \"assault\" weapons ban, (A law that didn't prevent crimes last time it was tried), is to say it's to stem the tide of illegal weapons flowing to Mexican drugs cartels. Here's a thought, how about actually securing the borders, who's security to date has been a running joke never properly adressed, even seven plus years since 9/11 should have made it a priority. Drug cartels aren't coming to the U.S. gunshops to buy their weapons, Central America has enough AK-47's availible to keep them happy for decades to come, and what guns do travel across the border are sold by criminals to criminals. Fact #4, This crime was a prime example of the truth. Any ban, will only apply to those who obey the law in the first place. Criminals by their very definition don't care one bit about the ban, and the vast majority of those who will lose a sizeable portion of their 2nd Amendment Right to Keep and Bear Arms, will be the law obiding public. Anyone who because they don't personally own an \"assault\" weapon, who feels that it's \"not that big a deal\", is not keying up to the fact the liberals don't just want to ban \"assault\" weapons, their ultimate goal is to ban ALL firearms, and a key provision of our Constitutional Rights as well. The \"assault\" weapons ban is merely a first step, not the ultimate goal they have. Fact #5, Most importantly, our founding fathers placed the 2nd Amendment into our Constitution, not to assure our right to hunt game or go target shooting, but to ensure every law abiding American's absolute right to defend themselves, not just from criminals, but most importantly defend against our own government ever sliding into a dictatorship, or worse. Thankfully that has never been the case, not in the 240 years of our proud history. But the 2nd Amendment needs to be held intact, to ensure another 240 years and beyond of peaceful democracy.

Thankfully that has never been the case, not in the 240 years of our proud history. But the 2nd Amendment needs to be held intact, to ensure another 240 years and beyond of peaceful democracy.

Fact #5, Most importantly, our founding fathers placed the 2nd Amendment into our Constitution, not to assure our right to hunt game or go target shooting, but to ensure every law abiding American's absolute right to defend themselves, not just from criminals, but most importantly defend against our own government ever sliding into a dictatorship, or worse. Thankfully that has never been the case, not in the 240 years of our proud history. But the 2nd Amendment needs to be held intact, to ensure another 240 years and beyond of peaceful democracy.

In the revolution anyone that had enough coin and respect of the manpower available formed and financed militia. A guy by the name of Monroe tried to form one without success. To make a long story short, at the end of the war very little money was in the coffers to pay the troops to they gave them their muskets, later Hamilton came up with the idea of issueing Bonds guaranteed by the new government for theidr payment. You might check out the next paragraph (article III) in the Constitution. Says soldiers can't take your privacy and be quartered in your home without consent. Now they (per Marshall) tell you that invasion of your premises cannot be prevented by using force. Doesn't make sense to build in a zone for a private citizen and then take it away with laws saying the opposite. We are to plead with Drug addicts and thieves for 15 minutes (average) while the police are on their way. With my pistol and 12 gauge I would have a chance. With Marshall, I don't think so.",

I'm not writing to oppose the Second Amendment. But I really don't see the point in the title of this thread. This incident is not an argument for or against owning rifles (and there is no such thing as an \"assualt rifle\") The OP is worried about us losing our Second Amendment rights - Good for him - But this is not an argument either for and against. Here is his point five: quote: Fact #5, Most importantly, our founding fathers placed the 2nd Amendment into our Constitution, not to assure our right to hunt game or go target shooting, but to ensure every law abiding American's absolute right to defend themselves, not just from criminals, but most importantly defend against our own government ever sliding into a dictatorship, or worse. Thankfully that has never been the case, not in the 240 years of our proud history. But the 2nd Amendment needs to be held intact, to ensure another 240 years and beyond of peaceful democracy. Well put - I agree 100 percent! As far as self defense goes, the Founders laid little emphasis on that question. And this was because they took it for granted! That todays society actually questions this is in and of itself revealing. Dave",
