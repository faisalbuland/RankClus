Mainedawg Moderator Maybe I am missing something here but when following this thread which was started with an outside link to an article, like many of these posts, which attempts to push an agenda and compare America to another country, which seems to me, to try to show that America is behind the times with our culture and ways of life.

It is hard for me not to see the relevance of a post containing a question which seems to follow suit with the customs and ways of other posters and their persistence on valid and invalid points. quote: Now you're just simply being unfair and picking & choosing a policy that supports YOUR agenda. Why can't you answer the question of: why not review ALL of Israel's policies and adopt THEM, too? This appears to me to be someone defending their country and belief sets against a subtle attack on them. Personally, I don't care what or how other posters post. If I have a problem with someone, I speak my peace to them.

Sweden is likely to become the seventh in May.\" Horowitz is an openly gay \"first termer\" who is trying to push his agenda in the Knesset. Many people have come and tried the same thing and been rejected. The way your \"source\" has labeled it where \"The Israeli Knesset is set to consider granting gay and lesbian couples the right to marry.\" may sound good but \"consider is the key word and it seems like the Meretz party is the only one doing the considering.

When I turned 16, I came out of the closet, and he had trouble accepting that.\" The same year, Even revealed in the Knesset that he was ejected from the Shin Bet security service when his employers discovered he was gay, after he had been working there for 15 years. \"I decided to speak to the only homosexual I knew,\" said Even-Kama. \"One day I went down to a public phone, all shivering, and called 'that professor from TV.'\" When it became clear that his relationship with his family was not going to improve, Even and Kama offered the teenager the shelter of their home.\" Sounds like the same controversy happens in Israel that we have here in America. Plus HAARETZ is an extremist, agenda pushing news source that can not be taken as an unbiased, neutral source. I think it's funny, personally, that they publish an article about a gay couple adopting a 30 year old man and try to spin it, as if Israel is ready and paving the way for letting homosexuals adopt. The only thing all of this shows me is that with the current economic crisis, Israel dealing with the thought of exchanging 1000 terrorists in exchange for one of their soldiers in captivity, and the Israeli-Palestine conflict, the gay politicians care about one thing and one thing only, their agenda, and continue to push it as if it is the most important issue right now.

Plus HAARETZ is an extremist, agenda pushing news source that can not be taken as an unbiased, neutral source. I think it's funny, personally, that they publish an article about a gay couple adopting a 30 year old man and try to spin it, as if Israel is ready and paving the way for letting homosexuals adopt. The only thing all of this shows me is that with the current economic crisis, Israel dealing with the thought of exchanging 1000 terrorists in exchange for one of their soldiers in captivity, and the Israeli-Palestine conflict, the gay politicians care about one thing and one thing only, their agenda, and continue to push it as if it is the most important issue right now. In that America and Israel are very similar. On Military.com we are not allowed to post \"complete\" articles due to copy-right infringements. You can be suspended from this site for doing so. That is why he didn't post the complete article. Gay politicians care for more than just the gay issues. They vote and support many other issues that are not related to homosexuals. Your supposition that \"gay politicians care about one thing and one thing only, their agenda\" is unfounded. In American, as in Israel, politicians are required to debate and push many issues including but not limited to - the most important ones such as the current financial mess.

Sweden is likely to become the seventh in May.\" Horowitz is an openly gay \"first termer\" who is trying to push his agenda in the Knesset. Many people have come and tried the same thing and been rejected. The way your \"source\" has labeled it where \"The Israeli Knesset is set to consider granting gay and lesbian couples the right to marry.\" may sound good but \"consider is the key word and it seems like the Meretz party is the only one doing the considering.

When I turned 16, I came out of the closet, and he had trouble accepting that.\" The same year, Even revealed in the Knesset that he was ejected from the Shin Bet security service when his employers discovered he was gay, after he had been working there for 15 years. \"I decided to speak to the only homosexual I knew,\" said Even-Kama. \"One day I went down to a public phone, all shivering, and called 'that professor from TV.'\" When it became clear that his relationship with his family was not going to improve, Even and Kama offered the teenager the shelter of their home.\" Sounds like the same controversy happens in Israel that we have here in America. Plus HAARETZ is an extremist, agenda pushing news source that can not be taken as an unbiased, neutral source. I think it's funny, personally, that they publish an article about a gay couple adopting a 30 year old man and try to spin it, as if Israel is ready and paving the way for letting homosexuals adopt. The only thing all of this shows me is that with the current economic crisis, Israel dealing with the thought of exchanging 1000 terrorists in exchange for one of their soldiers in captivity, and the Israeli-Palestine conflict, the gay politicians care about one thing and one thing only, their agenda, and continue to push it as if it is the most important issue right now. In that America and Israel are very similar.",
