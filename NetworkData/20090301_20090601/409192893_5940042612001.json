        "reply": " True, the GOPis not in power. So they make an issue of earmarks and then place thousands of earmarks into the spending bill. That is one reason they have so few elected officials in Congress \u2013 they say one thing and do another. \u201cSpending is now out of control and will bankrupt the next generation\u201d is what Republicans are saying now. They leave out the fact that n the twelve years that the Republicans held majorities in Congress (1994 to 2006), six of which there was a Republican president, the national dept increased by $4.075 trillion \u2013 almost doubling what it was when they came to power. Democrats don\u2019t try to be fiscally responsible, they tax and spend. Republicans say they are fiscally responsible, but borrow and spend. Which is worse?",
