        "content": "I'm new to the forum, a disabled vet from OIF II. My brother is a 1LT in the Army National Guard. He is considering going active duty and enlisting. He has 14 years of active duty enlisted service, and a bunch more national guard service as an enlisted person, as well as an officer. He became an officer, went to Iraq, and is now back in the NG awaiting word on his promotion to CPT. If he doesn't get the promotion, is it possible for him to surrender his commission and go active duty enlisted? If so, what rank could he enlist at (he was an army SGT before he became a LT). From what I have read he can have no more than 14 years active duty to do this. Is this true? He's got 14 years going on his 15th year. Any help would be appreciated. Les",
