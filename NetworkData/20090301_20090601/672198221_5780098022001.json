First of all, multiple sources indicate this was conducted by SEAL Team VI, aka Naval Special Warfare Development Group, aka \u201cDevGru.\u201d This is the naval equivalent of Delta Force. Allen says the team likely were on the intel of the incident very soon after news hit the wires about the capture and were already well in advance of developing a plan to rescue Phillips before they deployed to the USS Bainbridge. It\u2019s unclear why the team decided to parachute onto the scene under cover of darkness from a C-17 with rafts. One possibility is that this was a far more covert entry than simply landing on the destroyer via helicopter, or Allen says it could have been due to range restrictions\u2026did the DevGru guys travel straight from Little Creek, Va.? Probably. There was no rest and relaxation or getting rid of the jetlag for the team. Allen estimates they were planning and rehearsing shortly after arriving aboard the Bainbridge. Delay was, however, in their favor, Allen said, since food was running out, sleep was short and the weather was worsening for the ill-trained pirates who probably were beginning to realize they bit off more than they could chew. Whether it was luck or planning, clearly the idea to tow the life boat behind the Bainbridge and reel it into closer range made a sniper takedown much more of a reasonable possibility than any other tactic, sources say. A shot of 80-90 feet \u2014 even at night and in rolling seas \u2014 is a cakewalk for DevGru SEALs. \u201cThese guys can put three rounds onto the head of a quarter at that range,\u201d Allen told me. And let\u2019s not get carried away with the sea state, says DT contributor Joe Buff. A multi-thousand ton destroyer is a pretty stable platform in any but the most tumultuous sea states and makes dialing in a shot on an admittedly tossing life raft more doable \u2014 a smart platform for the Team to operate from. We also have some information \u2014 unconfirmed, though we\u2019re working on it \u2014 about how the shots were taken and what was used. Our firearms expert Eric Poole who writes for Tactical-Life posits that the snipers were using the MK-11 .308 sniper system manufactured by Knights Armament Co. This weapon is awesome, by the way (I\u2019ve shot it a few times myself) and, if this is indeed what the shooters used, would mark a major, high-profile departure from legacy thinking about sniping which holds bolt-action rifles as the Gold Standard or marksmanship. Poole figures the DevGru frogmen removed the \u201coverpowered\u201d standard-issue Leupold scopes and opted for the Aimpoint CCO augmented by the PVS-14 night vision monocular. Though the SEAL version of the MK-11 Mod 0 is issued with suppressors, it\u2019s unclear whether the operators used them, but I\u2019d bet a million bucks they did.
