All evidence in your posts points to the fact that you will throw up any roadblock you can think of to full and honest service by gays, full or partial. You spend so much time dreaming up objections and reasons that it shouldn't be so that you miss how simple the process has been in practice i other militaries that we base our own military traditions upon. The proposal you refer to is not just unworkable, it is chilling in its scope and based on a premise of pure fantasy. It has a juvenile understanding of sexuality, and a basis in fear. Here is a counter-proposal for you, and I don't even need 14 pages to explain it (oh, wait, but I'm \"on ignore\" for failure to agree with you): 1. Afford gays and bisexuals the same opportunities, rights, and responsibilities in their private lives as straights. 2. Kick gays, bisexuals and straights out of the military when their attitude towards sexuality of any kind becomes a problem. In explanation, if a gay person sexually harasses any other person, gay or straight, kick them out. Ditto for straight people. If a servicemember uses sexual favors, gay or straight, to procure favorable treatment, kick them out. If a gay, bisexual or straight person physically theatens or bullies another member due to sexual preference, kick the bully out. Make the rules zero tolerance, and make them apply equally across the board. 3. Bring UCMJ articles on sexual behavior in line with the standard the US Supreme Court has set for civilian governments. It really is that simple. It is interesting that you advocate a proposal with oodles of restrictions and tracking for gays, but none for straights. It seems that you still feel that gays are predatory, and that straights need to be somehow protected from this minority class. That is a prejudicial attitude at heart, whether you recognizer it or not.",

You spend so much time dreaming up objections and reasons that it shouldn't be so that you miss how simple the process has been in practice i other militaries that we base our own military traditions upon.

Afford gays and bisexuals the same opportunities, rights, and responsibilities in their private lives as straights. 2. Kick gays, bisexuals and straights out of the military when their attitude towards sexuality of any kind becomes a problem. In explanation, if a gay person sexually harasses any other person, gay or straight, kick them out. Ditto for straight people. If a servicemember uses sexual favors, gay or straight, to procure favorable treatment, kick them out. If a gay, bisexual or straight person physically theatens or bullies another member due to sexual preference, kick the bully out. Make the rules zero tolerance, and make them apply equally across the board. 3. Bring UCMJ articles on sexual behavior in line with the standard the US Supreme Court has set for civilian governments. It really is that simple. It is interesting that you advocate a proposal with oodles of restrictions and tracking for gays, but none for straights. It seems that you still feel that gays are predatory, and that straights need to be somehow protected from this minority class.

Nope, no \"modification\". We have had over ten years of the \"compromise\" that is known as DADT. It was NOT a compromise for gay and lesbians in the service, only the straight ones that want to pretend the gays aren't really there. (While we still get discharged at a rate of 2 per day) The only modification will be doing away with it entirely and allowing gays and lesbians to serve honestly. As I was responding to Bleah, reckon I'll wait for his/her answer.",
