Yup, same thing in the King Case. Everything was done outstanding up until they started beating him AFTER he was subdued...that was excessive force. Everything leading up to that was textbook...i'm actually surprised they tased him and didn't just shoot his drugged up arse. But that is for another time. These guys did use some excessive force and should be punished accordingly...heat of the moment or not, that is what training is for. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",

That's why they have the authority they do; BUT, they must use it judiciously and give the person the maximum reasonable benefit of the doubt whenever possible, lest they wrongly \"break the law in the name of enforcing the law.\" That is the WORST, most counterproductive and purely destructive thing to do. 'Legalized' thugs are no better than outright criminals. It's a tight line they walk, but no one is holding guns to their heads, making them TAKE the job of being a police person or other LEO position/agency. Training, full accountability, restraint, and self control all go hand in hand on this job. Lose any of them, and you can lose ALL of them, plus yours or other's lives. Let's not forget that ordinary people's lives have value, too. They won't get a parade from THEIR friends and co-workers when THEY get killed, no matter how, or by whose bullets or weapons. The \"US vs. THEM\" L.E.O. mentality is poisonous and very dangerous. Just look at the policeman who ignored the black man he stopped at the Texas hospital, whose mother was literally DYING as the officer detained him for 15 minutes. Had the officer OBSERVED the driver's activated 4-WAY FLASHERS, among other things, like the car pulling into the hospital, he might have wisely figured out something was wrong that the driver justified his actions with. But NO, the cop got an attitude, and refused the man a chance to see his dying mother or mother-in-law until it was too late. The cop could have followed them into the ER, verified what was happening, and dealt with it in an entirely different, more humane way than he did. I'm happy he quit...he should have, and wisely did. However, the mother is dead and gone. That fact cannot be rewound and replayed with another less painful outcome. Training...observation...rationality...putting vitriolic, volatile emotions on HOLD. On-scene discretion...perspective and patience. All are part of the personality traits required to do the job, tough as it is, consistently and conscientiously, without becoming a liability or a risk, nor creating the same in and with other suspects, subjects and people police have to interact with. That's the bottom line. By the illegal and out-of-control, rash actions of the police, (the beatings) they may have cost themselves the very case against that schmuck they were chasing. Was the venting of their anger upon that suspect worth the cost of their jobs and/or the criminal case itself? I think not! Such displays of illegal and harmful conduct and actions by police and others with authority against subjects does far more harm and serves to quickly undermine the police and government authority in general, than many people even realize, exacerbating the problems and making the already hard job of keeping the peace and enforcing the law that much harder. It's dangerously counterproductive, and the public trust and confidence is already hard enough to win over and keep as it is, without the illegal, criminal conduct of officials behind the badge...ANY 'badge', no matter HOW it is 'justified'. No, I'm NOT AT ALL AGAINST law enforcement...just ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL, ABUSIVE law enFORCEment and authority. There is NO PLACE for any of that!",

Such displays of illegal and harmful conduct and actions by police and others with authority against subjects does far more harm and serves to quickly undermine the police and government authority in general, than many people even realize, exacerbating the problems and making the already hard job of keeping the peace and enforcing the law that much harder. It's dangerously counterproductive, and the public trust and confidence is already hard enough to win over and keep as it is, without the illegal, criminal conduct of officials behind the badge...ANY 'badge', no matter HOW it is 'justified'. No, I'm NOT AT ALL AGAINST law enforcement...just ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL, ABUSIVE law enFORCEment and authority. There is NO PLACE for any of that!",

For the most of us who have been around for awhile, we can recall other brutality complaints following the panic and outrage resulting from dangerous pursuits. I doubt this will be the last one we will be reading about. Sadly the felon will probably be compensated more from a lawsuit than he's ever legitimately ever made in his life. This will come from the tax base. An oldtimer once said to me, \"Do nothing, lose nothing\". I've never subscibed to that motto and have remained active. However the priciple of discipline is to match the correct amount of punishment to the offender. Wouldn't 20 years of exemplary service mean anything to this mayor? Would the seasoned veteran be treated the same as a rookie? Wouldn't a 20 or 30 day suspension be enough? How about 6 months? Is the penalty the same for a first-time offender compared to a 4-time loser? The exact same amount of punishment to all violators is called a price list. I think it's almost discriminatory for the reasons mentioned. We had a cop assault his wife's lover. He was given a 30 day suspension. The police commissioner said, \"Maybe we can save him\". The boss was right. Our guy went learned from this case and went many more years without incident.",

I can't condone it but, I think I can understand why they did it but, like I say, it was wrong... Instead of firing these officers, they should have been sent through counseling, for what they went through and given some serious time off without pay but firing, I still don't know... IMHO...

        "content": "scpd3045, thanks for your dedicated service. It is recognized that the vast majority of LEOs are decent, good and dedicated folks who are doing a very tough job that is often thankless. However, the public trust is NOT to be trifled with nor ignored. It is the solid and required, substantial foundation upon which respect and granted authority ride. Without it, there would be mayhem and much worse. That is why the punishments for such violations of the public trust, like perjury by sworn officers, and ANY official misconduct, must be substantial enough to seriously and effectively deter any and all such offenses, rather than tacitly rewarding their occurrences due to the weakness and lightness of the punitive actions against the offenders. That's the balancing act we have to deal with. I often think of Serpico and the 'lion's den' he was faced with in the NYPD. That takes real courage, and a lot is at stake, including the life of any who pierce the \"Blue Wall of Silence\" for any or whatever reason(s). The public counts on us to do the RIGHT thing. We must always endeavor to do just that, even if it is difficult, or we fail from time to time. Honest failure TEACHES us...dishonest deeds and criminal acts only harm and diminish us and society in general.",
