Unlike some normal crackpot Frank happens to be an elected official that can introduce legislation. He has political power to do it and whether or not it would pass depends on other elected officials. Brushing off an assault on Capitalism by Mr. Frank (an elected official in Congress) by playing it off as not a big deal is kinda lame don't you think?",

I disagree! If they don't take TARP money we have nothing to say about their compensation. If they do take the money...we own their azzes and their management can dance to our tune until they repay the American taxpayers. Actually if they have legally binding contracts the Government can stfu and deal with it. We shouldn't have bailed out these retards and their companies in the first place.",
