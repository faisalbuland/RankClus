If you are going to blame every negative indicator in the market on Obama then you should be willing to give him credit when there are positive signs as well. The other side just can't do that BPCR. I have yet to see any of the anti-Obama folks acknowledge anything positive that President Obama has done. I think that they think, if they were to acknowledge something positive, it would make them look weak, or to look like appeasement. There is just something in the psyche of the \"Right,\" that has always taken on the persona of John Wayne tough guy--everyone else be damned. No one starts a war--or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so--without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.
