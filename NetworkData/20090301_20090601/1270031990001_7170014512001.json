Theater major, Technical field,, Ok , well hun, that pretty much means I do everything but dont getup and actor or dance on stage. More managerial, however I do have a side business while in school designing and construction of costumes. And no not the cheapo ones either. Also making wedding dresses and well you name it, I love working in theater but I can work with pretty much anyone as in a Music group, touring, Disney, or Theater. I will go where the job is and the money. By the time I am done, I will have sound engineering under my belt, lighting, I have already worked at stage design and construction as well as stage makeup, design and construct costuming at SUU. Along with my Cosmetolgy(hair styling, Nails, Pedicures etc)past, I keep my art going. However this work allows me to be able to stand or sit when I need to. Back to the Pagan/Wiccan thing: Well ppl dont understand is that paganism has been around longer then christianity. I considered myself a christian but yet I didn't feel right calling myself that. I had a my minister tell e when I was young, tapping me on my chest and knowing I had been going to several dif churches in a week for a couple years. he stated \"it doesnt matter what church you go to, because your church is within yourself\". However he then learned I had some issues with the book itself. Not that I dont follow the golden rule and the 10 commandments, But I always had an odd gift and my mom tried to pressure it out of me and later I found she hated me for this gift. I can't control it nor can I make it happen when ppl request it. It just does. YOu tell me what your mom would think of you when you about 3 nand your fighting with someone that is not there yet when she told me to stop , I let go of the toy after telling her this girl refused to let me have it and then my mom saw that tow float as if you were putting a toy babydoll in your arms. After that, I was put through grief , hearing test and eye test galour. But once I saw the movie Sixth Sense, I saw me. Because of this, My brothers were very abusive making me out to be a freak. Took many years to get close to ppl in general. Then I found I had other gifts, once I moved out. If I am very close to you personally, I can feel illness coming on, when their mom is sick , just odd things. I found I can change outcomes of stuff a tad by my own hand. But this took a bit of learning. Now I am still considered a student of the art of that. No, it still doesnt make me a witch just because I can see ghosts and talk to them, have premenitions, and so on. It just happens and I cna't figure out when and why. The lst was a crush I had on a guyin JRHS and HS. and woke and he ws the first person that came to mind, Not 2 weeks later, the plane he was on almost collided with another due to air traffic controller mistake, Ripped the wing half off in Vegas. And he is a Minister with a large Perish in Mo. Ever since, HE believes, And now can't wait to see me. Yeah he is married, with Kids, But its still nice to see someone I knew and liked alot. plus due to my family abuse, I was very shy. And if my mom found out he was hispanic, I would have had my head taken right off. She claimed she was never prejudice yet she was big time, Only time not was when she sold them drugs. Now you know why I moved out. Emmancipated at 15. It took me time but I found out what I was when I met my 2nd husband. ANyhow, You are totally welcome to IM me in yahoo, I go by Angelbabz. I dont mind discussing anything with anyone",

I was a military spouse almost 15 yrs and my ex retired .Navy reserve/active Navy/Army. And he was Wiccan. Just look at some of us like well of the Love and Light. The 5 pointed star is multiple meanings now. For the new Wiccans, Like the Cross with 4 additions small crosses around it. meant all the points of Jesus wounds , well the new Wiccan have also not only kept their original belief but also believe that jesus existed. We have a Higher Light such as the Indians, I am Cherokee as well 1/4. My great great grandpa was a shamen or was there another great in there. lol. I have to look back at my geneology. But I would say I am more eclectic? since I have many sides to me, I dont read cards or ruins, I can read ppl though. Feel their pains and so on, PPl think its intuitive but it all comes together. My grandma that was full cherokee saw that in me and tried her hardest to gte custody of me when she saw all the abuse, me being the only girl of 6. But they felt she was to old. Plus I could not understand a word she said, Cherokee are known for chewing fresh tobacco leaves while on the res. and she did and had a big chunk of her tongue removed when I was little due to cancer. But my dad was able to really to me what she would say, she just bit her tongue alot plus she spoke english and her native tongue and he understood it but never taught me. Then she passed on as soon as i was old enough to get family history. But the indians like the pagans/Wiccans were around alot longer then BC. But if anyone wishes to fins an issue, feel free to do so. There are more Wiccan/pagans in the US that call themselves Christian to hide the real side of them. And no we dont drink Blood. and you look back at all the major holiday's, they are Pagan. . If you wish to talk, I left my yahoo name on the other discussion with Bill. I look well educated discussions. And not talking to ignorance but open minded ppl. UNless your not openminded....",
