And don\u2019t get me started on about 95% of the useless trash sitting in the House and Senate. All the talk about protocol, after destroying protocol when Brown was at the White House and then the O's with the Q of E. Oh but then Proper Protocol is used as the defense with the K of S? Please, stop making excuses for the man. I doubt he can even spell protocol. (Maybe that is the reason for not releasing his grades, ashamed?)",

Search Daily Kos and take a looksie, ya wanna see hate, go there, oh and they just looooove soldiers there too. I was just as disgusted by that. The holding hands thing is cultural of Friends in the Middle East; the other touchy feely stuff was creepy. Don\u2019t make the assumption that people pointing out The Messiahs ineptitude supported Bush, as far as I\u2019m concerned we haven\u2019t had a good President since Lincoln. And don\u2019t get me started on about 95% of the useless trash sitting in the House and Senate. All the talk about protocol, after destroying protocol when Brown was at the White House and then the O's with the Q of E. Oh but then Proper Protocol is used as the defense with the K of S? Please, stop making excuses for the man. I doubt he can even spell protocol. (Maybe that is the reason for not releasing his grades, ashamed?)",

Dave No one said anything about Bush? Ya might wanna put in the memory chip; he was attacked like crazy as being an Oil-Based-lapdog. Please. Search Daily Kos and take a looksie, ya wanna see hate, go there, oh and they just looooove soldiers there too. I was just as disgusted by that. The holding hands thing is cultural of Friends in the Middle East; the other touchy feely stuff was creepy. Don\u2019t make the assumption that people pointing out The Messiahs ineptitude supported Bush, as far as I\u2019m concerned we haven\u2019t had a good President since Lincoln. And don\u2019t get me started on about 95% of the useless trash sitting in the House and Senate. All the talk about protocol, after destroying protocol when Brown was at the White House and then the O's with the Q of E. Oh but then Proper Protocol is used as the defense with the K of S? Please, stop making excuses for the man. I doubt he can even spell protocol. (Maybe that is the reason for not releasing his grades, ashamed?)",
