To-day it's a statement about AIDS and condoms and the latter possibly making the former worse. This 'gaffe' has engendered a chorus of STFU's from the latex true-believers who think that, if everybody would just cover up, AIDS would fade to insignificance. For all their science, which only last year included a mass circumcision campaign, the rate of new AIDS infections continues at an unabated 15% per year. Given that deaths from AIDS have declined somewhat, this means that the AIDS 'viral load' in humanity as a whole, is on the increase. At the bottom of it all is the refusal to accept that AIDS is a terminal illness transmitted solely by human behaviour. A bandaid, or other prophylactic treatnment, is no more a guarantee of prevention than it is a cure. The Pope realizes what some of the world's best minds can't. If you can't change behaviour, you can't stop AIDS. Passing out the rubbers and encouraging people to be careful with their partnerS is a recipe for disaster. The Washingtom Post wanted to \"impeach the Pope\". Maybe they'd best start closer to home. >http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2009/03/impeach_the_pope.html >http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE52G6J620090317 This message has been edited.
