When I asked to register only didnt want anything at the time just wanted in the system in case I might need something down the road. I spent 25 years in and retired as a Msgt starting in the brown boot system in 1959, now that cover the big ones, Cuba,Berlin,Nam,and the list goes on. they said I had to many assets I went in at 17 and did have any assets and they sure dont pay enough to aquire anything to speak of. So I did good after I retired and that is the price to pay no benifits from the V.A. They did ask any vets if the MEANS system was good or not just the politicans protecting there ASSets not the vetrans. Lots of Luck to those that need it.",
