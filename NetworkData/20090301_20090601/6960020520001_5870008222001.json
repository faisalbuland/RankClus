Our leadership apparently has to make it unambiguously clear that any activities of this sort are forbidden as it compromises the mission (whether civilian or military). It is deeply unfortunate that the support for US efforts by the Afghani people has fallen so far.

        "content": "Great article Mr.Friedman!... In the last Administration it appears that ones participation in the pentagon prayer circle was a great career advancement tool.Heres an article from GQ magazine showing the source for much of the \"bible thumping\" in the military....oh yeah,did I mention its not al- jazeera either.This \"hindering\" Brandon Friedman talks about came all the way from the top. ON THE MORNING OF Thursday, April 10, 2003, Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s Pentagon prepared a top-secret briefing for George W. Bush. This document, known as the Worldwide Intelligence Update, was a daily digest of critical military intelligence so classified that it circulated among only a handful of Pentagon leaders and the president; Rumsfeld himself often delivered it, by hand, to the White House. The briefing\u2019s cover sheet generally featured triumphant, color images from the previous days\u2019 war efforts: On this particular morning, it showed the statue of Saddam Hussein being pulled down in Firdos Square, a grateful Iraqi child kissing an American soldier, and jubilant crowds thronging the streets of newly liberated Baghdad. And above these images, and just below the headline SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, was a quote that may have raised some eyebrows. It came from the Bible, from the book of Psalms: \u201cBehold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him\u2026To deliver their soul from death.\u201d This mixing of Crusades-like messaging with war imagery, which until now has not been revealed, had become routine. On March 31, a U.S. tank roared through the desert beneath a quote from Ephesians: \u201cTherefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.\u201d On April 7, Saddam Hussein struck a dictatorial pose, under this passage from the First Epistle of Peter: \u201cIt is God\u2019s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.\u201d These cover sheets were the brainchild of Major General Glen Shaffer, a director for intelligence serving both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretary of defense. In the days before the Iraq war, Shaffer\u2019s staff had created humorous covers in an attempt to alleviate the stress of preparing for battle. Then, as the body counting began, Shaffer, a Christian, deemed the biblical passages more suitable. Several others in the Pentagon disagreed. At least one Muslim analyst in the building had been greatly offended; others privately worried that if these covers were leaked during a war conducted in an Islamic nation, the fallout\u2014as one Pentagon staffer would later say\u2014\u201cwould be as bad as Abu Ghraib.\u201d But the Pentagon\u2019s top officials were apparently unconcerned about the effect such a disclosure might have on the conduct of the war or on Bush\u2019s public standing. When colleagues complained to Shaffer that including a religious message with an intelligence briefing seemed inappropriate, Shaffer politely informed them that the practice would continue, because \u201cmy seniors\u201d\u2014JCS chairman Richard Myers, Rumsfeld, and the commander in chief himself\u2014appreciated the cover pages.http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_9217",

This document, known as the Worldwide Intelligence Update, was a daily digest of critical military intelligence so classified that it circulated among only a handful of Pentagon leaders and the president; Rumsfeld himself often delivered it, by hand, to the White House. The briefing\u2019s cover sheet generally featured triumphant, color images from the previous days\u2019 war efforts: On this particular morning, it showed the statue of Saddam Hussein being pulled down in Firdos Square, a grateful Iraqi child kissing an American soldier, and jubilant crowds thronging the streets of newly liberated Baghdad. And above these images, and just below the headline SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, was a quote that may have raised some eyebrows. It came from the Bible, from the book of Psalms: \u201cBehold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him\u2026To deliver their soul from death.\u201d This mixing of Crusades-like messaging with war imagery, which until now has not been revealed, had become routine. On March 31, a U.S. tank roared through the desert beneath a quote from Ephesians: \u201cTherefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.\u201d On April 7, Saddam Hussein struck a dictatorial pose, under this passage from the First Epistle of Peter: \u201cIt is God\u2019s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.\u201d These cover sheets were the brainchild of Major General Glen Shaffer, a director for intelligence serving both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretary of defense. In the days before the Iraq war, Shaffer\u2019s staff had created humorous covers in an attempt to alleviate the stress of preparing for battle. Then, as the body counting began, Shaffer, a Christian, deemed the biblical passages more suitable. Several others in the Pentagon disagreed. At least one Muslim analyst in the building had been greatly offended; others privately worried that if these covers were leaked during a war conducted in an Islamic nation, the fallout\u2014as one Pentagon staffer would later say\u2014\u201cwould be as bad as Abu Ghraib.\u201d But the Pentagon\u2019s top officials were apparently unconcerned about the effect such a disclosure might have on the conduct of the war or on Bush\u2019s public standing. When colleagues complained to Shaffer that including a religious message with an intelligence briefing seemed inappropriate, Shaffer politely informed them that the practice would continue, because \u201cmy seniors\u201d\u2014JCS chairman Richard Myers, Rumsfeld, and the commander in chief himself\u2014appreciated the cover pages.http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_9217",

They would certainly appreciate the gift of an entire Bible that they could read daily. There are Christian missionaries operating in Afghanistan today in aid and education roles. They are not proselytizing, but Afghans are coming to ask about Christ through their efforts. I'm most concerned about the military apparently seizing and destroying a soldier's personal property, without due process. This seizure and destruction, if it occurred as implied in various articles, is a violation of the UCMJ. If distribution of literature is proselytizing, then we have another issue. Korans in English have been made available through the chaplains corps by muslims. Does that constitute proselytizing? If the soldier simply made a gift of the Bibles to an Afghan christian or a non-Afghan missionary, then general order 1 would be adhered to and everyone's constitutional rights would have been preserved.",
