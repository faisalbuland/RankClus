I suggest you have the same problem. The section of the article that talks about the F-14 parts is called \"context\". The article was placing the problem of weapons smuggling to Mexico in the larger context of a general weakness in US export controls to the rest of the world. Night Vision Devices being used are indeed a Bad trend but I can Legally buy such devices now, both in this country and around the globe. I'm sure that makes law enforcement here and in Mexico feel better. Where do you think Mexico gets theirs? The US is not the only Producer of Night Vision Devices. Companies all over the world produce such items. France Produced and sold to Iraq Night Vision (IR Passive 2nd Generation) RPG-7 Sights and shipped them to Saddam in 2002. Which does not relieve us of the responsibility to control the export of our own hardware, or stop funding the cartels with with our money. You added no facts, just hot air.",

Look, I don't deny that the U.S. has a role, if some of our \"citizens\" didn't abuse drugs and if the government didn't make the use of marijuana illegal in 1937, with the \"catch 22\" marijuana tax stamp act, we wouldn't be facing a large portion of this problem today... Criminals will take advantage of anything that they can, smuggling, i.e. drugs and people one way and stolen black market arms the other... The point is, the Mexican government has been so corrupt for so long, that the citizens of Mexico, no not all of them, are trying to get ahead in a corrupt society, THAT IS THEIR PROBLEM AND NOT OURS!... Does the criminal element in Mexico AND the U.S. take advantage of this?... YES, ABSOLUTELY!... The point is, some wish to punish the innocent, i.e. American firearms owners, to get the guilty... Those that propose such lunacy, ignore the simplest of all solutions, END THE PROHIBITION IMPOSED ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN 1937 DUE TO RACISM, LEGALIZE, TAX AND REGULATE MARIJUANA!... Do I like the idea?... NOT ONLY NO BUT, H3LL NO!... However, we are left with no choice, other than to loose the potential tax revenue, in the time of a depression and to deprive the criminals of one of their most lucrative sources of income... REMOVE THE PROFIT, REMOVE THE CRIMINAL!... This nation has two \"gateway\" drugs, that are perfectly legal, alcohol and tobacco... When I worked for NIS, yes, that's NIS, that's what it was called years ago, not NCIS, those that were busted for marijuana and other illicit drug usage, not a one of them did not either smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol, except for one young man who didn't smoke, he did drink, because he said that smoking cigarettes was bad for his health, go figure... My point to all of this is, we need to start acting smarter than the criminals, beat them at their own game, remove one of the major sources of income and crack down on another major source of income, illegal smuggling of aliens across our borders, that's all of them, north, south, east and west, land, sea and air borders... Punish the guilty, leave the innocent alone and for heavens sake, don't give up our civil rights to seek a punishment of the criminal... How many millions are spent to prosecute and house men and women, who's crime it was, to get caught, on more than one occasion, with marijuana for their own personal use... I'm not talking about those that sought to sell or distribute but, personal possession for their use or those that had a legitimate doctors prescription for the use of medical marijuana, legal on the state but not the federal level... Also, not just the ban on marijuana but a ban on the use of hemp products, an industry that once used to be a major tax and revenue producer... Even during WW-II, the federal government gave an exemption to the hemp industry, to produce lines and ropes for the U.S. military... In a time when we are hurting for jobs and tax revenue, to ban an entire industry on a 1937 racist drug ban, is asinine!... IMHO... Respectfully, SUNLINER81",
