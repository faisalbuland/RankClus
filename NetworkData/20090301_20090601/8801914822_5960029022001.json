Admiral Wu Shengli said the Communist Party leadership had ordered the navy to upgrade preparedness to defend the nation's expanding interests, Chinese newspapers reported on Thursday. (...) \"We must accelerate progress in developing key weapons equipment,\" Wu added, singling out big warships, long-distance stealth submarines, supersonic jet fighters, and high-accuracy long-range missiles. Chinese media have highlighted the government's hopes to build an aircraft carrier, seen as the badge of a mature ocean-going power. But Wu's remarks highlighted the country's broader ambitions to expand its naval reach. China's navy had become an \"ocean-going iron Great Wall\" to \"counter a range of security threats,\" Wu said. (...) Wu, a member of the Central Military Commission, which steers China's military forces, said the People's Liberation Army Navy was becoming more adept at long-distance operations. Chinese military plans have long centered on Taiwan, the self-ruled island close to the mainland coast that Beijing says must accept eventual reunification, by force if necessary. But with China's appetite for energy and resources increasingly dependent on distant sources, strategists have called for a navy that can protect the nation's interests in distant seas. \"Training on high seas has become the norm,\" Wu said. But the PLA navy has a long way to go before it approaches U.S. naval power. China has about 290,000 navy personnel, many working on aged vessels. And even with new technology, China has some way to catch up in mastering joint operations.",
