This in turn led to ecvacuation of border security personnel 'for their personal safety' after no agreement was reached in talks last night. The Akwasasne reserve straddles the Ontario, Quebec and US borders with those two provinces. So to-day the Canadian side of border security in that area might well be in the hands of the Iroquois Warriors many of whom have received military training in the US armed forces.",
