Great book, dragonflyer, but it kind of dates us! If I'm not mistaken, the biggest bible quoters in the New Testament are the Pharisees (fanatics) and I don't believe they won much support from Jesus! And apparently all the bible quoting on the briefings, etc. went basically ignored or was infective. But then that probably wasn't its purpose. God talk is normal for politicians. It means nothing. But it is offensive of you don't believe it or believe it is misused, which it is.",

Chicken or egg. They BOTH react to each other and NEITHER should be in control. For the last decade or so the extreme right has had a lot more power than it should and things are swinging away from them, hopefully it will NOT swing to far left. This message has been edited.
