Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

To put this \"issue\" in perspective, let's take a look at the question in the context of the other questions that were asked.

I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place.

She lost every event. The question didn't help her, but it apparently didn't keep her from being first runner-up, either, so I'm not sure what she's *****ing about. Her competitor scored in first place in every event. The little girl in question scored no higher than second in any one event, and scored in third in one.",

To put this \"issue\" in perspective, let's take a look at the question in the context of the other questions that were asked. First, the questioners were chosen by random lottery, with one of the judges not being allowed to ask a question at all. I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

        "reply": "I said earlier that the question was unfair. I now retract that. To put this \"issue\" in perspective, let's take a look at the question in the context of the other questions that were asked. First, the questioners were chosen by random lottery, with one of the judges not being allowed to ask a question at all. I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place.

To put this \"issue\" in perspective, let's take a look at the question in the context of the other questions that were asked. First, the questioners were chosen by random lottery, with one of the judges not being allowed to ask a question at all. I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place.

Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place.

To put this \"issue\" in perspective, let's take a look at the question in the context of the other questions that were asked.

I fully expect that windbag Perez Hilton fully intended to ask ANY contestant this question, so it was not unfair to any specific contestant. Second, let's take a look at these questions. Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others? Besides, as I've pointed out numerous times now, she was well behind the winner even before the question/answer, and still managed to wind up in second place. She's a sore loser, plain and simple, and as such, undeserving of the tiara.",

Question 1: Do you believe that taxpayer money should be used to bail out struggling US companies? Why or why not? Question 2: Do you think the US should have universal health care as a right of citizenship? Why or why not? (That girl's answer was awful, btw.) Question 3: Hillary Clinton announced last month that the US government was pledging $40 million to help Afghans hold elections in their country. With our country in recession, is this the right thing to do? Question 4: Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think that every state should follow suit? Why of why not? Question 5: Recently the alleged domestic violence situation involving Chris Brown and Rihanna carried a lot of headlines, and people across America had many questions. As Miss USA, would you have spoken out; and if so, what would you have said? How is question 4 any more loaded or political than any of the others?

She dared complain. POS huh. Yeh, I know. Would you feel that way if she complained about a question that didnt hit your home? How dare she complain about a stupid questioned ask. She lost every event. The question didn't help her, but it apparently didn't keep her from being first runner-up, either, so I'm not sure what she's *****ing about. Her competitor scored in first place in every event. The little girl in question scored no higher than second in any one event, and scored in third in one.",
