I screwed up some too on military.com, quite a few times, especially when I first came on the boards, but also as recently as today, ask the Marine MODs Even paid one discretion with a 6 month suspension. I hope you will reconsider. I'd appreciate it. I need someone to play the word games with. 2nd post I got off suspension July 2007 and would like to think I learned my lesson. I still screw up and when I do, I will always apologize. I am no better than anyone else. I have always had the personality that rubs people the wrong way. I guess you could say I am strong willed. This site is like home to me. I can't tell you how many times members here have comforted me, got on me when I fooked up, and turned my sheety day into a good one. The Marines on the MODF taught me alot and have made me a better person, I am grateful and apprecative of that, I hope to find the same on the General Discussions forum Bergy, if you leave, I'm gonna fook up. Help me, bro. I only meet Bergy a few days now.... Since then he has already comforted me, in a \"manlove way\" , one vet to another. He has taught me some too already. I can tell he is a good man and veteran. He has been a good friend to many of you. In our short friendship, he has extended a hand, not always lovinglee, but he extended it, and I knew it was real. Well, I could go... I'll finish my experience by saying \"Whatever decision you make, I'm 100% covering your 6, and I hope I have the opportunity to get to know you better.\" Man, I enjoyed your company. Salute I admit, I got the eye sweat. Damn I hate when that happens",
