(....) Within the Chinese intelligentsia there is a deep divide over how to handle North Korea. The Global Times, a newspaper with close party ties, Tuesday published a survey of 20 of the country's top foreign policy experts. It found them split down the middle -- 10 arguing for tough sanctions against North Korea, 10 opposed. \"Traditionally, China has been very friendly to North Korea, but now there is a feeling that the North Koreans are causing us too much trouble,\" Zhang said.

The NK folks are just playing according to well established Soviet Rules of Engagement. Scream, yell, holler and rattle whatever weapon you happen to possess. Scare the Capiltalists, then wait for the food trucks to pacify... Folks, NK leaders know full well, if there is a SERIOUS attempt to load a nuk on one the oft times missfired missles NK has, the launch pad will dissolve in smoke. A 20 k altitude Boeing Predator with a Hell Fire can do enough damage to a launch pad to set back thier efforts by years. Not possible? Ask the Taliban leaders who sat down to lunch and never got up. end",

GW Bush, and recent SK and Japanese leadership, have broken the cycle of throwing the Norks an appeasement cookie every time they rattle their saber. Plus, China does have a ton of leverage (they are just about single-handedly supporting what little economy the norks do have), and the LAST thing they (and Russia, point of fact) want is millions of refugees streaming over their border. NOBODY will tolerate the norks starting a shooting war, much less flinging a handful of nukes at their neighbors. Even the possible thrreat of the norks selling a nuke to AQ or to Iran to give to AQ...it's a nuke, not a homemade zipgun. Let's say a nork nuke does get put on the black market and then set off in NYC. It WILL get traced back to the country of origin, who WILL get treated just as if they had launched it themselves. Why haven't any of those missing nukes from the USSR been aquired by a terrorist group and then set off in NYC or Tel Aviv? I'll tell you why: because the Kremlin knows we would hold them responsible. When it all comes down to it, China will rein them in. China wants to be the regional superpower. They want their economy to keep rolling at 9%, which won't happen if the norks start a shooting war.",
