September 11, 2006 a memorial to 9-11 and those who died there was unveiled in Bayonne NJ. The memorial called, The Tear Drop Memorial\" was donated by Russia. Bayonne is a little piece of nothing in NJ but from there The Statue Of Liberty is perfectly focused in the tear drop. It's a most beautiful monument. What's hard to understand is why it received no press and is still basically unknown? Anyway here it is. \"http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/r/russian-911-memorial.htm\" As one can see from the URL, some even doubt it's existence. How come I pressed \"One for English\" and still can't understand a word the dude is saying?",
