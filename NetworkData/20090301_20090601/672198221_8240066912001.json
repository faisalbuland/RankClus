By William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott Thursday, April 02, 2009 You've heard this shocking \"fact\" before -- on TV and radio, in newspapers, on the Internet and from the highest politicians in the land: 90 percent of the weapons used to commit crimes in Mexico come from the United States. -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it to reporters on a flight to Mexico City. [[One wonders, did she hold one when the snipers shot at her in East Europe?]] -- CBS newsman Bob Schieffer referred to it while interviewing President Obama. -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein [[now there's a reliable source!]] said at a Senate hearing: \"It is unacceptable to have 90 percent of the guns that are picked up in Mexico and used to shoot judges, police officers and mayors ... come from the United States.\" -- William Hoover, assistant director for field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified in the House of Representatives that \"there is more than enough evidence to indicate that over 90 percent of the firearms that have either been recovered in, or interdicted in transport to Mexico, originated from various sources within the United States.\" [[If the true threat of illegal activities involving firearms in or from the US drops, so does his budget.]] There's just one problem with the 90 percent \"statistic\" and it's a big one: It's just not true. In fact, it's not even close. The fact is, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the U.S. What's true, an ATF spokeswoman told FOXNews.com, in a clarification of the statistic used by her own agency's assistant director, \"is that over 90 percent of the traced firearms originate from the U.S.\" But a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S. \"Not every weapon seized in Mexico has a serial number on it that would make it traceable, and the U.S. effort to trace weapons really only extends to weapons that have been in the U.S. market,\" Matt Allen, special agent of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told FOX News. -------------------------------- Again, the leftists, the fear-mongering, Constitution abhoring collectivists cannot stand the idea of common, good folks of the US being armed, as our Forefathers knew was ESSENTIAL if the guvmint was not to become casually tyrranical against those common citizens.

By William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott Thursday, April 02, 2009 You've heard this shocking \"fact\" before -- on TV and radio, in newspapers, on the Internet and from the highest politicians in the land: 90 percent of the weapons used to commit crimes in Mexico come from the United States. -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it to reporters on a flight to Mexico City. [[One wonders, did she hold one when the snipers shot at her in East Europe?]] -- CBS newsman Bob Schieffer referred to it while interviewing President Obama. -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein [[now there's a reliable source!]] said at a Senate hearing: \"It is unacceptable to have 90 percent of the guns that are picked up in Mexico and used to shoot judges, police officers and mayors ... come from the United States.\" -- William Hoover, assistant director for field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified in the House of Representatives that \"there is more than enough evidence to indicate that over 90 percent of the firearms that have either been recovered in, or interdicted in transport to Mexico, originated from various sources within the United States.\" [[If the true threat of illegal activities involving firearms in or from the US drops, so does his budget.]] There's just one problem with the 90 percent \"statistic\" and it's a big one: It's just not true. In fact, it's not even close.

By William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott Thursday, April 02, 2009 You've heard this shocking \"fact\" before -- on TV and radio, in newspapers, on the Internet and from the highest politicians in the land: 90 percent of the weapons used to commit crimes in Mexico come from the United States. -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it to reporters on a flight to Mexico City. [[One wonders, did she hold one when the snipers shot at her in East Europe?]] -- CBS newsman Bob Schieffer referred to it while interviewing President Obama. -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein [[now there's a reliable source!]] said at a Senate hearing: \"It is unacceptable to have 90 percent of the guns that are picked up in Mexico and used to shoot judges, police officers and mayors ... come from the United States.\" -- William Hoover, assistant director for field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified in the House of Representatives that \"there is more than enough evidence to indicate that over 90 percent of the firearms that have either been recovered in, or interdicted in transport to Mexico, originated from various sources within the United States.\" [[If the true threat of illegal activities involving firearms in or from the US drops, so does his budget.]] There's just one problem with the 90 percent \"statistic\" and it's a big one: It's just not true. In fact, it's not even close. The fact is, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the U.S. What's true, an ATF spokeswoman told FOXNews.com, in a clarification of the statistic used by her own agency's assistant director, \"is that over 90 percent of the traced firearms originate from the U.S.\" But a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S. \"Not every weapon seized in Mexico has a serial number on it that would make it traceable, and the U.S. effort to trace weapons really only extends to weapons that have been in the U.S. market,\" Matt Allen, special agent of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told FOX News. -------------------------------- Again, the leftists, the fear-mongering, Constitution abhoring collectivists cannot stand the idea of common, good folks of the US being armed, as our Forefathers knew was ESSENTIAL if the guvmint was not to become casually tyrranical against those common citizens.

By William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott Thursday, April 02, 2009 You've heard this shocking \"fact\" before -- on TV and radio, in newspapers, on the Internet and from the highest politicians in the land: 90 percent of the weapons used to commit crimes in Mexico come from the United States. -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it to reporters on a flight to Mexico City. [[One wonders, did she hold one when the snipers shot at her in East Europe?]] -- CBS newsman Bob Schieffer referred to it while interviewing President Obama. -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein [[now there's a reliable source!]] said at a Senate hearing: \"It is unacceptable to have 90 percent of the guns that are picked up in Mexico and used to shoot judges, police officers and mayors ... come from the United States.\" -- William Hoover, assistant director for field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified in the House of Representatives that \"there is more than enough evidence to indicate that over 90 percent of the firearms that have either been recovered in, or interdicted in transport to Mexico, originated from various sources within the United States.\" [[If the true threat of illegal activities involving firearms in or from the US drops, so does his budget.]] There's just one problem with the 90 percent \"statistic\" and it's a big one: It's just not true. In fact, it's not even close.

By William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott Thursday, April 02, 2009 You've heard this shocking \"fact\" before -- on TV and radio, in newspapers, on the Internet and from the highest politicians in the land: 90 percent of the weapons used to commit crimes in Mexico come from the United States. -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it to reporters on a flight to Mexico City. [[One wonders, did she hold one when the snipers shot at her in East Europe?]] -- CBS newsman Bob Schieffer referred to it while interviewing President Obama. -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein [[now there's a reliable source!]] said at a Senate hearing: \"It is unacceptable to have 90 percent of the guns that are picked up in Mexico and used to shoot judges, police officers and mayors ... come from the United States.\" -- William Hoover, assistant director for field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified in the House of Representatives that \"there is more than enough evidence to indicate that over 90 percent of the firearms that have either been recovered in, or interdicted in transport to Mexico, originated from various sources within the United States.\" [[If the true threat of illegal activities involving firearms in or from the US drops, so does his budget.]] There's just one problem with the 90 percent \"statistic\" and it's a big one: It's just not true. In fact, it's not even close. The fact is, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the U.S. What's true, an ATF spokeswoman told FOXNews.com, in a clarification of the statistic used by her own agency's assistant director, \"is that over 90 percent of the traced firearms originate from the U.S.\" But a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S. \"Not every weapon seized in Mexico has a serial number on it that would make it traceable, and the U.S. effort to trace weapons really only extends to weapons that have been in the U.S. market,\" Matt Allen, special agent of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told FOX News. -------------------------------- Again, the leftists, the fear-mongering, Constitution abhoring collectivists cannot stand the idea of common, good folks of the US being armed, as our Forefathers knew was ESSENTIAL if the guvmint was not to become casually tyrranical against those common citizens.

By William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott Thursday, April 02, 2009 You've heard this shocking \"fact\" before -- on TV and radio, in newspapers, on the Internet and from the highest politicians in the land: 90 percent of the weapons used to commit crimes in Mexico come from the United States. -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it to reporters on a flight to Mexico City. [[One wonders, did she hold one when the snipers shot at her in East Europe?]] -- CBS newsman Bob Schieffer referred to it while interviewing President Obama. -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein [[now there's a reliable source!]] said at a Senate hearing: \"It is unacceptable to have 90 percent of the guns that are picked up in Mexico and used to shoot judges, police officers and mayors ... come from the United States.\" -- William Hoover, assistant director for field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified in the House of Representatives that \"there is more than enough evidence to indicate that over 90 percent of the firearms that have either been recovered in, or interdicted in transport to Mexico, originated from various sources within the United States.\" [[If the true threat of illegal activities involving firearms in or from the US drops, so does his budget.]] There's just one problem with the 90 percent \"statistic\" and it's a big one: It's just not true. In fact, it's not even close.
