With Powell having voted for Obama, an his age (shouldn't be a factor but sometimes it is) I just don't see him in the race. Condie is single and doesn't have her own family, and Republicans always are looking toward \"family values.\" From what little I do know about Tim Pawlenty, he tends to shy away from mainsteam Republicanism, and perhaps that's why he's known as a good governor, because he always talks in the best interest of his state. I don't know his track record, but like Mr. Obama, he's got some excellent skills in verbiage, and must be doing something right for Minn. We'll see, should get interesting to say the least.

With Powell having voted for Obama, an his age (shouldn't be a factor but sometimes it is) I just don't see him in the race. Condie is single and doesn't have her own family, and Republicans always are looking toward \"family values.\" From what little I do know about Tim Pawlenty, he tends to shy away from mainsteam Republicanism, and perhaps that's why he's known as a good governor, because he always talks in the best interest of his state. I don't know his track record, but like Mr. Obama, he's got some excellent skills in verbiage, and must be doing something right for Minn. We'll see, should get interesting to say the least.
