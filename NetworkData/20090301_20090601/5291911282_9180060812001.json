I post this to this area of the forum, because my concern is about procedure, and the value (or lack thereof) of this web site. I am NOT posting about a particular person, though I have an example. That person's name is \"Barnes\", and when I posted in the \"find a Buddy\" part of the site, or when I post in the forum \"Navy Missing persons\", I am able to relate two entirely different sets of facts, and therein lies the rub. When I go to the non forum, dedicated \"Find A Buddy\" part of the site, I am asked information that really implies someone is looking in a local phone book, and has no idea about finding a military friend. When I searched for \"Barnes\" in the dedicated search part of the site, I was ONLY allowed to enter name and home state, the rest, rank and branch was essentially irrelevant, since it was nearly 20 years ago, and i don't have current info, or i would look in the phone book myself! So, like looking in a phone book, it returned just about all the Navy Barnes in S. Carolina. On the other hand, going to the forum, where finding someone is a matter of the pure luck that someone may know him, I was able to list the year I knew him (important), what ship he was on that year (a slam dunk), and what his job on the ship was. So if someone is using a military database, a \"Barnes\" on \"USS Halyburton, FFG40\", during desert storm, and afterward in 1992, where he was the radioman, should produce an IMMEDIATE hit. So why does the official search site not allow such information? With what I know, I should already be talking to the guy! I am in full recognition that once someone separates, he could be hard to find. But this system doesn't even let me ID him during his service, so i can start somewhere. So what gives? Where do I need to go to find all these guys dating from Vietnam up to the '90's. I suspect it's not here, and I don't mind paying, here or elsewhere, nor do I find the forum at fault in any other way. I think I will enjoy it here. For 12 years I served as a civilian, Governor Appointed, volunteer Commissioner and Chairman, and Executive Committee Member for USS Kidd, DD661, the fabulously restored WWII Historic Destroyer we have here in Baton Rouge. We were the number one place for destroyer reunions in the US at Historical Ships. But I guarantee that their membership officers knew something about finding people that I don't know, and that this site may not have. I only wish I had asked when I had the chance. But at the time, I was serving their needs, and I knew where \"Barnes\" was. So its my bad that I did not foresee the future better, and plan ahead. So I finish by asking if someone can give an old guy a helping hand. What the hell am I doing wrong? Thank you for your attention, and possible help, Arthur Colley, Captain USA, Vietnam period, Okinawa and Korea, CO, 30th Ord, GMGS. 1971. PS: Take my example. With that kind of specific data, it should be easy to close in on me, at least to my point of separation, which would include my home state, and many other clues to find me. But it seems not, or I could find Barnes (and some of the others that still live).",

Consequently, even if you had the opportunity to tailor your search to specifics, it probably wouldn't help.

If you have copies of old orders which include a lost brother's SSN, you can send a letter to the Social Security Administration asking them to pass on a message for you. If he/she is making SS payments, they'll have the current address and will usually forward a message on to them. The will NOT, however, reveal that address. VA will do the same thing, provided that the person has signed up for VA benefits. Of course, as with all things government, it may take a long while.",
