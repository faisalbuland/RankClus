I'm still getting screwed either way...

There can generally be mor eand more to go around, but only when wealth is created. Obamanation policies are inherently constraining. Oh, they'll tend to create greater equality of outcomes, but the shared misery and enforced mediocrity ensure that those who now have will keep on having; those who have less will be controlled by the freaks to keep on having less. Mrs. Obama's \"pie\" stays the same size, so hubby can have the ego trip and play the control games of determining who gets what.

Dave I'm a big supporter of SSI since thats the only thing between me and the poor house. Cost of living decreases. Is there such an animal? I've seen them fairly low in the dpast 8 years but decreasing the cost of living I think would be a new phenomenom. A couple of time we've seen the Eisenhower and 90% tax rate on taxable income quote as an arguement that under Republicans high taxes were alive and well. This is very misleading since you have to attain a plateau of earnings before the 90% kicks in. When reviewing the following please accept the fact General Ike kept the tax rate static while in office, while others drastically reduce the earnings claiming more of peoples money. I think you can match the year with the occupant of the White House. \"http://www.truthandpolitics.org/top-rates.php",

Or are you saying that if you invent or create a new industry or gadget, someone is going to \"take it away from you?\" So when Eisenhow was President and the top tax bracket was 90 percent, the rich were all poor? Eisenhower was a Commie? Man the story of Chicken Little is supposed to be an example of not exagerating reality - Anyone reading your post would think that an Amendment to the Constitution was just passed outlawing Free Enterprise.
