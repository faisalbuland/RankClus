It was, Penn told reporters during a phone conference Tuesday, a unique opportunity to engage in one of two lifelong passions. The first is acting; the second, public service. When Penn told his family and friends the news, some friends thought he was crazy to trade a successful actor's salary and fame for the tedium of government work. Penn has become a cult favorite for his role as half of a dope-smoking, hamburger-scarfing duo in the Harold and Kumar series and received critical acclaim in the lead role of Mira Nair's adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's bestseller The Namesake. He was going to leave Hollywood for a mid-level public servant's job? Really? His parents, he said, weren't so surprised. They had watched him deeply immerse himself in the Obama campaign and suspected he might make switch to politics at some point. Working at the Office of Public Liaison, Penn explained, would allow him to continue the work he had done as a member of candidate Obama's arts advisory council: reach out to Asian-American audiences, the arts community and young people. And he won't be a government drone forever: Penn said he intends to get back to acting at some point. A couple of years in D.C. might be the right prescription to cure him of Potomac Fever. And then, maybe we'll get Harold and Kumar Go To Washington. After all, he'll have done all the research. \"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102859368\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
