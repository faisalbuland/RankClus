That credit is under attack by the American Civil Liberties Union (aclu) along with our American Values, the Boy Scouts of America, and the public display of all other symbols of our American religious history and heritage. This became evident at the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial when the ACLU received $63,000 in its attack to remove the memorial that has been in place for over 75 years. The ACLU also attacked they Boy Scouts by filing lawsuits to kick them out of Portland and Chicago public Schools, and Balboa Park in San Diego receiving a total of over $1 million.

The American Legion and its 2.7 million members intend to fight against the ACLU or anyone else who would exploit the Civil Rights Act for profit. The attack by the ACLU on war memorials is an attack on the very freedoms that veterans fought and died to preserve. The ACLU is attacking those who have made tjhe ultimate sacrifice for our country. You are urged to become involved by contracting your representatives in Congress and ask them to support any bill proposed which would end this type of abuse.

        "content": "The ACLU Is Not Evil And neither are many people with whom we disagree. Stephen L. Carter I would like to say a word in defense of the American Civil Liberties Union. Christians\u2014including me, both in the pages of CT and elsewhere\u2014often criticize the ACLU for advocating separation of church and state in ways that seem less grounded in the Constitution and in history than in an ideological desire for a religion-free public arena. On the other hand, I shudder when fellow Christians blithely dismiss the organization as fundamentally biased against them. Some call it the Anti-Christian Liberals Union or the Anti-Christian Litigation Unit. There are other, less friendly acronyms as well. I think the ACLU is wrong to oppose religious expression in the public square, but being wrong is not the same as being evil. \u2022 More to the point, the ACLU is often right about the First Amendment's free exercise clause, taking on fights that others refuse. It might surprise some critics that the ACLU defends the free speech and free exercise rights of, well, Christians. For example, in 2001, the group interceded with a school district in Michigan that had deleted a high school senior's yearbook entry because she included a Bible verse. In 2002, the ACLU filed a brief on behalf of a pastor associated with Operation Rescue who was prevented from participating in a parade because his pro-life poster showed a photograph of an aborted baby. And last September, the organization joined a lawsuit on behalf of a New Jersey second-grader who was not allowed to sing \"Awesome God\" in a school talent show. (All of these examples are easily accessible on several Web pages now devoted to defending the ACLU 's record on Christianity.) Yet I must confess that, although I am pleased to balance the record, defending the ACLU is not my primary purpose here. I am more concerned about a habit of mind that seems to be growing among my fellow Christians, both political liberals and conservatives. That is, we seem to mimic the secular world's conflation of disagreement with wickedness, as if not sharing my worldview places my critic outside the realm of rational discourse. I spend most of my driving time nowadays listening to Christian radio. Most of what I hear is edifying and uplifting. But now and then a genuine clunker comes along, often in the form of a politically active Christian who derides anyone who disagrees with his version of biblical wisdom. One of the nastiest words, at least for many radio preachers, seems to be liberal. Now, I have often been described as a liberal myself\u2014although rarely by liberals. Once, after I gave a talk at a small Christian college in the Bible Belt, a concerned student carrying one of my books approached me. He had enjoyed the lecture, he assured me, but something in my book troubled him. He flipped to a page on which I had complimented something President Bill Clinton had said. The student then turned to me, the look of worry still on his face, and told me I must have written this because I was, really, a liberal. This student believed it was impossible for the good guys\u2014the way he said liberal told me that liberals were not among them\u2014to say anything positive about President Clinton. The host of a popular syndicated Christian radio program once told me that he had received death threats\u2014not just a few, but a lot\u2014during the Clinton administration. His sin? Reminding listeners of their obligation to pray for those God had placed in positions of authority, whether or not they happened to agree with their policies. Yes, we live in a polarized time. The screechy hatefulness emanating from many on the secular Left during the Bush administration has sullied our public discourse. Many Christians feel under assault by the uncompromising secularism of the culture. This includes the queries, on the heels of every bit of bad news, about how one can believe in a God who would allow certain things (this hurricane, this genocide, this war, this tsunami). As an antidote to these uninformed arguments, I recommend David Bentley Hart's startlingly exquisite 2005 book, The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami? As an antidote to the screechy hatefulness, I recommend Christian love. While our fallen nature makes all of us, whether on the Left or the Right, prone to hating our enemies, we Christians know that Christ calls us to a higher standard. Want a practical example? The next time a fellow Christian disparages the ACLU , try answering with something like this: \"Sure, they're on the wrong side sometimes, but I thank God for the times when they're right.\" This article first appeared in May 2006 issue of Christianity Today.

Thank you for posting a link to at least one case. Here are excerpts from the ACLU position on this matter. quote: \"Contrary to what some believe,\" said Peter Eliasberg, staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California and First Amendment specialist, \"it is not the role of the federal government to advance Christianity or any other sectarian belief. Americans are perfectly competent to make such decisions for themselves without government interference.\" \"The federal government,\" said Eliasberg, \"should not offer public land \u2013 owned collectively by people of every faith and of no faith \u2013 as a site for the advertisement and promotion of Jesus Christ, Buddha, Pope John Paul II, or any other particular religious figure.\" \"If anyone was allowed to place a permanent, free-standing expression of his or her religious or political viewpoint at this site,\" said Eliasberg, \"we would have no objection, but that is not the case. No other group is allowed to do that. This creates a situation in which the federal government favors Christian expression over any other.\" ************* Much of the controversy surrounding the cross concerned its status as a site where Christian veterans gather to remember war dead in special services. But not all veterans are in agreement about the cross. Morris Radin, an 82-year old Jewish veteran of World War II, spoke at the press conference to describe his experience of fighting for the principles he believes this country was founded on. \"My father, Abe, was just eighteen when he came to America and became an American citizen,\" said Radin. \"As an Orthodox Jew, he knew firsthand what happens when people are not free to practice their beliefs. He and my mother Sophie both left Russia to escape the pogroms. They never told me whether they had witnessed any of the atrocities born of that nation's inability to guarantee their freedom of religion. They drew a curtain on that period of their lives and faced a new life in a different place.\" \"They came to America without knowing the language,\" said Radin, \"but knowing the larger language of America's promise. America is big enough for everyone to practice his or her own faith and where no one faith is privileged over any other or over none at all. Abe and Sophie Radin loved this country as passionately and profoundly as any citizen.\" \"The country they loved is the country I fought for and love as well,\" said Radin, \"a country founded on principle, on freedom of conscience and religion, a country where the government isn't Christian or Jewish or Muslim, but can welcome all of these and more on a free and equal basis. That is the country I defend in supporting this legal action.\" \u201chttp://www.aclu-sc.org/releases/view/100354\u201d Dave",

A monument on private land, and private funds, is not the business of government to interfere with. As I said before if someone feels that the best way to honor veterans is to make a monument consisting of Spongebob Square Pants, that is their business. But when it's government land, then either let every religious belief have the right to put up a monument, or have no one put up a religious monument. One would think from Rays orginal post that the ACLU was attacking the Vietnam Memorial, 'cause they just hate America. But anyone can go to Washington and see and respect and be respected BY the Vietnam Memorial. If one goes to Arlington to respect the dead, as I have, I see crosses and every other symbol of religion or NO symbol of religion. Indeed, I've read that you can even see Wiccan symbols. But that's all inclusive. It is the families who choose how to remember their loved ones. No one, least of all the ACLU protests crosses at Arlington. Dave",

        "content": "The ACLU Is Not Evil And neither are many people with whom we disagree. Stephen L. Carter I would like to say a word in defense of the American Civil Liberties Union. Christians\u2014including me, both in the pages of CT and elsewhere\u2014often criticize the ACLU for advocating separation of church and state in ways that seem less grounded in the Constitution and in history than in an ideological desire for a religion-free public arena. On the other hand, I shudder when fellow Christians blithely dismiss the organization as fundamentally biased against them. Some call it the Anti-Christian Liberals Union or the Anti-Christian Litigation Unit. There are other, less friendly acronyms as well. I think the ACLU is wrong to oppose religious expression in the public square, but being wrong is not the same as being evil. \u2022 More to the point, the ACLU is often right about the First Amendment's free exercise clause, taking on fights that others refuse. It might surprise some critics that the ACLU defends the free speech and free exercise rights of, well, Christians. For example, in 2001, the group interceded with a school district in Michigan that had deleted a high school senior's yearbook entry because she included a Bible verse. In 2002, the ACLU filed a brief on behalf of a pastor associated with Operation Rescue who was prevented from participating in a parade because his pro-life poster showed a photograph of an aborted baby. And last September, the organization joined a lawsuit on behalf of a New Jersey second-grader who was not allowed to sing \"Awesome God\" in a school talent show. (All of these examples are easily accessible on several Web pages now devoted to defending the ACLU 's record on Christianity.) Yet I must confess that, although I am pleased to balance the record, defending the ACLU is not my primary purpose here. I am more concerned about a habit of mind that seems to be growing among my fellow Christians, both political liberals and conservatives. That is, we seem to mimic the secular world's conflation of disagreement with wickedness, as if not sharing my worldview places my critic outside the realm of rational discourse. I spend most of my driving time nowadays listening to Christian radio. Most of what I hear is edifying and uplifting. But now and then a genuine clunker comes along, often in the form of a politically active Christian who derides anyone who disagrees with his version of biblical wisdom. One of the nastiest words, at least for many radio preachers, seems to be liberal. Now, I have often been described as a liberal myself\u2014although rarely by liberals. Once, after I gave a talk at a small Christian college in the Bible Belt, a concerned student carrying one of my books approached me. He had enjoyed the lecture, he assured me, but something in my book troubled him. He flipped to a page on which I had complimented something President Bill Clinton had said. The student then turned to me, the look of worry still on his face, and told me I must have written this because I was, really, a liberal. This student believed it was impossible for the good guys\u2014the way he said liberal told me that liberals were not among them\u2014to say anything positive about President Clinton. The host of a popular syndicated Christian radio program once told me that he had received death threats\u2014not just a few, but a lot\u2014during the Clinton administration. His sin? Reminding listeners of their obligation to pray for those God had placed in positions of authority, whether or not they happened to agree with their policies. Yes, we live in a polarized time. The screechy hatefulness emanating from many on the secular Left during the Bush administration has sullied our public discourse. Many Christians feel under assault by the uncompromising secularism of the culture. This includes the queries, on the heels of every bit of bad news, about how one can believe in a God who would allow certain things (this hurricane, this genocide, this war, this tsunami). As an antidote to these uninformed arguments, I recommend David Bentley Hart's startlingly exquisite 2005 book, The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami? As an antidote to the screechy hatefulness, I recommend Christian love. While our fallen nature makes all of us, whether on the Left or the Right, prone to hating our enemies, we Christians know that Christ calls us to a higher standard. Want a practical example?

Thank you for posting a link to at least one case. Here are excerpts from the ACLU position on this matter. quote: \"Contrary to what some believe,\" said Peter Eliasberg, staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California and First Amendment specialist, \"it is not the role of the federal government to advance Christianity or any other sectarian belief. Americans are perfectly competent to make such decisions for themselves without government interference.\" \"The federal government,\" said Eliasberg, \"should not offer public land \u2013 owned collectively by people of every faith and of no faith \u2013 as a site for the advertisement and promotion of Jesus Christ, Buddha, Pope John Paul II, or any other particular religious figure.\" \"If anyone was allowed to place a permanent, free-standing expression of his or her religious or political viewpoint at this site,\" said Eliasberg, \"we would have no objection, but that is not the case. No other group is allowed to do that. This creates a situation in which the federal government favors Christian expression over any other.\" ************* Much of the controversy surrounding the cross concerned its status as a site where Christian veterans gather to remember war dead in special services. But not all veterans are in agreement about the cross. Morris Radin, an 82-year old Jewish veteran of World War II, spoke at the press conference to describe his experience of fighting for the principles he believes this country was founded on. \"My father, Abe, was just eighteen when he came to America and became an American citizen,\" said Radin. \"As an Orthodox Jew, he knew firsthand what happens when people are not free to practice their beliefs. He and my mother Sophie both left Russia to escape the pogroms. They never told me whether they had witnessed any of the atrocities born of that nation's inability to guarantee their freedom of religion. They drew a curtain on that period of their lives and faced a new life in a different place.\" \"They came to America without knowing the language,\" said Radin, \"but knowing the larger language of America's promise. America is big enough for everyone to practice his or her own faith and where no one faith is privileged over any other or over none at all. Abe and Sophie Radin loved this country as passionately and profoundly as any citizen.\" \"The country they loved is the country I fought for and love as well,\" said Radin, \"a country founded on principle, on freedom of conscience and religion, a country where the government isn't Christian or Jewish or Muslim, but can welcome all of these and more on a free and equal basis.

As I said before if someone feels that the best way to honor veterans is to make a monument consisting of Spongebob Square Pants, that is their business. But when it's government land, then either let every religious belief have the right to put up a monument, or have no one put up a religious monument. One would think from Rays orginal post that the ACLU was attacking the Vietnam Memorial, 'cause they just hate America. But anyone can go to Washington and see and respect and be respected BY the Vietnam Memorial. If one goes to Arlington to respect the dead, as I have, I see crosses and every other symbol of religion or NO symbol of religion. Indeed, I've read that you can even see Wiccan symbols. But that's all inclusive. It is the families who choose how to remember their loved ones. No one, least of all the ACLU protests crosses at Arlington. Dave",

        "content": "The ACLU Is Not Evil And neither are many people with whom we disagree. Stephen L. Carter I would like to say a word in defense of the American Civil Liberties Union. Christians\u2014including me, both in the pages of CT and elsewhere\u2014often criticize the ACLU for advocating separation of church and state in ways that seem less grounded in the Constitution and in history than in an ideological desire for a religion-free public arena. On the other hand, I shudder when fellow Christians blithely dismiss the organization as fundamentally biased against them. Some call it the Anti-Christian Liberals Union or the Anti-Christian Litigation Unit. There are other, less friendly acronyms as well. I think the ACLU is wrong to oppose religious expression in the public square, but being wrong is not the same as being evil. \u2022 More to the point, the ACLU is often right about the First Amendment's free exercise clause, taking on fights that others refuse. It might surprise some critics that the ACLU defends the free speech and free exercise rights of, well, Christians. For example, in 2001, the group interceded with a school district in Michigan that had deleted a high school senior's yearbook entry because she included a Bible verse. In 2002, the ACLU filed a brief on behalf of a pastor associated with Operation Rescue who was prevented from participating in a parade because his pro-life poster showed a photograph of an aborted baby. And last September, the organization joined a lawsuit on behalf of a New Jersey second-grader who was not allowed to sing \"Awesome God\" in a school talent show. (All of these examples are easily accessible on several Web pages now devoted to defending the ACLU 's record on Christianity.) Yet I must confess that, although I am pleased to balance the record, defending the ACLU is not my primary purpose here. I am more concerned about a habit of mind that seems to be growing among my fellow Christians, both political liberals and conservatives. That is, we seem to mimic the secular world's conflation of disagreement with wickedness, as if not sharing my worldview places my critic outside the realm of rational discourse. I spend most of my driving time nowadays listening to Christian radio. Most of what I hear is edifying and uplifting. But now and then a genuine clunker comes along, often in the form of a politically active Christian who derides anyone who disagrees with his version of biblical wisdom. One of the nastiest words, at least for many radio preachers, seems to be liberal. Now, I have often been described as a liberal myself\u2014although rarely by liberals. Once, after I gave a talk at a small Christian college in the Bible Belt, a concerned student carrying one of my books approached me. He had enjoyed the lecture, he assured me, but something in my book troubled him. He flipped to a page on which I had complimented something President Bill Clinton had said. The student then turned to me, the look of worry still on his face, and told me I must have written this because I was, really, a liberal. This student believed it was impossible for the good guys\u2014the way he said liberal told me that liberals were not among them\u2014to say anything positive about President Clinton. The host of a popular syndicated Christian radio program once told me that he had received death threats\u2014not just a few, but a lot\u2014during the Clinton administration. His sin? Reminding listeners of their obligation to pray for those God had placed in positions of authority, whether or not they happened to agree with their policies. Yes, we live in a polarized time. The screechy hatefulness emanating from many on the secular Left during the Bush administration has sullied our public discourse. Many Christians feel under assault by the uncompromising secularism of the culture. This includes the queries, on the heels of every bit of bad news, about how one can believe in a God who would allow certain things (this hurricane, this genocide, this war, this tsunami). As an antidote to these uninformed arguments, I recommend David Bentley Hart's startlingly exquisite 2005 book, The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami? As an antidote to the screechy hatefulness, I recommend Christian love. While our fallen nature makes all of us, whether on the Left or the Right, prone to hating our enemies, we Christians know that Christ calls us to a higher standard. Want a practical example? The next time a fellow Christian disparages the ACLU , try answering with something like this: \"Sure, they're on the wrong side sometimes, but I thank God for the times when they're right.\" This article first appeared in May 2006 issue of Christianity Today.

And last September, the organization joined a lawsuit on behalf of a New Jersey second-grader who was not allowed to sing \"Awesome God\" in a school talent show. (All of these examples are easily accessible on several Web pages now devoted to defending the ACLU 's record on Christianity.) Yet I must confess that, although I am pleased to balance the record, defending the ACLU is not my primary purpose here. I am more concerned about a habit of mind that seems to be growing among my fellow Christians, both political liberals and conservatives. That is, we seem to mimic the secular world's conflation of disagreement with wickedness, as if not sharing my worldview places my critic outside the realm of rational discourse. I spend most of my driving time nowadays listening to Christian radio. Most of what I hear is edifying and uplifting. But now and then a genuine clunker comes along, often in the form of a politically active Christian who derides anyone who disagrees with his version of biblical wisdom. One of the nastiest words, at least for many radio preachers, seems to be liberal. Now, I have often been described as a liberal myself\u2014although rarely by liberals. Once, after I gave a talk at a small Christian college in the Bible Belt, a concerned student carrying one of my books approached me. He had enjoyed the lecture, he assured me, but something in my book troubled him. He flipped to a page on which I had complimented something President Bill Clinton had said. The student then turned to me, the look of worry still on his face, and told me I must have written this because I was, really, a liberal. This student believed it was impossible for the good guys\u2014the way he said liberal told me that liberals were not among them\u2014to say anything positive about President Clinton. The host of a popular syndicated Christian radio program once told me that he had received death threats\u2014not just a few, but a lot\u2014during the Clinton administration. His sin? Reminding listeners of their obligation to pray for those God had placed in positions of authority, whether or not they happened to agree with their policies. Yes, we live in a polarized time. The screechy hatefulness emanating from many on the secular Left during the Bush administration has sullied our public discourse. Many Christians feel under assault by the uncompromising secularism of the culture. This includes the queries, on the heels of every bit of bad news, about how one can believe in a God who would allow certain things (this hurricane, this genocide, this war, this tsunami). As an antidote to these uninformed arguments, I recommend David Bentley Hart's startlingly exquisite 2005 book, The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami? As an antidote to the screechy hatefulness, I recommend Christian love. While our fallen nature makes all of us, whether on the Left or the Right, prone to hating our enemies, we Christians know that Christ calls us to a higher standard. Want a practical example? The next time a fellow Christian disparages the ACLU , try answering with something like this: \"Sure, they're on the wrong side sometimes, but I thank God for the times when they're right.\" This article first appeared in May 2006 issue of Christianity Today.

Thank you for posting a link to at least one case. Here are excerpts from the ACLU position on this matter. quote: \"Contrary to what some believe,\" said Peter Eliasberg, staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California and First Amendment specialist, \"it is not the role of the federal government to advance Christianity or any other sectarian belief. Americans are perfectly competent to make such decisions for themselves without government interference.\" \"The federal government,\" said Eliasberg, \"should not offer public land \u2013 owned collectively by people of every faith and of no faith \u2013 as a site for the advertisement and promotion of Jesus Christ, Buddha, Pope John Paul II, or any other particular religious figure.\" \"If anyone was allowed to place a permanent, free-standing expression of his or her religious or political viewpoint at this site,\" said Eliasberg, \"we would have no objection, but that is not the case. No other group is allowed to do that. This creates a situation in which the federal government favors Christian expression over any other.\" ************* Much of the controversy surrounding the cross concerned its status as a site where Christian veterans gather to remember war dead in special services. But not all veterans are in agreement about the cross. Morris Radin, an 82-year old Jewish veteran of World War II, spoke at the press conference to describe his experience of fighting for the principles he believes this country was founded on. \"My father, Abe, was just eighteen when he came to America and became an American citizen,\" said Radin. \"As an Orthodox Jew, he knew firsthand what happens when people are not free to practice their beliefs. He and my mother Sophie both left Russia to escape the pogroms. They never told me whether they had witnessed any of the atrocities born of that nation's inability to guarantee their freedom of religion. They drew a curtain on that period of their lives and faced a new life in a different place.\" \"They came to America without knowing the language,\" said Radin, \"but knowing the larger language of America's promise. America is big enough for everyone to practice his or her own faith and where no one faith is privileged over any other or over none at all. Abe and Sophie Radin loved this country as passionately and profoundly as any citizen.\" \"The country they loved is the country I fought for and love as well,\" said Radin, \"a country founded on principle, on freedom of conscience and religion, a country where the government isn't Christian or Jewish or Muslim, but can welcome all of these and more on a free and equal basis. That is the country I defend in supporting this legal action.\" \u201chttp://www.aclu-sc.org/releases/view/100354\u201d Dave",

Christians\u2014including me, both in the pages of CT and elsewhere\u2014often criticize the ACLU for advocating separation of church and state in ways that seem less grounded in the Constitution and in history than in an ideological desire for a religion-free public arena. On the other hand, I shudder when fellow Christians blithely dismiss the organization as fundamentally biased against them. Some call it the Anti-Christian Liberals Union or the Anti-Christian Litigation Unit. There are other, less friendly acronyms as well. I think the ACLU is wrong to oppose religious expression in the public square, but being wrong is not the same as being evil. \u2022 More to the point, the ACLU is often right about the First Amendment's free exercise clause, taking on fights that others refuse. It might surprise some critics that the ACLU defends the free speech and free exercise rights of, well, Christians. For example, in 2001, the group interceded with a school district in Michigan that had deleted a high school senior's yearbook entry because she included a Bible verse. In 2002, the ACLU filed a brief on behalf of a pastor associated with Operation Rescue who was prevented from participating in a parade because his pro-life poster showed a photograph of an aborted baby. And last September, the organization joined a lawsuit on behalf of a New Jersey second-grader who was not allowed to sing \"Awesome God\" in a school talent show. (All of these examples are easily accessible on several Web pages now devoted to defending the ACLU 's record on Christianity.) Yet I must confess that, although I am pleased to balance the record, defending the ACLU is not my primary purpose here. I am more concerned about a habit of mind that seems to be growing among my fellow Christians, both political liberals and conservatives. That is, we seem to mimic the secular world's conflation of disagreement with wickedness, as if not sharing my worldview places my critic outside the realm of rational discourse. I spend most of my driving time nowadays listening to Christian radio. Most of what I hear is edifying and uplifting. But now and then a genuine clunker comes along, often in the form of a politically active Christian who derides anyone who disagrees with his version of biblical wisdom. One of the nastiest words, at least for many radio preachers, seems to be liberal. Now, I have often been described as a liberal myself\u2014although rarely by liberals. Once, after I gave a talk at a small Christian college in the Bible Belt, a concerned student carrying one of my books approached me. He had enjoyed the lecture, he assured me, but something in my book troubled him. He flipped to a page on which I had complimented something President Bill Clinton had said. The student then turned to me, the look of worry still on his face, and told me I must have written this because I was, really, a liberal. This student believed it was impossible for the good guys\u2014the way he said liberal told me that liberals were not among them\u2014to say anything positive about President Clinton. The host of a popular syndicated Christian radio program once told me that he had received death threats\u2014not just a few, but a lot\u2014during the Clinton administration. His sin? Reminding listeners of their obligation to pray for those God had placed in positions of authority, whether or not they happened to agree with their policies. Yes, we live in a polarized time. The screechy hatefulness emanating from many on the secular Left during the Bush administration has sullied our public discourse. Many Christians feel under assault by the uncompromising secularism of the culture. This includes the queries, on the heels of every bit of bad news, about how one can believe in a God who would allow certain things (this hurricane, this genocide, this war, this tsunami). As an antidote to these uninformed arguments, I recommend David Bentley Hart's startlingly exquisite 2005 book, The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami? As an antidote to the screechy hatefulness, I recommend Christian love. While our fallen nature makes all of us, whether on the Left or the Right, prone to hating our enemies, we Christians know that Christ calls us to a higher standard. Want a practical example? The next time a fellow Christian disparages the ACLU , try answering with something like this: \"Sure, they're on the wrong side sometimes, but I thank God for the times when they're right.\" This article first appeared in May 2006 issue of Christianity Today.

Thank you for posting a link to at least one case. Here are excerpts from the ACLU position on this matter. quote: \"Contrary to what some believe,\" said Peter Eliasberg, staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California and First Amendment specialist, \"it is not the role of the federal government to advance Christianity or any other sectarian belief. Americans are perfectly competent to make such decisions for themselves without government interference.\" \"The federal government,\" said Eliasberg, \"should not offer public land \u2013 owned collectively by people of every faith and of no faith \u2013 as a site for the advertisement and promotion of Jesus Christ, Buddha, Pope John Paul II, or any other particular religious figure.\" \"If anyone was allowed to place a permanent, free-standing expression of his or her religious or political viewpoint at this site,\" said Eliasberg, \"we would have no objection, but that is not the case. No other group is allowed to do that. This creates a situation in which the federal government favors Christian expression over any other.\" ************* Much of the controversy surrounding the cross concerned its status as a site where Christian veterans gather to remember war dead in special services. But not all veterans are in agreement about the cross. Morris Radin, an 82-year old Jewish veteran of World War II, spoke at the press conference to describe his experience of fighting for the principles he believes this country was founded on. \"My father, Abe, was just eighteen when he came to America and became an American citizen,\" said Radin. \"As an Orthodox Jew, he knew firsthand what happens when people are not free to practice their beliefs. He and my mother Sophie both left Russia to escape the pogroms. They never told me whether they had witnessed any of the atrocities born of that nation's inability to guarantee their freedom of religion. They drew a curtain on that period of their lives and faced a new life in a different place.\" \"They came to America without knowing the language,\" said Radin, \"but knowing the larger language of America's promise. America is big enough for everyone to practice his or her own faith and where no one faith is privileged over any other or over none at all. Abe and Sophie Radin loved this country as passionately and profoundly as any citizen.\" \"The country they loved is the country I fought for and love as well,\" said Radin, \"a country founded on principle, on freedom of conscience and religion, a country where the government isn't Christian or Jewish or Muslim, but can welcome all of these and more on a free and equal basis. That is the country I defend in supporting this legal action.\" \u201chttp://www.aclu-sc.org/releases/view/100354\u201d Dave",

A monument on private land, and private funds, is not the business of government to interfere with. As I said before if someone feels that the best way to honor veterans is to make a monument consisting of Spongebob Square Pants, that is their business. But when it's government land, then either let every religious belief have the right to put up a monument, or have no one put up a religious monument. One would think from Rays orginal post that the ACLU was attacking the Vietnam Memorial, 'cause they just hate America. But anyone can go to Washington and see and respect and be respected BY the Vietnam Memorial. If one goes to Arlington to respect the dead, as I have, I see crosses and every other symbol of religion or NO symbol of religion. Indeed, I've read that you can even see Wiccan symbols. But that's all inclusive. It is the families who choose how to remember their loved ones. No one, least of all the ACLU protests crosses at Arlington. Dave",

The Cross is styled after those in National Cemetaries such as at Normandy's American Cemetary, Colleville sur Mere. It has been in place since 1934 when erected to honor fallen World War One Soldiers. Then it was also on Private land, it since has become a Park. The US Congress enacted HR 4457 to keep it from being removed. Before that the property was transferred to a private orginzation and the ACLU sued over that.", 
        "reply": " The cross has also been replaced at government expense and the groups that support the cross (but would not fund it which is why it was turned over to the government) also have fought putting up anything for veterans of other religions at the site. This was created as a Christian monument on private land and then turned over to the government when the private groups could not or would not pay for upkeep. As long as it is paid for with government funds it can NOT be a Christian only site.",
