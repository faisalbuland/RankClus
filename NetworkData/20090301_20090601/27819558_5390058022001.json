        "content": "DP Bill Heats Up in Nevada A domestic-partnership bill that could establish many rights for Nevada same-sex couples was introduced in the state legislature, but the governor has said he will veto it. \"I just don't believe in it,\" Republican governor Jim Gibbons (pictured) said on Tuesday, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The bill was introduced by David Parks, a state senator from Las Vegas. The full senate will vote on it in the next few days. If the bill were to become law, same-sex and opposite-sex couples would be able to register their relationships with the secretary of state\u2019s office and be granted tax and visitation rights that are currently unavailable to them. >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid79090.asp",
