Now we see a family therapist once a month so to talk about me joining the marines but i want to stop seeing the doctor because i know i cant join if i dont. will taking the meds for 5 days DQ me from joining even though my parents agree it was their fault, and that im not depresed. and my doctor said im not depressed and that he will give me a note saying what happened wasnt my fault but my parents overrracted. will this keep me from joining the corps? also when i was 15 i took my parents car out and got pulled over but nothing major happened, but my friend did the same thing and he got it waivered very easily im more concerned with the meds tho so what do u guys think?",
