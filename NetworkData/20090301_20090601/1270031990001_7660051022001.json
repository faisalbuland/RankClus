What I see is man being tempted by intelligence to think he is above God. This is written. I would guess that your perception just might be a testament to your own bias against Christians. Most all of you threads are evidence of this bias you hold. Lastly, I thank you for ending with well wishes for me in my spiritual path. I believe you to be sincere and I am sincere in praying for the same to you. I like you Whirled_Peas. I always have. I do believe I have shown arrogance to you before as I was teasing you a bit in a couple of threads long ago. For this I am sorry and ask your forgiveness. I have come to feel that you maybe the way you are from falling victim to the bashing by some Christians for quite some time here and elsewhere and this saddens me. So I would like to state that I believe you have a good heart and sincerely want the best for all peoples. This is what we share in common. Just as this thread was by a new poster, for us to forgive and heal the past we need to be willing to start anew. This is what Easter is about to us Christians and I know you have similar beliefs. I believe it is what makes us grow straight and strong. - LegionSon -",

Post prayer threads.\" I will agree with you in the arrogance factor that consumes us all from time to time, but I contest your singling out any group such as the Christians as being \"the vast majority\". What I see is man being tempted by intelligence to think he is above God. This is written. I would guess that your perception just might be a testament to your own bias against Christians. Most all of you threads are evidence of this bias you hold. Lastly, I thank you for ending with well wishes for me in my spiritual path. I believe you to be sincere and I am sincere in praying for the same to you. I like you Whirled_Peas. I always have. I do believe I have shown arrogance to you before as I was teasing you a bit in a couple of threads long ago. For this I am sorry and ask your forgiveness. I have come to feel that you maybe the way you are from falling victim to the bashing by some Christians for quite some time here and elsewhere and this saddens me. So I would like to state that I believe you have a good heart and sincerely want the best for all peoples. This is what we share in common. Just as this thread was by a new poster, for us to forgive and heal the past we need to be willing to start anew. This is what Easter is about to us Christians and I know you have similar beliefs. I believe it is what makes us grow straight and strong. - LegionSon -",

Haven't said that about you, directly. I don't think your 'problem' is because you are a Christian. And I certainly do not believe everyone who believes in unseen being is 'crazy'. Humans believe all kinds of things that are not true... some of them are obnoxious about it. Others are not. Coming to grips with reality takes a while.

You ask a generalized question and I gave a generalized answer. You want to defend yourself, go right ahead, but you are swinging at shadows. I never picked a fight with you Cat, but have responded to quite a few haven't I?? So who do you 'pick' fights with?

Anyway, historical, the Jews have not been a problem (since 70AD and the Masada madness, anyway.) But many Christians, on the other hand, have been a big problem!! So I have a somewhat sarcastic attitude to the Christian's self congratulatory attitude and the extolling of their hero 'messiah' when in fact it is problem, the number one cause of unjustified suffering on the planet.... even of the Jews.

There are all kinds of people who read here and not all are nice or military. The e-mail service here is called a blind service, some one can contact you but they will NOT have your personal e-mail address. They contact you through your profile with a form that comes up. They write what they choose and click send. Milcom then sends it \"in the blind\" and after a few contacts with that person you both can decide if you want to exchange addresses. It's a whole lot simpler to do, than it is to tell!! You didn't get in trouble, they just didn't want you to get stuck with a possible nutbag!!! T",

Starting with him killing the cop. and running away. Why didn't god intervene then? ...and so on. I don't care which religion wants to claim it as a guide for moral standards, it's a mean spirited lesson in hate and ego mania (my secular view.) The Christian attempt to make it more user friendly still leaves the story there. (For the life of me, I can't see why Xians focus so much on what is attributed to Moses!??) I like the Bible stories, they are so human, etc. But I think it is silly to use the bible in its entirety for a rule for culture. It fails miserably.

Well since Moses was one of \"your\" guys I asked why he doesn't jab you the way he does Christians....kinda seems like a double standard doesn't it? She can own up to what she wants, ..you do. You plunder her book all the time. So be it. There is no double standard. I am much more familiar with the excitable Christian take on the scheme of the god business (Bible) than I am of the Jews.

Haven't said that about you, directly. I don't think your 'problem' is because you are a Christian. And I certainly do not believe everyone who believes in unseen being is 'crazy'. Humans believe all kinds of things that are not true... some of them are obnoxious about it. Others are not. Coming to grips with reality takes a while.

He either wants to be treated as well as he thinks I treat you or for me to treat you as badly as he thinks I treat him?? Anyway, historical, the Jews have not been a problem (since 70AD and the Masada madness, anyway.) But many Christians, on the other hand, have been a big problem!! So I have a somewhat sarcastic attitude to the Christian's self congratulatory attitude and the extolling of their hero 'messiah' when in fact it is problem, the number one cause of unjustified suffering on the planet.... even of the Jews. And some of them continue to \"terrorize\" many of us with the coming of their messianic hope and our eventual eradicate for the good of the Kingdom (but save the Jews, of course.) I wouldn't be a bit surprised in the nuttiness of that eschatologcal thinking that a great deal more grief can be brought about for the world in the future. It's crazy!",

I don't know? When? To save you, and everybody else, a lot of research, NEVER!!! Oh, ok. You are \"absorbing\" unintended guilt, Bruce. I don't think your are mentioned in the post? You ask a generalized question and I gave a generalized answer. You want to defend yourself, go right ahead, but you are swinging at shadows. I never picked a fight with you Cat, but have responded to quite a few haven't I?? So who do you 'pick' fights with? So you aren't my enemy, and I am not yours, but by this question, I can see once again, this may be my one sided opinion. T", 
        "reply": " quote: RT, I wonder why would Tawodi like to create animosity between you and me? Ixcatzin I think T was a bit excited, Ixcatzin, that maybe I like you (your) posts better? He either wants to be treated as well as he thinks I treat you or for me to treat you as badly as he thinks I treat him?? Anyway, historical, the Jews have not been a problem (since 70AD and the Masada madness, anyway.) But many Christians, on the other hand, have been a big problem!! So I have a somewhat sarcastic attitude to the Christian's self congratulatory attitude and the extolling of their hero 'messiah' when in fact it is problem, the number one cause of unjustified suffering on the planet.... even of the Jews. And some of them continue to \"terrorize\" many of us with the coming of their messianic hope and our eventual eradicate for the good of the Kingdom (but save the Jews, of course.) I wouldn't be a bit surprised in the nuttiness of that eschatologcal thinking that a great deal more grief can be brought about for the world in the future. It's crazy!",

Ixcatzin Hehh, now calm down Ixcatzin...you know I admire you. It just seems obvious to me and Tawodi how some like to push your buttons. I thought you were aware of this and were just playing along for the desired effect. As Tawodi said he is not your enemy and I have not expressed any insult to you or your religion. You can't really say that of a few others. They do it in the manner of mentioning both our religions and have the desire to pit us against eachother.
