I've discussed it in other threads, as have other individuals, but we haven't really dedicated a discussion to the nature of extremism, what it means, where it comes from, and how to combat extremism of EVERY religion from which it arises. What started me off? Well, one of the watchdog groups I follow posted a link to this today: \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1yaaW37CoM The person who made that video has his head so deep into conspiracy theory that he sounds absolutely bonkers. But you can tell that he believes it. This is a guy who took what USED to be the Christian religion, THEN got swept up in it as a political cultural movement, and THEN adopted a victim complex, and THEN went over the top with conspiracy theories. Clearly, that's not Christianity. That's several steps REMOVED from Christianity. But can we take this as a model of how cults, extremists groups, and even terrorist cells of ANY religion develop? And how much more does it take to push a person like this to become violent? What, as Americans who care about both our country and our faith, can we do to recognize, diffuse, and prevent this sort of extremist attitude from developing and spreading? Please discuss. Feel free to cite examples of modern extremism from any religion. We're not discussing the beliefs of those individual religions - we're discussing how extremism develops, and why extremism is dangerous regardless of from what religion it stems.",

We have become a mentality of insular thinkers, of the me first squeeky wheel mentality and it's down hill from there. Now this phenomena is world wide, because for centuries this has been the way, to defeat and control, populations of nations. The only reason America was so spectacularly successful, even with so many faults, is because when the chips are down we come together as a people.

Well over the last years it has reached the point to where the Congress thinks it will get away with the crap they're pulling right now, so refute THAT, if you can! That is a symptom only, we have listened to the media and others and the result is easy to see. We can't conduct and win a war against a ****ant nation of third rate buffoons and now in A Stan, they have strenghtened to the point that a third nation is almost ready to be dragged into the fray. (Pakistan) Who just happens to have nuclear weapons and people crazy enough to use them, from a cultural basis based in death! We are playing with fire and Barry O is talking about increasing pressure on them to conform to our wishes. 85 percent of the people there have come to mistrust us, if not genuinely hate our guts, and we from our paper tiger position, are tweeking their tails!! So there you go, lets create a whole new class of downtrodden and see how easy it is, to identify and then become, monsters!! This message has been edited.

Not entirely true, T. I recently watched an eighteen part series from BBC about Leonardo di Vinci. I guess it depends on what you're looking for. It's a little like a street or a strip mall.
