As one on another thread suggested when this very thing happened, he said something along the lines of 'looks like we just did another term paper' (see why we joined) I think it was. Some preacher wanted to know why we joined for a sermon... well, said preacher never came back to say thanks or anything... so this is what I think the \"tinkler\" is speaking of.
