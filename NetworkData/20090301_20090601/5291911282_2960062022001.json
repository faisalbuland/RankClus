All the Unit Pages that show maintained by Military.com, have the provision to add a related page down to the company level, that will show up on there parent page. If you are a member that has a few units listed in your profile, you can see them by using this url. http://www.military.com/Groups/MyGroupsAll Every unit page that are supposed be maintained by military.com, show up here as Military Admin. If you click on it, you will see it shows E4 Military Admin. He has only 2 or 3 units showing in his profile. This may have been done by the tech guys as a work around for some thing, of a separate person, but it is causing the problem. Look here to see what is happening. http://www.qsl.net/wd4ngb/military%20com.htm If you try to add a Related Homepage to any of your units, it will only allow you to make a separate page that does not directly relate to your unit page. The last step while trying to do this, does not even show the unit as a option. A example to this is I was assigned to A Company 304th Signal Bn. It has a unit page here. http://unitpages.military.com/unitpages/unit.do?id=104587 Under Related Homepages,it list B co. C co, and D co. I tried to add A Co, but in the last step, it does not give the option to add a related page to the 304th Signal. The problem is the system thinks that all these Unit Pages belong to E4 Military Admin. I am sure some how the military.com listed on the 304th page, and the Military Admin, that links to a E4 military admin, which is set up as a individuals page is the problem. If a page is made as it is now, it will not show up as a Related Homepage,, and will be a completely independent page. I have sent emails to Support, and they still can not see the problem.",
