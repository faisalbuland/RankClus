But, it is becoming clear that many people are finally coming around to the fact that the here and now is all you have, so it is best to enjoy it while you can. So Religious people are weak and unable to cope. Thats kind of a cynical outlook don't you think? I've seen Religious people contribute far more to our society and to the world as a whole then non-Religious people. I see them get ridiculed and their religions disrespected in public as well as other forms of direct harrassment or direct insults. Yet still they rise to the ocassion and accomplish things the non-relgious do not seem willing or are unable to accomplish. Why do you suppose that is?",
        "reply": " And I have seen (supposedly) religious people perpetrate heinous crimes against humanity in the name of their religion. There are good people and there are bad people, religion has nothing to do with it. The best religious people I know do not wear it on their sleeves. The worse religious people I know shout it to the heavens (no pun intended). Its more about human nature and less about God\u2019s will.",

I guess people are tired of hypocritical, spoon-fed dogma that crushes the very essence of spirituality, and are finding less hateful ways to embrace God and their own spiritual paths. I watched the children playing after the service last Sunday - kids who will be taught compassion and kindness, not hate, fear, prejudice, or bigotry - and it gave me a bit of hope for the future.",

They run from their fantastic Countries to here, soon there`s more of them than you can count !! When you run from evil,...you go to the good,...and that`s all the confirmation I need !! I think many of the people who were born here in the U.S. have done plenty to move away from religion...of any sort that is. Too many \"What's in it for me?\" types taking over the country. Don",
        "reply": " More like to many examples of Religious LEADERS and organization that put power and appearance before what their religion is supposed to stand for. IMO over time Religious organization become more concerned with the organization than with the Religion.",

I guess people are tired of hypocritical, spoon-fed dogma that crushes the very essence of spirituality, and are finding less hateful ways to embrace God and their own spiritual paths. I watched the children playing after the service last Sunday - kids who will be taught compassion and kindness, not hate, fear, prejudice, or bigotry - and it gave me a bit of hope for the future.",

So Religious people are weak and unable to cope. Thats kind of a cynical outlook don't you think? I've seen Religious people contribute far more to our society and to the world as a whole then non-Religious people. I see them get ridiculed and their religions disrespected in public as well as other forms of direct harrassment or direct insults. Yet still they rise to the ocassion and accomplish things the non-relgious do not seem willing or are unable to accomplish. Why do you suppose that is? And I have seen (supposedly) religious people perpetrate heinous crimes against humanity in the name of their religion. There are good people and there are bad people, religion has nothing to do with it. The best religious people I know do not wear it on their sleeves. The worse religious people I know shout it to the heavens (no pun intended). Its more about human nature and less about God\u2019s will.",
