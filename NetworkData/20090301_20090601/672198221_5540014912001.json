I holded nothing aginst you and 20 of your friends for raping my daughter then gutting her and hung her body upside down on some bridge headless.... And the one who lost a son...Hey its okay, that was his job, he got caught by you and you cut his balls off, gutted him and skin him alive...then threw his body down a out house in a pile of shi*. We found what was left of him about 5 yrs after you did it..but its okay..here want some more tea and crackers... Talk is big until it hits home, just like 9/11, only the families know what that hurt is, not you or you or you, you know the ones who post c crap on this site. The so call big guys..who support finger fighting over real fighting and defending our country. If it takes torture then it takes torture..and you can re-assure the person that the info he gave you is wrong, more is to come...now if he is that tuff and does that.
