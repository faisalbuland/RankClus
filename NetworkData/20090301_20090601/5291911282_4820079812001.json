My current problem is that I have two underage drinking tickets and also a trespass to land ticket. My trespass to land ticket is what is holding me up right now. My recruiter is unsure if it'll keep me from getting in until its over 5 years ago which is next june. My ticket is a non-criminal offense and is actually listed in the records as a trespass to land ticket and not a trespass to property ticket which is the ticket my recruiter has on his list. So I'm just wondering if they are the same thing or if it wont affect my process as I'll be under the amount of tickets that can hold you up.",
