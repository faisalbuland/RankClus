They were great neighbors and \"Hete\" was a great guy and his wife was a nice as pie. My Dad always said it was their business what was going on. They were never physical but they did fight verbally. This was in the early sixties and people treated their neighbors a bit differently than they do now. If the argument is spilling into your home through the walls that's a different story and could cause your children some anxiety. Maybe if you talked to the wife, like \"G\" says if they can be courteous about it then work it out. Nobody needs trouble either and you might want to avoid that.

The lady across from me called the cops on her neigbors twice for Domestic violence. Cops never hauled anyone in as they played the ''officer, we don't know what you're talking about''.
