        "content": "From the LA Times: Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool The role of the CIA's controversial prisoner-transfer program may expand, intelligence experts say. By Greg Miller February 01, 2009 The CIA's secret prisons are being shuttered. Harsh interrogation techniques are off-limits. And Guantanamo Bay will eventually go back to being a wind-swept naval base on the southeastern corner of Cuba. But even while dismantling these programs, President Obama left intact an equally controversial counter-terrorism tool. Under executive orders issued by Obama recently, the CIA still has authority to carry out what are known as renditions, secret abductions and transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate with the United States. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that the rendition program might be poised to play an expanded role going forward because it was the main remaining mechanism -- aside from Predator missile strikes -- for taking suspected terrorists off the street. The rendition program became a source of embarrassment for the CIA, and a target of international scorn, as details emerged in recent years of botched captures, mistaken identities and allegations that prisoners were turned over to countries where they were tortured. The European Parliament condemned renditions as \"an illegal instrument used by the United States.\" Prisoners swept up in the program have sued the CIA as well as a Boeing Co. subsidiary accused of working with the agency on dozens of rendition flights. But the Obama administration appears to have determined that the rendition program was one component of the Bush administration's war on terrorism that it could not afford to discard. The decision underscores the fact that the battle with Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is far from over and that even if the United States is shutting down the prisons, it is not done taking prisoners. \"Obviously you need to preserve some tools, you still have to go after the bad guys,\" said an Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing the legal reasoning. \"The legal advisors working on this looked at rendition. It is controversial in some circles and kicked up a big storm in Europe. But if done within certain parameters, it is an acceptable practice.\" One provision in one of Obama's orders appears to preserve the CIA's ability to detain and interrogate terrorism suspects as long as they are not held long-term. The little-noticed provision states that the instructions to close the CIA's secret prison sites \"do not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short-term, transitory basis.\" Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool The role of the CIA's controversial prisoner-transfer program may expand, intelligence experts say. By Greg Miller February 01, 2009 Despite concern about rendition, Obama's prohibition against the use of most other counter-terrorism tools could prompt intelligence officers to resort more frequently to the \"transitory\" technique. The decision to preserve the program did not draw major protests, even among human rights groups. Leaders of such organizations said that reflected a sense that the United States and other nations needed certain tools to combat terrorism. \"Under limited circumstances, there is a legitimate place\" for renditions, said Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. \"What I heard loud and clear from the president's order was that they want to design a system that doesn't result in people being sent to foreign dungeons to be tortured. But that designing that system is going to take some time.\" Malinowski said that he had urged the Obama administration to require that prisoners be transferred to other countries only when they would be guaranteed a public hearing in an official court. \"Producing a prisoner before a real court is a key safeguard against torture, abuse and disappearance,\" Malinowski said. CIA veterans involved in the rendition program said that it was an important capability, but used mainly for terrorism suspects not valuable enough for the agency to keep, and that the program was of limited use in gathering intelligence. \"The reason we did interrogations [ourselves] is because renditions for the most part weren't very productive,\" said a former senior CIA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject. The most valuable intelligence on Al Qaeda came from prisoners who were in CIA custody and questioned by agency experts, the official said. Once prisoners were turned over to other countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, the agency had limited ability to influence how much intelligence was shared, how prisoners were treated and whether they were later released. \"In some ways, [rendition] is the worst option,\" the former official said. \"If they are in U.S. hands, you have a lot of checks and balances, medics and lawyers. Once you turn them over to another service, you lose control.\" In his executive order on lawful interrogations, Obama created a task force to reexamine renditions to make sure that they \"do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture,\" or otherwise circumvent human rights laws and treaties.",

President Bush and his crew were not always concerned about legalities and ended up getting CIA agents indicted by foreign governments and kidnapping innocent people by mistake with their version of the extraordinary rendition program. President Obama can authorize a rendition program that is NOT the same as the Bush era rendition program, but is legal. Examples of legal rendition \u2013 Mir Aimal Kasi killed CIA employees in 1993 while they were at a stop light on their way to CIA headquarters. At 4 a.m. on the morning of June 15, 1997, an armed team of FBI agents, working with the Pakistani ISI, raided Kasi's hotel room. His fingerprints were taken on the scene, confirming his identity. There is some dispute over where Kasi was taken next\u2014US authorities claim it was a holding facility run by Pakistani authorities, while Pakistani sources claim it was the US embassy in Islamabad \u2014 before being flown to the US on June 17 in a C-141 transport. During the flight, Kasi made a full oral and written confession to the FBI without being tortured. Kasi's extrajudicial rendition was controversial in Pakistan\u2014no formal request for his extradition was made, and no extradition proceedings were initiated. US authorities would later assert the rendition was legal under an extradition treaty signed with the UK, before Partition when India was under colonial rule. Kasi argued against his rendition in court but his assertions were found to have no basis in law. The Court wrote: \u2026the treaty between the United States and Pakistan contains no provision that bars forcible abductions, nor does it otherwise 'purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for the purposes of prosecution.' Id. at 664 (emphasis added). Nor does the treaty provide that, once a request for extradition is made, the procedures outlined in the treaty become the sole means of transferring custody of a suspected criminal from one country to the other. Finally, because Kasi was not returned to the United States via extradition proceedings initiated under the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Pakistan, Kasi's reliance upon United States v. Rauscher does not avail him Kasi was executed by lethal injection on November 14, 2002. On February 7, 1995, Pakistani intelligence and U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security Special Agents Bill Miller and Jeff Riner captured Ramzi Ahmed Yousefin Islamabad, Pakistan. Yousef was flown back to the United States where he was convicted of the 1993 bombing of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. This dangerous terrorist, who is the nephew of 9/11 master mind, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is serving a life sentence in an American prison. On March 1, 2003, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence reported that they had captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in a raid in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in a joint raid with the CIA's Special Activities Division paramilitary operatives. Following the report of the capture, some Pakistani officials say he was immediately transferred to U.S. custody without extradition proceedings, while others said he remained in Pakistani custody. Where the rendition became illegal - he was not transported to the United States or to a declared detention center but was sent to a secret prison \u2013 which is a violation of international law. Secret prisons were outlawed by the international community after WWII because the Nazis used to make people disappear without their families or local authorities being informed of the person's situation.",

But even while dismantling these programs, President Obama left intact an equally controversial counter-terrorism tool. Under executive orders issued by Obama recently, the CIA still has authority to carry out what are known as renditions, secret abductions and transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate with the United States. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that the rendition program might be poised to play an expanded role going forward because it was the main remaining mechanism -- aside from Predator missile strikes -- for taking suspected terrorists off the street. The rendition program became a source of embarrassment for the CIA, and a target of international scorn, as details emerged in recent years of botched captures, mistaken identities and allegations that prisoners were turned over to countries where they were tortured. The European Parliament condemned renditions as \"an illegal instrument used by the United States.\" Prisoners swept up in the program have sued the CIA as well as a Boeing Co. subsidiary accused of working with the agency on dozens of rendition flights. But the Obama administration appears to have determined that the rendition program was one component of the Bush administration's war on terrorism that it could not afford to discard. The decision underscores the fact that the battle with Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is far from over and that even if the United States is shutting down the prisons, it is not done taking prisoners. \"Obviously you need to preserve some tools, you still have to go after the bad guys,\" said an Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing the legal reasoning. \"The legal advisors working on this looked at rendition. It is controversial in some circles and kicked up a big storm in Europe. But if done within certain parameters, it is an acceptable practice.\" One provision in one of Obama's orders appears to preserve the CIA's ability to detain and interrogate terrorism suspects as long as they are not held long-term. The little-noticed provision states that the instructions to close the CIA's secret prison sites \"do not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short-term, transitory basis.\" Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool The role of the CIA's controversial prisoner-transfer program may expand, intelligence experts say. By Greg Miller February 01, 2009 Despite concern about rendition, Obama's prohibition against the use of most other counter-terrorism tools could prompt intelligence officers to resort more frequently to the \"transitory\" technique. The decision to preserve the program did not draw major protests, even among human rights groups. Leaders of such organizations said that reflected a sense that the United States and other nations needed certain tools to combat terrorism. \"Under limited circumstances, there is a legitimate place\" for renditions, said Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. \"What I heard loud and clear from the president's order was that they want to design a system that doesn't result in people being sent to foreign dungeons to be tortured. But that designing that system is going to take some time.\" Malinowski said that he had urged the Obama administration to require that prisoners be transferred to other countries only when they would be guaranteed a public hearing in an official court. \"Producing a prisoner before a real court is a key safeguard against torture, abuse and disappearance,\" Malinowski said. CIA veterans involved in the rendition program said that it was an important capability, but used mainly for terrorism suspects not valuable enough for the agency to keep, and that the program was of limited use in gathering intelligence. \"The reason we did interrogations [ourselves] is because renditions for the most part weren't very productive,\" said a former senior CIA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject. The most valuable intelligence on Al Qaeda came from prisoners who were in CIA custody and questioned by agency experts, the official said. Once prisoners were turned over to other countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, the agency had limited ability to influence how much intelligence was shared, how prisoners were treated and whether they were later released. \"In some ways, [rendition] is the worst option,\" the former official said. \"If they are in U.S. hands, you have a lot of checks and balances, medics and lawyers. Once you turn them over to another service, you lose control.\" In his executive order on lawful interrogations, Obama created a task force to reexamine renditions to make sure that they \"do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture,\" or otherwise circumvent human rights laws and treaties.",

If the abductions and transfers are in secret, those regs you quoted just don't apply. The guy just disappears. Your welcome!",

But these people need to be captured or killed to win the war against them. There are legal ways to carry out the rendition program, President Obama has ordered his people to find a way to carry out this program legally. President Bush and his crew were not always concerned about legalities and ended up getting CIA agents indicted by foreign governments and kidnapping innocent people by mistake with their version of the extraordinary rendition program. President Obama can authorize a rendition program that is NOT the same as the Bush era rendition program, but is legal.

At 4 a.m. on the morning of June 15, 1997, an armed team of FBI agents, working with the Pakistani ISI, raided Kasi's hotel room. His fingerprints were taken on the scene, confirming his identity. There is some dispute over where Kasi was taken next\u2014US authorities claim it was a holding facility run by Pakistani authorities, while Pakistani sources claim it was the US embassy in Islamabad \u2014 before being flown to the US on June 17 in a C-141 transport. During the flight, Kasi made a full oral and written confession to the FBI without being tortured. Kasi's extrajudicial rendition was controversial in Pakistan\u2014no formal request for his extradition was made, and no extradition proceedings were initiated. US authorities would later assert the rendition was legal under an extradition treaty signed with the UK, before Partition when India was under colonial rule. Kasi argued against his rendition in court but his assertions were found to have no basis in law. The Court wrote: \u2026the treaty between the United States and Pakistan contains no provision that bars forcible abductions, nor does it otherwise 'purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for the purposes of prosecution.' Id. at 664 (emphasis added). Nor does the treaty provide that, once a request for extradition is made, the procedures outlined in the treaty become the sole means of transferring custody of a suspected criminal from one country to the other. Finally, because Kasi was not returned to the United States via extradition proceedings initiated under the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Pakistan, Kasi's reliance upon United States v. Rauscher does not avail him Kasi was executed by lethal injection on November 14, 2002. On February 7, 1995, Pakistani intelligence and U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security Special Agents Bill Miller and Jeff Riner captured Ramzi Ahmed Yousefin Islamabad, Pakistan. Yousef was flown back to the United States where he was convicted of the 1993 bombing of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. This dangerous terrorist, who is the nephew of 9/11 master mind, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is serving a life sentence in an American prison. On March 1, 2003, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence reported that they had captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in a raid in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in a joint raid with the CIA's Special Activities Division paramilitary operatives. Following the report of the capture, some Pakistani officials say he was immediately transferred to U.S. custody without extradition proceedings, while others said he remained in Pakistani custody. Where the rendition became illegal - he was not transported to the United States or to a declared detention center but was sent to a secret prison \u2013 which is a violation of international law. Secret prisons were outlawed by the international community after WWII because the Nazis used to make people disappear without their families or local authorities being informed of the person's situation.",

        "content": "From the LA Times: Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool The role of the CIA's controversial prisoner-transfer program may expand, intelligence experts say. By Greg Miller February 01, 2009 The CIA's secret prisons are being shuttered. Harsh interrogation techniques are off-limits. And Guantanamo Bay will eventually go back to being a wind-swept naval base on the southeastern corner of Cuba. But even while dismantling these programs, President Obama left intact an equally controversial counter-terrorism tool. Under executive orders issued by Obama recently, the CIA still has authority to carry out what are known as renditions, secret abductions and transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate with the United States. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that the rendition program might be poised to play an expanded role going forward because it was the main remaining mechanism -- aside from Predator missile strikes -- for taking suspected terrorists off the street. The rendition program became a source of embarrassment for the CIA, and a target of international scorn, as details emerged in recent years of botched captures, mistaken identities and allegations that prisoners were turned over to countries where they were tortured. The European Parliament condemned renditions as \"an illegal instrument used by the United States.\" Prisoners swept up in the program have sued the CIA as well as a Boeing Co. subsidiary accused of working with the agency on dozens of rendition flights. But the Obama administration appears to have determined that the rendition program was one component of the Bush administration's war on terrorism that it could not afford to discard. The decision underscores the fact that the battle with Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is far from over and that even if the United States is shutting down the prisons, it is not done taking prisoners. \"Obviously you need to preserve some tools, you still have to go after the bad guys,\" said an Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing the legal reasoning. \"The legal advisors working on this looked at rendition. It is controversial in some circles and kicked up a big storm in Europe. But if done within certain parameters, it is an acceptable practice.\" One provision in one of Obama's orders appears to preserve the CIA's ability to detain and interrogate terrorism suspects as long as they are not held long-term. The little-noticed provision states that the instructions to close the CIA's secret prison sites \"do not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short-term, transitory basis.\" Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool The role of the CIA's controversial prisoner-transfer program may expand, intelligence experts say. By Greg Miller February 01, 2009 Despite concern about rendition, Obama's prohibition against the use of most other counter-terrorism tools could prompt intelligence officers to resort more frequently to the \"transitory\" technique. The decision to preserve the program did not draw major protests, even among human rights groups. Leaders of such organizations said that reflected a sense that the United States and other nations needed certain tools to combat terrorism. \"Under limited circumstances, there is a legitimate place\" for renditions, said Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. \"What I heard loud and clear from the president's order was that they want to design a system that doesn't result in people being sent to foreign dungeons to be tortured. But that designing that system is going to take some time.\" Malinowski said that he had urged the Obama administration to require that prisoners be transferred to other countries only when they would be guaranteed a public hearing in an official court. \"Producing a prisoner before a real court is a key safeguard against torture, abuse and disappearance,\" Malinowski said. CIA veterans involved in the rendition program said that it was an important capability, but used mainly for terrorism suspects not valuable enough for the agency to keep, and that the program was of limited use in gathering intelligence. \"The reason we did interrogations [ourselves] is because renditions for the most part weren't very productive,\" said a former senior CIA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject. The most valuable intelligence on Al Qaeda came from prisoners who were in CIA custody and questioned by agency experts, the official said. Once prisoners were turned over to other countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, the agency had limited ability to influence how much intelligence was shared, how prisoners were treated and whether they were later released. \"In some ways, [rendition] is the worst option,\" the former official said. \"If they are in U.S. hands, you have a lot of checks and balances, medics and lawyers. Once you turn them over to another service, you lose control.\" In his executive order on lawful interrogations, Obama created a task force to reexamine renditions to make sure that they \"do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture,\" or otherwise circumvent human rights laws and treaties.",

Well, the article I posted from the LA Times pretty much provides proof. Unless you can produce an article from a valid, reputable source that states that the Obama administration hasn't continued the policy of rendition. So, how do you reconcile the use of rendition, even the possible expansion as stated in the article (because our intelligence capabilities were diminished by the release of the \"torture\" memos), by the current administration?",

The planners who radicalize Muslims to become suicide bombers do not go onto a battlefield. The operational/logistic people do not expose themselves to the violent acts that al Qaeda carries out. But these people need to be captured or killed to win the war against them. There are legal ways to carry out the rendition program, President Obama has ordered his people to find a way to carry out this program legally. President Bush and his crew were not always concerned about legalities and ended up getting CIA agents indicted by foreign governments and kidnapping innocent people by mistake with their version of the extraordinary rendition program. President Obama can authorize a rendition program that is NOT the same as the Bush era rendition program, but is legal. Examples of legal rendition \u2013 Mir Aimal Kasi killed CIA employees in 1993 while they were at a stop light on their way to CIA headquarters. At 4 a.m. on the morning of June 15, 1997, an armed team of FBI agents, working with the Pakistani ISI, raided Kasi's hotel room. His fingerprints were taken on the scene, confirming his identity. There is some dispute over where Kasi was taken next\u2014US authorities claim it was a holding facility run by Pakistani authorities, while Pakistani sources claim it was the US embassy in Islamabad \u2014 before being flown to the US on June 17 in a C-141 transport. During the flight, Kasi made a full oral and written confession to the FBI without being tortured. Kasi's extrajudicial rendition was controversial in Pakistan\u2014no formal request for his extradition was made, and no extradition proceedings were initiated. US authorities would later assert the rendition was legal under an extradition treaty signed with the UK, before Partition when India was under colonial rule. Kasi argued against his rendition in court but his assertions were found to have no basis in law. The Court wrote: \u2026the treaty between the United States and Pakistan contains no provision that bars forcible abductions, nor does it otherwise 'purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for the purposes of prosecution.' Id. at 664 (emphasis added). Nor does the treaty provide that, once a request for extradition is made, the procedures outlined in the treaty become the sole means of transferring custody of a suspected criminal from one country to the other. Finally, because Kasi was not returned to the United States via extradition proceedings initiated under the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Pakistan, Kasi's reliance upon United States v. Rauscher does not avail him Kasi was executed by lethal injection on November 14, 2002. On February 7, 1995, Pakistani intelligence and U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security Special Agents Bill Miller and Jeff Riner captured Ramzi Ahmed Yousefin Islamabad, Pakistan. Yousef was flown back to the United States where he was convicted of the 1993 bombing of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. This dangerous terrorist, who is the nephew of 9/11 master mind, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is serving a life sentence in an American prison. On March 1, 2003, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence reported that they had captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in a raid in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in a joint raid with the CIA's Special Activities Division paramilitary operatives. Following the report of the capture, some Pakistani officials say he was immediately transferred to U.S. custody without extradition proceedings, while others said he remained in Pakistani custody. Where the rendition became illegal - he was not transported to the United States or to a declared detention center but was sent to a secret prison \u2013 which is a violation of international law. Secret prisons were outlawed by the international community after WWII because the Nazis used to make people disappear without their families or local authorities being informed of the person's situation.",

But these people need to be captured or killed to win the war against them. There are legal ways to carry out the rendition program, President Obama has ordered his people to find a way to carry out this program legally. President Bush and his crew were not always concerned about legalities and ended up getting CIA agents indicted by foreign governments and kidnapping innocent people by mistake with their version of the extraordinary rendition program. President Obama can authorize a rendition program that is NOT the same as the Bush era rendition program, but is legal. Examples of legal rendition \u2013 Mir Aimal Kasi killed CIA employees in 1993 while they were at a stop light on their way to CIA headquarters. At 4 a.m. on the morning of June 15, 1997, an armed team of FBI agents, working with the Pakistani ISI, raided Kasi's hotel room. His fingerprints were taken on the scene, confirming his identity. There is some dispute over where Kasi was taken next\u2014US authorities claim it was a holding facility run by Pakistani authorities, while Pakistani sources claim it was the US embassy in Islamabad \u2014 before being flown to the US on June 17 in a C-141 transport. During the flight, Kasi made a full oral and written confession to the FBI without being tortured. Kasi's extrajudicial rendition was controversial in Pakistan\u2014no formal request for his extradition was made, and no extradition proceedings were initiated. US authorities would later assert the rendition was legal under an extradition treaty signed with the UK, before Partition when India was under colonial rule. Kasi argued against his rendition in court but his assertions were found to have no basis in law. The Court wrote: \u2026the treaty between the United States and Pakistan contains no provision that bars forcible abductions, nor does it otherwise 'purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for the purposes of prosecution.' Id. at 664 (emphasis added). Nor does the treaty provide that, once a request for extradition is made, the procedures outlined in the treaty become the sole means of transferring custody of a suspected criminal from one country to the other. Finally, because Kasi was not returned to the United States via extradition proceedings initiated under the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Pakistan, Kasi's reliance upon United States v. Rauscher does not avail him Kasi was executed by lethal injection on November 14, 2002. On February 7, 1995, Pakistani intelligence and U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security Special Agents Bill Miller and Jeff Riner captured Ramzi Ahmed Yousefin Islamabad, Pakistan. Yousef was flown back to the United States where he was convicted of the 1993 bombing of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. This dangerous terrorist, who is the nephew of 9/11 master mind, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is serving a life sentence in an American prison. On March 1, 2003, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence reported that they had captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in a raid in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in a joint raid with the CIA's Special Activities Division paramilitary operatives. Following the report of the capture, some Pakistani officials say he was immediately transferred to U.S. custody without extradition proceedings, while others said he remained in Pakistani custody. Where the rendition became illegal - he was not transported to the United States or to a declared detention center but was sent to a secret prison \u2013 which is a violation of international law. Secret prisons were outlawed by the international community after WWII because the Nazis used to make people disappear without their families or local authorities being informed of the person's situation.",

How does the left reconcile the use of rendition by the Obama administration, where detainees are turned over to governments, like Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, for interrogation? The interrogation tactics that these countries are severe, they maim and scar. The Obama administration has reatined this option, inspite of releasing the \"interrogation memos\", and in effect, drastically set back our ability to collect good intelligence because the enemy knows that nothing will happen to them. In effect, we're condoning more severe \"torture\" for high profile detainees than the EITs ever were. How does the left leaning mind reconcile that? There's nothing to reconcile. It's still there for a reason. Can you figure it out without a lot of wingnut whining? That's not a direct answer, and no one's whining...I leave that to the lefties. So, the current administration says no torture, that it's beneath dignity to do that, but detainees are turned over to governments that do torture, so the the detainees will be tortured to gain intelligence....In effect, the current administration tortures... indirectly. What's wrong, do you find the hypocrisy is getting under your skin? Come on, I'm too easy, remember? How do you explain the hypocrisy? Don't pull a Nancy Pelosi here, let's hear it... How many detainees have been renditioned under Obama's watch?",
