It just goes to demonstrate the effect of human error. The science community has been plagued by politics almost since the beginning, in fact you may say both religion and science were tangled together by the same forces that wanted control (the religious leaders and the Kings), this was thousands of years ago and it is still happening today but in slightly different manners. I am just surprised that the oil companies have not bought up the Patten for any such successful procedures, but apparently that procedure is yet to be found so that could still come. This will turn into either the biggest conspiracy theory of the 21st century or the biggest breakthrough modern man has made to date. I hope the latter, for all our sakes.",

No verifiable research has ever been conducted to show that this 'phenomenon' can be reproduced in any manner. Fusion power has potential, but it is very expensive and has some limitations that are huge obstacles to finding a viable solution. I once took a tour of the Max Planc Institiute for Plasma Physics near Munich. At the time they stated that a working Tokomak was only a year or two away (they had the second largest one), once they solved the metallurgy problems of the inner lining of the device. That was 1978. The problem they expected to solve 'in a year or two' has now stretched past three decades. They STILL haven't found a substance to deal with the huge magnetic and temperature stresses involved. Even when they eventually do, there are other issues still unresolved. It is this very delay of 30-40 years that is the reason shady psuedo-scientists pandering 'cold fusion' get the attention of the mainstream press. It sounds too good to be true as the cost of fusion power spirals higher and higher as the problem of the lining continues to be a stumbling block year after year. Put Cold Fusion in the same pile as the Piltdown Man, Bigfoot, Crop Circles and the alien corpse from Roswell. Sullivan013",
