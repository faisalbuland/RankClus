The only real shame to Carter's Presidency was that he didn't nail those two for treason over that matter.",

You just keep tellin' yourself these delusory things, buddy. Shoot, yeah, mind over matter; unfounded faith in the imaginary, wishin' and hopin'--that'll keep us safe. Like Carter's stupid \"policies.\" Obama's model predecessor showed how delusory he was at the Notre Dame commencement speech in '77. His limp impression of realpolitik encouraged Saviet communists in Afghanistan, communists in Nicaragua, and terrorists in Iran. Now we'll likely see more of similar threats. And it will be entirely on the shoulders of the obamanation and its foolishness. The ONLY way this nation has pulled through tough times has been by developing a strong military. NOTHING else has kept the nation safe. NOTHING. Good intentions are a frickin' joke. When freedom itself is on the line, power must be exercised. Teleprompters don't constitute power or influence.
