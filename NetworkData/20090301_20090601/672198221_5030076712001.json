You didn't hear all this hew and cry about this when Denny Hastert was speaker. who by the way returned to IL almost every weekend, it is my understanding that Pelosi returns to CA less than once a month. Yes she probably \"likes\" the \"perk\" but if she does or not, does it really matter if if fact she does not have a choice?",
