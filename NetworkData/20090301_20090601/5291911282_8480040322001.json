        "content": "Her is the scenario, a special operations team (Navy Seals, Green Berets, Delta Force etc.) after getting intelligence is dispatched by the Pentagon to rescue a group of US diplomats that have been kidnapped and are being held by a group of rebels holding up in a camp located in the Amazon jungles of Venezuela. There assignment is to rescue the hostages and terminate the rebels. The camp is camouflaged with netting and the hostages are being held in a makeshift bamboo holding cage. I know our relationship with dictator Hugo Chavez is non existent but he has reluctantly allowed these rebels to exist in his country but they have no ties to his government. The repercussions of such an operation being conducted in his country could have major implications for the US. The twist to the scene is that the rebels have been tipped off by a leak in our intelligence and have set up an elaborate ambush that kills all but one of our rescue team. I have toyed with the idea of a Halo jump by Navy Seals but I need experienced advice on this subject.I want a scene that can bare the weight of scrutiny. I am so tired of the b*******t coming out of Holly weird. I want a scene with accuracy our military veterans can be proud of. Please submit your idea's and criticisms. Thanks",
