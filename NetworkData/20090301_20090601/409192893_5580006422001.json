As a result of the stimulus money, I've seen new projects proposed or shelved projects get new life. These include projects such as wastewater treatment plant upgrades, bridge rehabilitation, power grid substations. Now, if you're going to complete these projects the right way, there needs to be field investigations, planning, and design before rolling out massive field crews and paying out contractors to perform the work. This is why when the statement the stimulus doesn't take effect until 2010 is accurate. Why would a Water Treatment Plant \"pay out\" millions to dollars to private contractors for distribution system upgrades if engineers are still in the design and planning phase? If you're a municipality and you were allocated $100 million to build a new water treatment plant, the federal government will not write you a one time check of $100 million if most that money won't be needed until the project is actually in construction and cranes, excavators, and pump trucks are on the ground.",
