It's the worlds smallest violin playing My Heart Bleeds for You. When President Clinton and VP Al Gore came to town in 1996 for a campaign stop I delt with the huge crowds just to see them. Even though I voted for Dole. But that was the President and VP. In my town! If Obama were to come to town I'll go see him too. And had Bush and or Cheney showed up, same deal. I may not agree with our nation's leaders but....I respect them.",
