You don't know the victim, who was a loved son, brother and friend. And you don't know the marines either. First of all, two of the marines were buying cocaine. That's illegal no matter who you are. They should be discharged for this alone. Second of all it wasn't a bad area of Long Beach and what the hell does this have to do with snoop dog? Who cares about snoop dog? David called the men standing in front of him so their was a record on his phone, something for the cops to start with. Pretty smart for a \"dead-coke-head.\" There was no money or drugs in the apartment, hence the reason he was shot. And your precious marines werent smart enough to check his truck before entering the apartment. Also for your information, one marine admited and pleaded guilty accepting all charges. The other two pointed fingers anywhere but at themselves, selfish little pigs. One of them was deserting when he was arrested so that he wouldn't have to serve in Iraq. Those are the type of Marines I want protecting my country. Are those the marines your so proud of? Are they so much better then some druggie? You do realize that by buying drugs, which they had been for atleast 3 months, the where druggies too, right? Perhaps you should get all your facts straight before opening your mouth next time. Atleast you wont look like such an idiot.",
