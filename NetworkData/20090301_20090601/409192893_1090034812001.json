We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026.

Cut spending by at least 20%. 2. Cut capital gains. 3. Allow AIG, Automakers to fail. 4. Send 100K troops to A-stand. 5. Balance the budget. 6.

We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026.

        "content": "I read two very long articles yesterday on the details and consequences of the budget deficit. It is VERY ALARMING\u2026 You can check them out here: \u2026http: //www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/11730990-1.html\u2026 \u2026 http: //blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/01/can-the-us-economy-afford-a-keynesian-stimulus/ \u2026and if you copy the above addresses \u2013 there is a \u201cspace\u201d between the semi colon and forward slashes\u2026 According this economist \u2013 the 9-trillion dollar debt is seriously misleading \u2013 it is technically and literally \u2013 $ 56,000,000,000,000.00 - yep, 56-Trillion Dollars\u2026 These articles are well worth the read\u2026 Essentially \u2013 the first article explains why the debt is actually 56-Trillion \u2026 He shows using GOA real-deal numbers that even THEY know it\u2019s true\u2026 Here\u2019s the thing though\u2026 According to these guys \u2013 Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will consume 50% of the Fed budget by 2030\u2026 So, most folks know this and there is time to deal with it\u2026 BUT Here\u2019s a snip from the article\u2026 Elements of the Problem \"There's a real risk that if we don't get our financial house in order, we'll see interest rates go up, which will have a ripple effect on other aspects of the economy,\" Walker warns. \"If we don't reprioritize, restructure and reinvent, the federal tax burden will have to more than double over the next 20 years. We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026. That\u2019s when my mortgage was at a staggering 15.5%... Keep in mind \u2013 he was raising taxes based upon the economy THEN \u2013 NOW within the next 3-5 yrs the federal deficit SEVEN times that amount\u2026 Back in Sept-Oct before the election I said unemployment would be up to 7.5% within a few months if Obama was elected \u2013 it\u2019s 8.6%... but we have NOT even begun to feel the pain of unemployment rising \u2013 not even remotely\u2026 Within the next 12-18 months is when the crunch will ONLY BEGIN!

We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026.

As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026.

It is VERY ALARMING\u2026 You can check them out here: \u2026http: //www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/11730990-1.html\u2026 \u2026 http: //blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/01/can-the-us-economy-afford-a-keynesian-stimulus/ \u2026and if you copy the above addresses \u2013 there is a \u201cspace\u201d between the semi colon and forward slashes\u2026 According this economist \u2013 the 9-trillion dollar debt is seriously misleading \u2013 it is technically and literally \u2013 $ 56,000,000,000,000.00 - yep, 56-Trillion Dollars\u2026 These articles are well worth the read\u2026 Essentially \u2013 the first article explains why the debt is actually 56-Trillion \u2026 He shows using GOA real-deal numbers that even THEY know it\u2019s true\u2026 Here\u2019s the thing though\u2026 According to these guys \u2013 Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will consume 50% of the Fed budget by 2030\u2026 So, most folks know this and there is time to deal with it\u2026 BUT Here\u2019s a snip from the article\u2026 Elements of the Problem \"There's a real risk that if we don't get our financial house in order, we'll see interest rates go up, which will have a ripple effect on other aspects of the economy,\" Walker warns. \"If we don't reprioritize, restructure and reinvent, the federal tax burden will have to more than double over the next 20 years. We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly.

We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026.

We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026. That\u2019s when my mortgage was at a staggering 15.5%... Keep in mind \u2013 he was raising taxes based upon the economy THEN \u2013 NOW within the next 3-5 yrs the federal deficit SEVEN times that amount\u2026 Back in Sept-Oct before the election I said unemployment would be up to 7.5% within a few months if Obama was elected \u2013 it\u2019s 8.6%... but we have NOT even begun to feel the pain of unemployment rising \u2013 not even remotely\u2026 Within the next 12-18 months is when the crunch will ONLY BEGIN! That\u2019s when the unemployment checks start running out for these folks and from there out \u2013 it only gets worse and it does so picking up momentum. All of these people are getting laid off \u2013 WERE paying taxes. NOW they are getting money from the fed-drawer\u2026 That means NEXT YEAR the Fed\u2019s money will be steadily decreasing akin to someone puncturing a three inch hole in the side of an above ground pool. It starts with spurting with pressure then begins to rip until \u2013 you get the picture\u2026 This debt is SO HUGE by the time our grand kids are hoping to buy SOMETHING \u2013 the country won\u2019t even be able to make the payments.

We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself.

It is VERY ALARMING\u2026 You can check them out here: \u2026http: //www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/11730990-1.html\u2026 \u2026 http: //blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/01/can-the-us-economy-afford-a-keynesian-stimulus/ \u2026and if you copy the above addresses \u2013 there is a \u201cspace\u201d between the semi colon and forward slashes\u2026 According this economist \u2013 the 9-trillion dollar debt is seriously misleading \u2013 it is technically and literally \u2013 $ 56,000,000,000,000.00 - yep, 56-Trillion Dollars\u2026 These articles are well worth the read\u2026 Essentially \u2013 the first article explains why the debt is actually 56-Trillion \u2026 He shows using GOA real-deal numbers that even THEY know it\u2019s true\u2026 Here\u2019s the thing though\u2026 According to these guys \u2013 Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will consume 50% of the Fed budget by 2030\u2026 So, most folks know this and there is time to deal with it\u2026 BUT Here\u2019s a snip from the article\u2026 Elements of the Problem \"There's a real risk that if we don't get our financial house in order, we'll see interest rates go up, which will have a ripple effect on other aspects of the economy,\" Walker warns. \"If we don't reprioritize, restructure and reinvent, the federal tax burden will have to more than double over the next 20 years. We will pass a tipping point in about 20 years where this just spins out of control.\" The numbers beyond the spin-out are not pretty. The U.S. Treasury's 2007 Guide to Understanding the Annual Financial Report of the United States shows, in Chart A, \"Current Trends Are Not Sustainable,\" reports that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for half the federal budget by 2030; but not for long. Fifteen years later, interest will exceed the cost of Social Security; and 30 years later, interest will consume nothing less than half of America's gross domestic product. Thus, the question for today's financial executives is whether their companies can sustain the economic stress brought on by that unsustainable federal deficit. Walker's warnings are replete with signs of danger for American businesses. At some point, if nothing changes the current course, foreign investors who currently pay interest on the federal debt may realize that the U.S. may not be able to pay back what it owes. Only higher interest rates would balance that perceived risk enough to continue to attract investment. Domestic interest rates must react accordingly. As the value of the dollar plummets, the cost of imported goods soars, and the nation's current account tilts precipitously. As more of the federal budget goes to finance the swelling debt, less will go to maintenance and improvement of the national infrastructure. As communication, transportation and energy production become less efficient, the economy will perform less well than projected. As tax revenues decline, the problem starts to feed itself. And down we go. In about 20 years, Walker explains, the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will reach third-world status. Michael E. Lewitt, president of Capital Management LLC, says the current Wall Street crisis and impending government fiscal crisis are linked, with the government's increasing thirst for borrowed money slamming up against the financial industry's need for capital. ----------end --- snip ---------- Obama was going to raise taxes to same height as the Carter years\u2026. That\u2019s when my mortgage was at a staggering 15.5%... Keep in mind \u2013 he was raising taxes based upon the economy THEN \u2013 NOW within the next 3-5 yrs the federal deficit SEVEN times that amount\u2026 Back in Sept-Oct before the election I said unemployment would be up to 7.5% within a few months if Obama was elected \u2013 it\u2019s 8.6%... but we have NOT even begun to feel the pain of unemployment rising \u2013 not even remotely\u2026 Within the next 12-18 months is when the crunch will ONLY BEGIN! That\u2019s when the unemployment checks start running out for these folks and from there out \u2013 it only gets worse and it does so picking up momentum. All of these people are getting laid off \u2013 WERE paying taxes. NOW they are getting money from the fed-drawer\u2026 That means NEXT YEAR the Fed\u2019s money will be steadily decreasing akin to someone puncturing a three inch hole in the side of an above ground pool. It starts with spurting with pressure then begins to rip until \u2013 you get the picture\u2026 This debt is SO HUGE by the time our grand kids are hoping to buy SOMETHING \u2013 the country won\u2019t even be able to make the payments. How long will China hold out before they start taking action or instigating Chavez along with the Soviets by then comfy cozy in Cuba\u2026? Maybe that\u2019s a little too far-fetched \u2013 most of us won\u2019t be here to find out. Hope everyone gets to take their kids and grandkids to Disneyland before too long\u2026 at least there will be some memories\u2026 The 110th Congress that destroyed the American and ended the great experiment. They traded their freedom for their socialist fantasies\u2026 what a disgrace they are \u2013 and that is ALL of them BOTH sides of the isles \u2013 REPUBLICAN & DEMOCRAT\u2026.
