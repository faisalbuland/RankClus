Do they help stop the flow of illegal aliens passing though their borders to get to ours? How about the \u201cdeath squads\u201d that seems to do what ever they want?!

It has some issues with crime in general, organized crime, and especially drug lords/gangs, so it's accepted help from us in the form of helicopters and training and so forth in combating that. However, U.S. policy has for the past 15 or 20 years been one of benign neglect, in regards to most countries south of our border. In light of this vacuum, regional personalities like Hugo Chavez have begun to have a larger influence on the populations of neighboring countries, including Columbia. That guy's influential because his country has oil, and he's pretty adamantly anti-U.S., though I suspect this stance is largely status or attention-seeking. There aren't terribly many illegal immigrants from south of Central America, statistically speaking. I mean, there's some, of course, just not terribly many. That's all I got from my semi-regular reading of and listening to the international news and a short tourist visit to Argentina, as far as Columbia goes.",
