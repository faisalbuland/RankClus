Honostly, where are only near the end of a long chain of events that started before any of us here drew breath. And if the pace of things accelerates any more than they are currently moving we will see many unfortunate episodes in out time while America does one of three things: 1) Rebuilds itself into a more perfect union where the rights of the people and states are restored and the power of the federal government diminished. 2) Enters into a civil war either politicallyor with arms, including possible attempts by states to leave the Union, the end result of which is anybodies guess at this time. 3) The federal government totally and wholely subjugates the people and states, and the Constitution treated as no more than a \"piece of paper\" if not completely rewritten to affirm the federal governments currently entrenched position of power, with all the abuses and potential abuses related to such a situation. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake.

I'm willing to bet a shiny sixpence that they would be appalled by the current level of federal power and would disapprove of it most strongly. Honostly, where are only near the end of a long chain of events that started before any of us here drew breath. And if the pace of things accelerates any more than they are currently moving we will see many unfortunate episodes in out time while America does one of three things: 1) Rebuilds itself into a more perfect union where the rights of the people and states are restored and the power of the federal government diminished. 2) Enters into a civil war either politicallyor with arms, including possible attempts by states to leave the Union, the end result of which is anybodies guess at this time. 3) The federal government totally and wholely subjugates the people and states, and the Constitution treated as no more than a \"piece of paper\" if not completely rewritten to affirm the federal governments currently entrenched position of power, with all the abuses and potential abuses related to such a situation.",

Yup that's what I see coming and who ever the President is at that time has a sworn duty to ensure the union stays together. I can see Alaska jumping on this with Texas real soon. Unfortunately Lewis, What you may not understand is the Prior Admin and those policies have already threatened our way of life. So I am not sure what other ways your talking about. Unless it's guns or something like that. Americans no longer have the opportunity to just work and make a living wage to raise a decent family in this nation, a very basic way of life I would say. Talk like this coming from a U.S. Governor, a head of a state in this union is indeed extreme.",

Wish I could find who said it but it describes the government perfectly, \u201cThe bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy\u201d. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake.
