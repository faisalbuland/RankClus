What Claire Sweeney made of U.S. President Bill Clinton's chat up lines quote: TV presenter Claire Sweeney has revealed she was chatted up by Bill Clinton at a fancy dress party. The former Brookside star was at a bash in Russia, hosted by Cliff Richard, when Clinton, who was U.S. President at the time, approached her, dressed as an admiral. Sweeney, who was at the party with her then-boyfriend businessman Tony Hibbard, told Channel Five\u2019s The Wright Stuff: \u2018Clinton came over and started chatting me up. \u2018I thought: \u201cYou dirty dog\u201d. 'His bodyguard then came over and said: \u201cMr President, we need to go\u201d.\u2019 However, Clinton managed to shake off his bodyguard and swiftly made a beeline back to Sweeney, who was dressed in a saucy Dangerous Liaisons-style outfit. The 37-year-old asked him: \u2018You don\u2019t want to go, do you? 'He said \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d \u2018I said \u201cBecause your left leg is dancing\u201d.\u2019 To which 62-year-old Clinton is alleged to have responded: \u2018My middle leg will be dancing soon!\u2019 Sweeney, who played Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago, joked: \u2018I shook his hand but decided I was going home with a clean dress that night!\u2019",
