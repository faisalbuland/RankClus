        "content": "The White House's \"full support.\" The backing of Senate leadership. The promise to retain his rank. Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter appeared to gain a new political world for leaving the party that brought him to national politics. One week later, that world is gone. Specter now stands alone. Stripped of his rank by Democrats. Scorned by Republicans. Specter's flash of strength has turned to weakness. That weakness was thrown into stark relief Wednesday night, as Rep. Joe Sestak said in an interview that he was \"very seriously\" considering challenging Specter in the Democratic primary. There was a renewed energy to Sestak, repeating the phrase \"very seriously\" as he drove from Washington DC to Pittsburgh. It was only last week that Sestak appeared blindsided. \"You know,\" Sestak told MSNBC's Chris Matthews Friday with a pang of resignation, \"I was thinking of getting in. And I haven't made my final decision.\" How quickly the winds have changed. Barack Obama was handed a political gift on his 100th day in office. A moderate Republican came to the White House to offer his Democratic allegiance and potentially an invincible legislative majority. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden received Specter publicly, courting live coverage on the cable networks. It was a celebration. President Obama told Specter he would campaign for him. Obama offered his \"full support,\" a pledge reiterated by top White House officials. Specter was to be no \"rubber stamp.\" But the exchange was implicit. On some big bills, perhaps health care, Specter could offer the scale-tipping 60th vote. Obama would avoid contentious procedural maneuvers. In return, Specter was to keep his veteran status and win the mighty Democratic leadership\u2019s favor. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put it plainly to National Journal reporters on Friday. Specter, Reid said, \"will maintain his overall seniority in the Senate and its pretty clear that he's going to do that.\" Soon even that allegiance came into question. This week Specter told the New York Times that Republican Norm Coleman should be seated over his Democratic opponent Al Franken, in Minnesota's still disputed Senate race. \"Arlen,\" Reid asked Specter on the Senate floor. \"What's going on here?\" \"I forgot what team I was on,\" Specter replied. Tuesday night, the Senate voted to strip Specter of his seniority. Specter has served in the Senate for twenty nine years. The vote left him with the power of a freshman. Specter responded Wednesday morning with a written statement, again noting Reid's promise that \"I would have the same seniority as if I had been elected as a Democrat in 1980.\" Rest Here: \"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/05/07/dems_shun_specter_undercut_obama_and_reid_96381.html\" \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
