Fortunately, I was 30 years old before I entered college and had already spent more than a decade in the Army, so I refused to accept much of the BS that is spoon fed to university students. The more we spend on our schools and our kids' \"education\" - the dumber and less informed they seem to get. About the only education they receive is acceptance of \"politically correct\" behavior as mandated by our amoral government and educational officials.",

I think the dumbing down of Americans is a deliberate move on the part of our masters to gain total control of the populace. Some of the things happening in our public schools are unbelievable. The aim of public education is to make homogenized serfs out of our youth. I have long advocated the abolishment of public education in this country. Public schools are mere holding pens for many antisocial kids, institutions designed to indoctrinate America's youth. Those parents who truly want their children to be properly educated will form their own \"schools\". My father had only six years of formal education, but he was one of the most intelligent and clear thinking persons I have ever know due to his incessant curiousity, self education and rejection of the trivial nonsense fed to us by our government and its controlled media. I have a masters but acknowledge how worthless was much of the \"indoctrination\" I received from my professors. Fortunately, I was 30 years old before I entered college and had already spent more than a decade in the Army, so I refused to accept much of the BS that is spoon fed to university students. The more we spend on our schools and our kids' \"education\" - the dumber and less informed they seem to get. About the only education they receive is acceptance of \"politically correct\" behavior as mandated by our amoral government and educational officials.",

I had not been able to find this test!!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! NOW maybe my \"detractors\" can see I'm not full of sheep dip!!! Thanks again!!!.......Tawodi You are very welcome my friend. Is this what they mean by being \"Old School\"?. If so I like it.", 
        "reply": " I think the dumbing down of Americans is a deliberate move on the part of our masters to gain total control of the populace. Some of the things happening in our public schools are unbelievable. The aim of public education is to make homogenized serfs out of our youth. I have long advocated the abolishment of public education in this country. Public schools are mere holding pens for many antisocial kids, institutions designed to indoctrinate America's youth. Those parents who truly want their children to be properly educated will form their own \"schools\". My father had only six years of formal education, but he was one of the most intelligent and clear thinking persons I have ever know due to his incessant curiousity, self education and rejection of the trivial nonsense fed to us by our government and its controlled media. I have a masters but acknowledge how worthless was much of the \"indoctrination\" I received from my professors. Fortunately, I was 30 years old before I entered college and had already spent more than a decade in the Army, so I refused to accept much of the BS that is spoon fed to university students. The more we spend on our schools and our kids' \"education\" - the dumber and less informed they seem to get. About the only education they receive is acceptance of \"politically correct\" behavior as mandated by our amoral government and educational officials.",

Latin does have six tenses (six changes in the spelling of the verb), but English really only has two: Present and Past (run/ran). English created all its notions of \"time/tense\" with word combinations of present and past rather than spelling changes: could have been going to go, might have gone, has gone, was gone - - So a great deal of that memorization was time wasted on misinformation. I know this to be true from arguing nose to nose with professors and teaching \"English\" for 30+ years - - There are some bare-bones Grammar Principles that need to be mastered to communicate effectively: Start a sentence with a capital; end with a period; learn the use of conjunctions, adverbial connectives, and semi-colons; know how adjectives, prepositional phrases, and dependent clauses work, and avoid dangling modifiers, etc.; and so on...up through parallelism, paragraph writing; and the creation of academic papers, epistles, and creative works of quality - - All of which can be contained for the High School student in about a 20 page guide book - - My point is that today, there is such a vast amount of things the average 8th Grader is supposed to know a great deal about that it is mind-boggling...

        "content": "A point if I may. I pull duty as a substitute teacher, both my parents were teachers as were two of my grandmothers. I got this test in an email several years ago and was amazed at how little of it I knew. I showed it to my grandfather and he didn't miss any of them. Now the reason for my post. I have been subing for about two years now, and in that short time I have seen the curiculum watered down time and again, hell even compared to what it was when I was in school the subject matter is constantly reduced in quality and content with more emphasis on doing well on standardized test that have no bearing on actual student or teacher performance. With the basics, the old \"Three R's\" so to speak, a student can accomplish far more than if they only recieve a broad overview of many subjects. Honostly, we need to return to a more intense focus on basics, bring back the red ink, and show students what is actually needed in the real world. Some school systems have bans on failing grades and the use of red ink by teachers as it is \"hrmfull to students self esteem\", news flash, the real world doesn't give two bits about that, only if you can or cannot do the assigned job.

        "reply": "A point if I may. I pull duty as a substitute teacher, both my parents were teachers as were two of my grandmothers. I got this test in an email several years ago and was amazed at how little of it I knew. I showed it to my grandfather and he didn't miss any of them. Now the reason for my post. I have been subing for about two years now, and in that short time I have seen the curiculum watered down time and again, hell even compared to what it was when I was in school the subject matter is constantly reduced in quality and content with more emphasis on doing well on standardized test that have no bearing on actual student or teacher performance. With the basics, the old \"Three R's\" so to speak, a student can accomplish far more than if they only recieve a broad overview of many subjects. Honostly, we need to return to a more intense focus on basics, bring back the red ink, and show students what is actually needed in the real world. Some school systems have bans on failing grades and the use of red ink by teachers as it is \"hrmfull to students self esteem\", news flash, the real world doesn't give two bits about that, only if you can or cannot do the assigned job.

True \"Tense\" is a spelling change (sit/sat) not a notional (idea) change. The ONLY way you can obtain the notion/idea of \"future tense\" in English is two combine to \"present tense\" verbs: will (present) run (present) = will run (notion of future, but not a true tense/spelling change). Yup, I've argued those concepts with college professors, and I'm right. When \"English\" (Angle/Saxon German)went through its \"slave period\" after the 1066 conquest of Briton by the French-Speaking Normans until about 1300, only the uneducated, lower class peasants spoke it as a vulgar (common) language. The upper class spoke/wrote French and Latin. Because \"Anglish\" was not written or studied, it went through enormous modifications, including dropping of rigorous spelling changes for tense/time changes. They gave way to syntax (word order - subject/verb/object) and word combination changes (verb phrases, prepositional phrases, dependent clause phrases) which could be learned/understood/memorized by ear - as in singing of songs or reciting poems - - This streamlined Anglish/English oral grammar a great deal, but when England separated from Europe as a Power under Henry the VIII, suddenly there was an over-weaning need to put English on the same level of the Great Languages of Europe to make England Great! So, Latin Grammar was superimposed, even though it didn't fit. Dictionaries were attempted and finally created (Samuel Johnson). And English/England became the Empire of the World - but the language had three major problems: It was not an original language, but actually a combination of German, French, and Latin. All their Grammars and spellings are floating around all over in it, creating one problem after another (Celtic forms having been completely ignored). Lastly, it is an eclectic language that will drink up whatever wanders past (canoe, tomato, kung fu, byte). - - So what do we do? Do what we do best - play it by ear!! By the way, computers can learn English faster than other languages, because of the simple, mathematical word-order grammar: noun+verb+noun/adjective/adverb=sentence - Sam drives truck; Sam is sleepy; Sam drives poorly.
