A recent study of 368 officers and enlisted personnel in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps found that 20.1 percent personally know a homosexual service member; another 22.3 percent are unsure as to whether they know a homosexual service member. If these figures are extrapolated to the entire armed forces, then approximately 301,500 service members personally know a homosexual peer, and approximately 334,500 service members are unsure as to whether they personally know a homosexual peer. Other studies show the same thing. Finally, nothing will change in the shower after the lifting of the ban. Even though service members are already showering next to peers whom they know to be gay, the experiences of foreign militaries as well as domestic police and fire departments show that very few additional homosexuals will reveal their sexual orientation after the lifting of the ban. Hence, nothing will change in the shower after the lifting of the ban. \u201cIf heterosexual soldiers are constantly worried about being looked at in the shower by gay soldiers, they will either quit the armed forces or retaliate against gay soldiers.\u201d Canada and Britain wrongly predicted that service members would quit after the lifting of gay bans. In a 1985 survey of 6,500 male soldiers, the Canadian Department of National Defence found that 62% of male service members would refuse to share showers, undress or sleep in the same room as a gay soldier, and that 45% would refuse to work with gays. A 1996 survey of 13,500 British service members reported that two-thirds of male respondents would not willingly serve in the military if gays and lesbians were allowed to serve. Yet when Canada and Britain lifted their gay bans, no more than a handful of people retired. \u201cWhat happens if openly gay soldiers come onto a straight soldier in the showers? What happens if gay soldiers hit on each other?\u201d This has not been a problem in foreign militaries that lifted their gay bans. Foreign militaries have found that by holding all service members to the same standards, inappropriate conduct is very rare, and that when it happens, it can be disciplined in an even-handed way. Inappropriate displays of affection by all personnel are covered in the Code of Conduct. \u201cAnyone who has served in combat knows that battlefield conditions are not conducive for heterosexual soldiers serving alongside openly gay soldiers. Soldiers sometimes share body heat - those necessities couldn\u2019t happen if a soldier believed someone was sexually aroused by such contact.\u201d The British and Canadian militaries predicted that cohesion would deteriorate if gays and lesbians were allowed to serve openly, but even senior experts and officials who had predicted such deterioration are now unable to point to any problems whatsoever. In the Israeli military, a recent survey found that approximately 20% of combat soldiers know a gay peer in their unit. We can\u2019t risk introducing romantic liaisons of any kind in war. What would happen if a gay soldier saw his lover injured on the battlefield?\u201d The 24 foreign military forces that have lifted their bans, as well as the FBI, NSA, CIA, Secret Service, as well as police and fire departments that have lifted their bans, have found that gay and lesbian soldiers are just as loyal as everyone else, and that romantic liaisons are not a major problem. \u201cWhat about [incident X] in Iraq, in which a gay British soldier compromised unit cohesion? And yet anecdotes about disciplinary problems concerning members of other groups do not mean that an entire group of people must be fired. If a Korean-American soldier undermined his unit\u2019s cohesion, the military would not fire all Korean American service members. Isolated problems are nothing new, and the question is not whether the lifting of a gay ban might lead to a few, isolated problems. The point, rather, is whether the lifting of a gay ban has an overall impact on unit cohesion. And the evidence from 24 foreign militaries is that the lifting of a gay ban is a non-event that has no impact on performance. For a concrete example of this, read Out Sailors Recount Iraq War Experiences Alongside US Troops \u201cDo you have any evidence from the foreign militaries that openly gay soldiers actually do serve in openly integrated units with straight soldiers? Isn\u2019t it true with these other countries that gays stay in the closet anyway?\u201d In the case of Israel, for example, Professor Charles Moskos, one of the principle architects of \u201cDon\u2019t-Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in 1993 that known gay soldiers were not assigned to elite combat units, did not work for intelligence units, and did not hold command positions in any branch of the Israel Defense Forces. In later work, Moskos reaffirmed that \u201cgays are excluded from elite combat units, and most sleep at their own homes rather than in barracks\u201d. During two appearances on National Public Radio, Moskos said that there are no gay soldiers in combat or intelligence units of the IDF who are out of the closet. To test whether Moskos\u2019s claims were accurate, the University of California administered a survey in 2000 to soldiers in 17 the Israel Defense Forces that included the question: \u201cDo you know (or have known in the past) a homosexual or lesbian soldier in your unit\u201d? Of the 194 combat soldiers who responded, 42 (21.6%) responded that they know a homosexual peer in their combat unit, and 38 (19.6%) responded that they might know a homosexual peer in their combat unit. The percentages were almost equivalent for non-combat troops. To the extent that these results can be extrapolated, then roughly 28,000 of Israel\u2019s 130,000 active duty land forces know a gay peer in their unit. Even in combat and intelligence units with known gay soldiers, however, a recent, comprehensive study published in the prestigious journal Armed Forces and Society found no evidence of a deterioration in cohesion, performance, readiness or morale. Generals, ministry officials, scholars, and NGO observers all have claimed that their presence has not eroded cohesion, performance, readiness or morale. Gay bashing - You can\u2019t expect these boys to accept open homosexuals overnight.\u201d In Britain, none of the twenty-five experts, officials, activists, and service members interviewed for a recent University of California report knew of a single case of gay-bashing or assault related to sexual orientation after the lifting of the ban. One military official reported that there have been no incidents related to sexual orientation reported to his office since the ban was lifted. He added: \u201cThe change in policy has been a complete non-event.\u201d Comparisons with Racial Integration \u201cSkin color is a benign, non-behavioral characteristic. Sexual orientation is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics. Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument. Blacks do not choose to be black, but gays can choose not to act gay.\u201d The question isn\u2019t whether race is biological and sexuality is chosen or whether racial difference is benign while differences in sexuality are not, but whether lifting the gay ban would undermine military effectiveness. In fact, many experts believe that sexuality is chosen for some people and biologically determined for others. But again, the origin of sexuality is not what\u2019s important. What matters is whether lifting the gay ban undermines the military. And the evidence shows decisively that it does not. \u201cWhy do gay soldiers have to tell other soldiers that they are gay?\u201d The answer to the question is simple: honour and integrity. Whether we mean to or not, all of us regularly ask questions that make assumptions about sexuality: \u201cAre you married?\u201d \u201cDo you think she\u2019s attractive?\u201d \u201cWho are you taking to the dining in night / ball / social?\u201d There is no way for gay servicemen to answer such ordinary questions without pretending to be straight oradmitting they are gay. Gay and lesbian service members do not seek the right to \u201cflaunt\u201d their identity or put their sexuality above the interests of the military. What they do seek, however, is the same right every other soldier has: to say who they are honestly and honorably, without getting fired or beaten up. It is just as unrealistic and dishonorable to expect gay soldiers to constantly lie about themselves to their civilian friends as to their military peers. \"Have there been any anecdotal problems of integrating to open service in other countries?\u201d Even the leading opponents of allowing gays and lesbians into foreign militaries believe that the lifting of the bans did not damage the armed forces. Professor Christopher Dandeker, one of Britain\u2019s most distinguished military experts, predicted that the lifting of UK\u2019s gay ban would undermine the military. He has since concluded, however, that integration has not caused any problems. An internal government report that appraised the British change in policy characterized it as a \u201csolid achievement \u2026 with fewer problems than might have been expected.\u201d The assistant chief of the navy staff, Rear- Admiral James Burnell-Nugent concurred, \u201cAlthough some did not welcome the change in policy, it has not caused any degree of difficulty.\u201d Overall, the report suggests that \u201cthere has been a marked lack of reaction\u201d to the issue of including homosexual personnel in the British Armed Services. In Australia, for example, spokesmen for the Returned and Services League, the country\u2019s largest veterans\u2019 group, predicted that lifting the gay ban would jeopardize morale and military performance. Eight years after Australia\u2019s 1992 decision to lift its ban, however, the President of the Returned and Services League, Major General Peter Philips, stated that gays in the military have \u201cnot been a significant public issue. The Defence Forces have not had a lot of difficulty in this area.\u201d Commodore R.W. Gates, whose rank is equivalent to a one-star admiral, remarked that the lifting of the ban was \u201can absolute non-event.\u201d Professor Hugh Smith, a leading academicexpert on homosexuality in the Australian military, observed that when the government ordered the military to lift theban, some officers said, \u201cOver my dead body, if this happens I\u2019ll resign.\u201d However, Smith said that there were nodepartures and that the change was accepted in \u201ctrue military tradition.\u201d Bronwen Grey, an official in the Australian Defence Ministry reported, \u201c[T]here was no increase in complaints about gay people or by gay people. There was noknown increase in fights, on a ship, or in Army units or something \u2026 The recruitment figures didn\u2019t alter.\u201d In Canada, Steve Leveque, a civilian official in the Department of National Defence, commented that including gays and lesbians in the Canadian Forces is \u201cnot that big a deal for us \u2026 On a day-to-day basis there probably hasn\u2019t been much of a change.\u201d A 1995 internal report from the Canadian government on the lifting of the ban concluded, \u201cDespite all the anxiety that existed through the late 80s into the early 90s about the change in policy, here\u2019s what the indicators show\u2013 no effect.\u201d In Israel, Stuart Cohen, a Professor at the Center for Strategic Studies who is recognized as a leading expert on the Israel Defense Forces, remarked, \u201cAs far as I have been able to tell, homosexuals do not constitute an issue [with respect to] unit cohesion in the IDF. In fact, the entire subject is very marginal indeed as far as this military is concerned.\u201d Reuven Gal, the director of the Israeli Institute for Military Studies, wrote, \u201cAccording to military reports, [homosexuals\u2019] presence, whether openly or clandestinely, has not impaired the morale, cohesion, readiness, or security of any unit.\u201d In over 100 interviews conducted by University of California researchers with both pro-gay and anti-gay experts, not one expert informant believed that the Australian, Canadian, Israeli, or British decisions to lift their gay bans undermined military performance, readiness or cohesion, led to increased difficulties in recruiting or retention, or increased the rate of HIV infection among the troops. \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that no foreign military has conducted rigorous internal reviews of open service 5+ years after changing their policies?\u201d The reason the foreign militaries tend not to conduct ongoing internal reviews is that early inquiries, when problems should be most apparent, uncover so few problems that these organizations conclude that there is no reason to conduct additional research. In 1995, for example, the Section Head for Human Rights Policy, a bureau of the Canadian Department of National Defence, prepared a memo on the lifting of the gay ban. His conclusion was that \u201cDespite all the anxiety that existed through the late 80s into the early 90s about the change in policy, here\u2019s what the indicators show\u2013 no effect.\u201d In Britain, the military\u2019s own comprehensive, internal assessment at six months found that there were no indications of negative effects on recruiting levels, no mass resignations, no major reported cases of gay-bashing or harassment of sexual minorities, no major reported cases of harassment or inappropriate behavior by gay or lesbian soldiers, and no perceived effect on morale, unit cohesion or operational effectiveness. The classified report was not intended for a civilian audience, and was not written with an eye toward shifting public opinion or influencing policy debates. It concluded that the policy change produced a \u201cmarked lack of reaction.\u201d In Australia, Bronwen Grey, a Defence Ministry official responsible for monitoring the effects of the lifting of the ban reported 8 years after the policy change that \u201c[T]here was no increase in complaints about gay people or by gay people. There was no known increase in fights, on a ship, or in Army units or something \u2026 The recruitment figures didn\u2019t alter.\u201d Unbiased, external reviewers conclude exactly the same thing as these internal reports: the lifting of a gay ban does not undermine the military. The Rand Corporation, which is not a liberal or gay organization, concluded on the basis of its multi-million dollar study that lifting the gay ban would not undermine cohesion in the US military. The Harvard University journal International Security, which is the most prestigious journal in the field of military studies, published a peer-reviewed 1998 study concluding lifting the ban would not undermine cohesion. \"Should HIV+ positive soldiers be able to continue to serve?\u201d Some would argue that HIV+ service members should not be allowed to serve in combat or combat-support roles, but that they should be allowed to serve in administrative capacities that do not entail the possibility of exposure. \u201dShould transsexuals be able to serve in the armed services, too?\u201d Some would argue that anyone who is capable of doing a good job and who is willing to follow orders should be allowed to serve. >http://www.proud2serve.net/lifestyle/faq.htm This message has been edited.

        "content": "I was going to honestly attempt to read this entire post but after the first couple of paragraphs I have clearly witnessed, \"fallicious narrative,\" there's an official name for it that escapes me now, but it is when a piece is written, stringing together bits of information, arranged in an order to appear to make a valid point (which in reality is unfounded). At first glance it sounds good to the uniformed but upon further inspection it's nonsense like that rediculous article written by the rear admiral ... *** Jumping from, \"[...] I should not have to expose my body to a gay man in the shower [...],\" to, \"[...] heterosexuals are already exposing their bodies to gays in the shower [...],\" to, \"[...]A recent study [...] found that 20.1 percent personally know a homosexual service member [...].\" *** 1.) Heterosexual concern. 2.) Stated fact(s) regarding current breaches of the Right to Privacy currently exploited by a disregard for sexual harassment policies based on Federal EEOC regulations, otherwise set to protect folks against sex discrimination. 3.) Then the fallicious kicker. Follow-up with some long-winded narrative about a Poll conducted regarding, \"know[ing] a homesexual service member,\" as if this has anything directly to do with community, \"berthing, bathing, or bowls.\" 4.)

Heterosexual concern. 2.)

        "content": "Very good Jim! Certainly the two military bases I have been working at the past 16 years have made huge inroads to \"privacy\" in building some very impressive quarters for solders and airmen! In my days aboard an old ocean-going tug in the CG (1960s) about 40 of us slept in one berthing area, some stacked five high in ancient canvas racks, no one would have given any thought to ask for privacy! So today's standards sometimes surprise me.... they even have outside private entrances to apartment like settings for even the lowly of the low E's! Very nice! I have heard no complaints or even concerns from active duty people concerning this \"privacy\" (aka \"shower) issue though I know it there among a few. Only the vets. bring it up from time to time but the active duty generally dismiss it as irrelevant and much of that is due to the logic you so politely point out to those who would compel people to \"confess\" their sexual orientation against their will. If a gay service member wants to 'announce' their sexual preferences, so be it, but only of their own volition. That's personal privacy. I hope it goes well for our armed services personnel who happen to be gay. This was an issue I paid very little attention to until three years ago. Since then I have been very impressed with the quality of the gay/lesbian service members I have met, both active and veterans. Thanks! RT",

RT I never had the pleasure of sleeping in one of those old canvas racks but there were a few of them still on the USS Oriskany when I served aboard her. One of my shipmates that slept on a canvas rack told me that he had to adjust the straps frequently in order to keep it tight enough to sleep in. The sagging canvas would keep him from rolling out of the rack during \"High Winds & Heavy Seas\", so it served an additional purpose (smile). I had to put an extra pillow between me and the edge of the metal rack to keep my body anchored to the mattress on those nights when the seas were not cooperating with us. I've always seen the military as an adaptive organization where change is a constant part of military life. Most of us found it a challenging environment and we adjusted quickly to diversity. We dealt with personal issues & biases at the local level and protected our own, meaning we kept it in house. Like you, during my time in the military we were not concerned with nor thought of privacy as being some inalienable right, anyone who'd complain about such foolishness would have been given additional duties to help occupy his overactive imagination. The military recognizes that the younger generation will more readily join and stay in the military if they are provided the same comforts as they'd receive in the civilian community. A private apartment style barracks was the ideal solution. What surprises me is how far along they are in switching to the new OnePlusOne barracks, I knew they were trudging along with the project but it hadn't crossed my mind that they were 60% complete back in 2005. The base near where I live has modern apartment style barracks and it's a training base, so I should have guessed if a training base has the new style, then the regular military installations ought to be close to finishing also. It's a pleasure reading your energized posts. Respectfully, Jim",
