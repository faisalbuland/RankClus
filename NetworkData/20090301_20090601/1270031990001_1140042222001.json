Well, think about it, you have read this and are immediately prepared to call me a crackpot and dismiss everything I have written here aren't you........I rest my case. T First off, Bruce, I don't consider you a \"crackpot\". I may (and often do) disagree with you on purely political matters, but I am willing to \"tolerate\" your views. But that's the point here, I believe. When is tolerance acceptable? When is intolerance acceptable? If it is acceptable to be intolerant of another's views on same sex civil unions (based on your personal religious beliefs), is it also acceptable for a Roman Catholic to be intolerant of a Protestant (based on the Catholic's religious beliefs, articulated by the present Pope's pronouncement that only Roman Catholics are true Christians and all other Christian denominations are flawed) and is it acceptable for the Roman Catholic to write laws to make it a criminal offense to attend an Protestant religious service? I don't smoke tobacco - but I tolerate those who do and question those who feel that smoking tobacco should be criminalized in order to protect smokers from themselves. Does that make me a \"bad\" person because I am not intolerant of tobacco smokers? I am very much a libertarian on social issues - live and let live as long as your actions don't harm others and if you did something wrong in this life, God will judge you and deal with you accordingly. I guess in the eyes of the American Family Association that means I am an agent of Satan, doing my best to destroy the United States.",

Her comments were in response to a question posed to Miss California Carrie Prejean in the April 19 Miss USA Pageant. Homosexual celeblogger Perez Hilton was the pageant judge who asked Prejean her opinion of same-sex marriage, to which she responded that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Outraged by her response, Hilton began blasting the beauty queen and asked for celebrities to share their thoughts on gay marriage. Miley Cyrus responded to Hilton through her Twitter.com account with the following comments: \u2022 \"Everyone deserves to love and be loved and most importantly smile.\" \u2022 \"Jesus loves you and your partner and wants you to know how much he cares! That's like a daddy not loving his lil boy cuz he's gay and that is wrong and very sad! \u2022 \"Like I said everyone deserves to be happy.\" \u2022 \"God\u2019s greatest commandment is to love. And judging is not loving.\" \u2022 \"I am a Christian and I love you - gay or not - because you are no different than anyone else! We are all God's children.\" Such statements will send the wrong message to our children who are influenced by this teenage megastar. Parents need to realize that Cyrus is not the positive role model she was once thought to be. Take action Send Miley Cyrus a letter stating that you do not approve of her comments. Clearly she is confused and does not understand the Bible. Please pray for the Lord to open her eyes to the truth. Doctor of Child Psychology and former Fuehrer of Focus On The Family James Dobson, in 1996, on his radio show: quote: Tolerance is a kind of a desensitization to evil of all varieties. Everything has become acceptable to those who are tolerant",

Homosexual celeblogger Perez Hilton was the pageant judge who asked Prejean her opinion of same-sex marriage, to which she responded that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Outraged by her response, Hilton began blasting the beauty queen and asked for celebrities to share their thoughts on gay marriage. Miley Cyrus responded to Hilton through her Twitter.com account with the following comments: \u2022 \"Everyone deserves to love and be loved and most importantly smile.\" \u2022 \"Jesus loves you and your partner and wants you to know how much he cares! That's like a daddy not loving his lil boy cuz he's gay and that is wrong and very sad! \u2022 \"Like I said everyone deserves to be happy.\" \u2022 \"God\u2019s greatest commandment is to love. And judging is not loving.\" \u2022 \"I am a Christian and I love you - gay or not - because you are no different than anyone else! We are all God's children.\" Such statements will send the wrong message to our children who are influenced by this teenage megastar. Parents need to realize that Cyrus is not the positive role model she was once thought to be. Take action Send Miley Cyrus a letter stating that you do not approve of her comments. Clearly she is confused and does not understand the Bible. Please pray for the Lord to open her eyes to the truth.",

But that's the point here, I believe. When is tolerance acceptable? When is intolerance acceptable? If it is acceptable to be intolerant of another's views on same sex civil unions (based on your personal religious beliefs), is it also acceptable for a Roman Catholic to be intolerant of a Protestant (based on the Catholic's religious beliefs, articulated by the present Pope's pronouncement that only Roman Catholics are true Christians and all other Christian denominations are flawed) and is it acceptable for the Roman Catholic to write laws to make it a criminal offense to attend an Protestant religious service? I don't smoke tobacco - but I tolerate those who do and question those who feel that smoking tobacco should be criminalized in order to protect smokers from themselves. Does that make me a \"bad\" person because I am not intolerant of tobacco smokers? I am very much a libertarian on social issues - live and let live as long as your actions don't harm others and if you did something wrong in this life, God will judge you and deal with you accordingly. I guess in the eyes of the American Family Association that means I am an agent of Satan, doing my best to destroy the United States.",

Well, think about it, you have read this and are immediately prepared to call me a crackpot and dismiss everything I have written here aren't you........I rest my case. T First off, Bruce, I don't consider you a \"crackpot\". I may (and often do) disagree with you on purely political matters, but I am willing to \"tolerate\" your views. But that's the point here, I believe. When is tolerance acceptable? When is intolerance acceptable? If it is acceptable to be intolerant of another's views on same sex civil unions (based on your personal religious beliefs), is it also acceptable for a Roman Catholic to be intolerant of a Protestant (based on the Catholic's religious beliefs, articulated by the present Pope's pronouncement that only Roman Catholics are true Christians and all other Christian denominations are flawed) and is it acceptable for the Roman Catholic to write laws to make it a criminal offense to attend an Protestant religious service? I don't smoke tobacco - but I tolerate those who do and question those who feel that smoking tobacco should be criminalized in order to protect smokers from themselves. Does that make me a \"bad\" person because I am not intolerant of tobacco smokers? I am very much a libertarian on social issues - live and let live as long as your actions don't harm others and if you did something wrong in this life, God will judge you and deal with you accordingly. I guess in the eyes of the American Family Association that means I am an agent of Satan, doing my best to destroy the United States.",
