When the US announced plans on deploying ABM systems in Eastern Europe, Russia did not only oppose these plans but also made its own propositions on creating a common counter missile defence for all Europe with Russia actively participating in it. On June 7, 2007, at the G8 summit in Germany, during the direct talks between the two then presidents, George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president made a proposal to the US to use Russian radars for controlling missile launches from Asia (i.e. Iran) thus making the deployment of American ABM systems in Eastern Europe unnecessary. This proposition was not welcomed by the US which had already made preliminary agreements with Poland and Czech Republic on deployment of anti-missile systems on their territory. (....) The Gabala radar is located 200 kilometers from Baku, in the immediate proximity to the Iranian border.

The radar ensures Russia's nuclear missile safety. Radar returns can be used in the interest of defense, science and economy. Gabala military radar facility has a 6,000 km operating range and can track ballistic or cruise missile launches in the southern hemisphere.

The Gabala radar tracks up to 10,000 objects in the outer space above Asia on a daily basis.
