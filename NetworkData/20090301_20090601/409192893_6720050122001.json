Obama needs to do something with the socialists Schumer, Kerry, Kennedy, Reid & Pelosi,and clan - then maybe - maybe he could see through the bs... We have not begun to even feel the consequences of the first wave of layoffs while Obama was coming into office. He was raising taxes to unprecedented levels BEFORE he and congress went on their early Christmas shopping spree... He just spent 4-5-TIMES MORE than Bush did and has actually spent more money than every President combined previous to him - technically speaking... The debt he just created and apparently NOT finished is SO FREAKING HIGH - it will CONSUME over 50% of the ENTIRE Federal Budget in only 5 years. If he is wrong, and he is, we need to start working on that appology letter to China now... because they will not be too happy when we cannot even PAY THE INTEREST PAYMENT on the debt Obama as ALREADY CREATED! That means PRINT more money - the dollar becomes valueless - Peso-Dollars...",
