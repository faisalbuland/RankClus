        "content": "We, my wife and I, could not believe it this morning!!! She brought out her paycheck for me to put in the bank and we saw that she has had an eight dollar and seven cent increase in her federal taxes. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS!!!! I immediately parked my car and got out and began washing her bosses car. When I finished that I began to wash the windows of her salon. when I finished that I went inside and began to wash the floors and then the windows.....Nancy, my wife's boss, asked what the hell was I doing??!!?? I fell to my knees and began kissing her hands and profusely thanking her. My wife started screaming at me \"Stop it you're embarrasing me what are you DOING!!!!\" I stood and told her, \"don't you realise what this means??!!??\" She stood silently and then answered, \"No, I don't, what does it mean?\" It means, that Nancy is giving you a raise of $229,848.00 !! That's two hundred twenty nine thousand eight hundred and forty eight dollars this year for your salary!!! Nancy picked up the phone, dialed and began whispering quietly into the receiver as I stood and realised neither of them had a clue!! So, I once again explained why I was so excited!! LOOK!! Obama promised NOBODY with a family of four who made less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year would get an increase in their taxes!! DON\"T YOU SEE!!?? Nancy has given you a raise. Maybe not as much as I said we're only three in our little family, but it's still got to be more of a raise than you've ever gotten in your whole life!!! AIN'T IT GRAND!!! Nancy hangs up the phone......Uhhh, I meant to tell you, there has been an increase in the federal tax rates, so Laura instead of having a check for $248.61 this week has a check for $240.12 The raise in the rate was a little more than eight dollars a week......... I sat down hard on the floor......(thump)!! DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THEY LIED!!???? YOU CAN\"T MEAN THAT!!???? OBAMA LIED!!??? NO I refuse to believe that!! Every body that voted for him, says he cares more about us than our own fathers do!! They can't be wrong, not THAT wrong anyway.........could they?? You mean to tell me we got a four hundred and sixteen dollar a year increase on an income of less than 21,000 dollars for three people??? That's just not possible, nobody could lie like that, could they?? I mean MILLIONS have been MISLED if you're right!! MILLIONS of trusting people who believe so firmly that government would ALWAYS put their interests first have been misled.....I REFUSE TO BELIEVE that ANY politician could be so perfidious as to do such a thing here in the United States of America, the land of Truth, Justice, and the American way!!! I stormed out refusing to believe my wife and her boss, they have to be LYING!!! I went home and called the local I.R.S. Office in Hyannis, it took twenty minutes, but finally a man came on the phone and told me after I asked my question....yes it's true...what's your problem?? He lied?? WHO lied?? President Obama...he lied!!?? He lied about WHAT??? The increase in taxes....you know the promises and all.... Are you ****ng serious!!?? Yes!! Of course I'm serious!! That's why I called, I couldn't believe it!! O.K. turkey!! One more time for the record, there has been an increase in the tax rate, this is what you see reflected on your wife's check this week, are we CLEAR!!! Yes sir, I guess so, thank you sir.......... GOD!!! And I was starting to believe in the man................. This message has been edited. Last edited by: tawodi, Thu 09 April 2009 01:55 PM",
