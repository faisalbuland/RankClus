The animals are more intelligent than we give them credit.Perhaps a gift of clothing to the Taliban with a certain scent? Perhaps a gift of their favorite meal containing a scent that would isolate them from the general population that would leak through the pores of their skin? They are loyal,hard working and can carry their own when it comes down to it,as well as their listening ability. I realize it would take some work in order to train to the level the Military would require,but just a thought and technique that is basic-like the enemy.",

This is a bit off topic and I apologize in advance but I would like to point out that the \"Taliban\" is a political entity. They are not banned or hunted down. Now the extremists within their \"political party\" are a different story. Think of most of the Taliban as conservatives (Republicans) and the religious extremists as neo-cons. Question; What happens if Afghanistan votes the Taliban back into power in an election? (Highly unlikely during the next election, but in the future.....) Do we pack up and say, \"well, we tried\" or do we take them out of power against the people's wishes? Would that truly be democracy or hypocrisy?",
