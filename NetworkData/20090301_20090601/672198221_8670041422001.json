Operating under the authority of a warrant issued by the Central Investigation Court, the ICTF arrested the suspected leader of a cell responsible for recruiting and preparing females for attacks as suicide bombers. During the early-morning mission, according to military reports, the suspect was apprehended by a security element of the ICTF as she attempted to flee from a building. As a result of tactical questioning, the suspect confirmed her identity and was taken into custody. \u201cThe arrest of [the suspect] strikes a crippling blow to the female suicide bomber network in Baghdad,\u201d said Maj. Seth Krummrich, the Special Operations Task Force - Central Operations Officer. \u201cThe success of this Iraqi-led operation could definitely provide insight and lead to future arrests of senior terrorist leadership.\u201d \u201cThis is a great representation of what a unified and well synchronized ISOF intelligence and operational organization can accomplish,\u201d Krummrich said.",
