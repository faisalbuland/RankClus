I wonder why he (Fitzpatrick) isn't sitting in a military jail or a federal prison right now instead of giving radio interviews and gathering additional military plaintiffs? What about all the other active duty members that are part of Dr. Taitz's Petition for the Extraordinary Writ of Mandamus to SCOTUS? \"http://www.orlytaitzesq.com/blog1/?p=332\" Why aren't they being court martialed for 'questioning' the (alleged) CIC orders or authority? Could it possibly be because they (Barry's gov't) don't want to charge him (or the others) with something and have him go through a trial (i.e. and have a discovery phase)? Perhaps they figure all they can do is try to ignore it and hope the sheeple go back to watching American Idol?", 
        "reply": " Maybe because as a retired military officer his right to be an azz is just as good as yours to be an azz? Meanwhile, back in Birther Land, Orly Taitz is being sued for slander by Philip Berg. Seems there are BIG disputes about all the money they are raising, and there's a big falling out over the loot.
