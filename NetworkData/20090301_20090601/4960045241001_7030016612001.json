Question: Who was really in charge of those aircraft? Supplementary: How do we know? The 9/11 story will have longer legs than Lincoln, JFK and Pearl Harbor put together. None of those events will have caused as much trouble on earth.",

He was the French-connection which provided information about other suspects involved and may have given pertinent info reference 9-11 plans. Oddly there was a pair of French reporters doing a 6-month long study of the fire dept where the WTC is. On the morning of 9-11 they along with the FD were sent to a streetcorner to detect a possible gasleak by an anonymous caller. No gasleak was found but they happened to be on hand to film the first plane crashing into the WTC. Funny how the only country in the world to have a foreign legion did not participate in OIF. Perhaps they feared their abundant problematic Algerian-refugee population would destroy the Eiffel Tower.",
