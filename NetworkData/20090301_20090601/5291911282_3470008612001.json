However, since her parents are paying for the gymnastics lesson she is needs to get her fair share of attention during drills. Is there only one adult? Are there perhaps other classes which are smaller? I would do the following (assuming this is a fairly young child under 10): Speak to the instructor and mention that the girl is a bit timid and is getting brushed (or bullied) aside. It may be that the child is not comfortable with her skill level in the routine and could really use some one on one. Mention that you would really appreciate it if the instructor would provide a little more guidance. Find out if there is a smaller class where things may move a bit slower and more interaction is available with the instructor. This would allow the child to become more confident in her abilities. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",

It may take a little longer for her to decide how she is going to do the run/roll/jump, so some of the aggressive, very energetic kids will pass her by.

Are there perhaps other classes which are smaller? I would do the following (assuming this is a fairly young child under 10): Speak to the instructor and mention that the girl is a bit timid and is getting brushed (or bullied) aside. It may be that the child is not comfortable with her skill level in the routine and could really use some one on one. Mention that you would really appreciate it if the instructor would provide a little more guidance. Find out if there is a smaller class where things may move a bit slower and more interaction is available with the instructor. This would allow the child to become more confident in her abilities. \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",
