Not those crappy foam ones they sell at the Walgreens, but a serious one w/ real support. It actually STOPPED the divergent action that had been going on for 5-10 years. 15 yrs later I went to him for the toe fungus. This is SERIOUS stuff -- they make you get bloodwork before and during the taking of the med to insure that you don't get liver damage (a potential side effect). It cleaned them up to a (relatively) pristine condition, and for the last five years I've been using Lotrimin sporadically to keep it in check. I also scrub those dogs vigorously with a serious brush and some hexachloaphine-based soap (Dial, Safeguard , etc). No more fungi, no yellow tonails, NO RELAPSES. Five years later I get laid off and decide to have the bunion surgery while I still had the COBRA mojo working for me. I am now 12 days post op and I have NO PAIN. I'm on crutches and it's going well. Since I can't bear any weight on the foot, having decent uppper body strength is a must. I had heard horror stories about the surgery -- bad pain, improper healing. But I ccouldn't walk long distances and when I'd get caught off-balance, I'd tweek the foot in ways that hurt for days. I wanted to be able to get back in running shape and get my health in order for retirement. I am 55 and in good shape. I think the older and worser in shape you get, the more poorly you'll respond to the surgery. Try a good orthotic (SPENCO) -- see if it helps; maybe you can put off the surgery till later.",

Five years later I get laid off and decide to have the bunion surgery while I still had the COBRA mojo working for me. I am now 12 days post op and I have NO PAIN. I'm on crutches and it's going well. Since I can't bear any weight on the foot, having decent uppper body strength is a must.

I wanted to be able to get back in running shape and get my health in order for retirement. I am 55 and in good shape.

So I started cutting her toenails myself, and believe me, in the beginning, it was a sacrificial act of love. It's like clearing away dead wood from a tree so the live wood can grow. I had the bright idea of painting her toenails, thinking maybe it would smother the fungus. (Guess if a guy wanted to do that, he could use clear nail polish?) Anyway, it made them look better on a temporary basis, and made her feel better about herself. I've also started to really wash her feel well, with a very soapy washcloth. I am seeing a big improvement. She couldn't take the pills the docs gave her.",
