That is why it is better to try keep AIG on an even keel until all this debt is resolved - - All the more reason to have 100% bank reserve, money backed by something and getting rid of the ability to create money out of nothing. Well, the problem with this latest fiasco, and the whole credit thing in general, it that every time someone creates a debt, whether it be a credit card user, a car loan, a home mortgage, a business loan - whatever it may be - that person just printed some money...because no one has to check to see if any money exists anywhere when those debts are made. Well, you can print paper money to cover it all, but that doesn't stop anyone from going right back out and creating a bunch more non-existent money by taking out more debt. You probably never thought of yourself as the National Mint every time you take out a credit card - but you are, because everybody assumes you and the government are good for it. The really idiotic thing about this is that the biggest banks bundled up all this debt and borrowed against it by selling it all to even bigger companies like AIG, creating double the debt and double the \"money\", which then turned around and lent it ALL out as debt!!!! ! Which doubled again the amount of newly created \"money\" out there. Now the obvious thing is that there are not enough real jobs on this whole planet to pay all that debt. So now the Government is borrowing the equivalence of that debt from the next several generations to try to pay all this debt down - printing greenbacks as rapidly as possible to phony up the deal - - The ONLY thing keeping this all afloat is our trust in Uncle Sam or Obama to pull of a miracle - - Who said \"Religion is Dead?\" We're all true believers after all!! \"In God We Trust\" should be changed to read: In Trusts, We Are God!

People would panic and put a run on every bank, potentially causing triple the number to start down. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is running low on reserves now. Where ever you bank would probably evaporate, along with whatever savings you have in there. A gigantic run on banks would essentially bust the whole world system, and the American Dollar would turn into course toilet paper... That is why it is better to try keep AIG on an even keel until all this debt is resolved - - All the more reason to have 100% bank reserve, money backed by something and getting rid of the ability to create money out of nothing.", 
        "reply": " Well, the problem with this latest fiasco, and the whole credit thing in general, it that every time someone creates a debt, whether it be a credit card user, a car loan, a home mortgage, a business loan - whatever it may be - that person just printed some money...because no one has to check to see if any money exists anywhere when those debts are made. Well, you can print paper money to cover it all, but that doesn't stop anyone from going right back out and creating a bunch more non-existent money by taking out more debt. You probably never thought of yourself as the National Mint every time you take out a credit card - but you are, because everybody assumes you and the government are good for it. The really idiotic thing about this is that the biggest banks bundled up all this debt and borrowed against it by selling it all to even bigger companies like AIG, creating double the debt and double the \"money\", which then turned around and lent it ALL out as debt!!!! ! Which doubled again the amount of newly created \"money\" out there. Now the obvious thing is that there are not enough real jobs on this whole planet to pay all that debt. So now the Government is borrowing the equivalence of that debt from the next several generations to try to pay all this debt down - printing greenbacks as rapidly as possible to phony up the deal - - The ONLY thing keeping this all afloat is our trust in Uncle Sam or Obama to pull of a miracle - - Who said \"Religion is Dead?\" We're all true believers after all!! \"In God We Trust\" should be changed to read: In Trusts, We Are God!

I suppose it was an easy way out to lay the 1st tax payer loan at Bush\u2019s feet when in fact Obama encouraged it but the 2nd is all Obama\u2019s. I suppose it was a good day for him to get outta town. (I heard all about it at the corner bar. Not really, just sort of addressing another post on another thread !) Why would bonuses be given to encourage the very people to stay who bankrupted the company to start with ? I don\u2019t think AIG would go bankrupt they\u2019re to big and would find a way to cut back big spending to remain profitable just like any other business who doesn\u2019t receive tax payer bail out money.",

Well, the problem with this latest fiasco, and the whole credit thing in general, it that every time someone creates a debt, whether it be a credit card user, a car loan, a home mortgage, a business loan - whatever it may be - that person just printed some money...because no one has to check to see if any money exists anywhere when those debts are made. Well, you can print paper money to cover it all, but that doesn't stop anyone from going right back out and creating a bunch more non-existent money by taking out more debt. You probably never thought of yourself as the National Mint every time you take out a credit card - but you are, because everybody assumes you and the government are good for it. The really idiotic thing about this is that the biggest banks bundled up all this debt and borrowed against it by selling it all to even bigger companies like AIG, creating double the debt and double the \"money\", which then turned around and lent it ALL out as debt!!!! ! Which doubled again the amount of newly created \"money\" out there. Now the obvious thing is that there are not enough real jobs on this whole planet to pay all that debt. So now the Government is borrowing the equivalence of that debt from the next several generations to try to pay all this debt down - printing greenbacks as rapidly as possible to phony up the deal - - The ONLY thing keeping this all afloat is our trust in Uncle Sam or Obama to pull of a miracle - - Who said \"Religion is Dead?\" We're all true believers after all!! \"In God We Trust\" should be changed to read: In Trusts, We Are God!
