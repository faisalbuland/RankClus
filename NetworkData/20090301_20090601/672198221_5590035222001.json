On several days of visits, a handful of cars sit in the parking lot, and no trucks arrive at the 10 loading bays at the back of the building. Yet last year, Murtech received $4 million in Pentagon work, all of it without competition, for a variety of warehousing and engineering services. With its long corridor of sparsely occupied offices and an unmanned reception area, Murtech's most striking feature is its owner -- Robert C. Murtha Jr., 49. He is the nephew of Rep. John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who has significant sway over the Defense Department's spending as chairman of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee. Robert Murtha said he is not at liberty to discuss in detail what his company does, but for four years it has subsisted on defense contracts, according to records and interviews. He said Murtech's 17 employees \"provide necessary logistical support\" to Pentagon testing programs that focus on detecting chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, \"and that's about as far as I feel comfortable going.\" Giving more details could provide important clues to terrorist plotters, he said. Murtha's power has had beneficial effects within his family. His brother, Robert C. \"Kit\" Murtha, built a longtime lobbying practice around clients seeking defense funds through the Appropriations Committee and became one of the top members of KSA, a lobbying firm whose contractor clients often received multimillion-dollar earmarks directed through the committee chairman.

Those people from the CIA lied about thier experience and were contractors and also committed violations of their contracts. Do we know these people have done the same yet? If they are providing nuclear detection services(!?!?!?), the point of a no-bid contract is to keep the specifics of their contractual obligations secret. I don't have a problem with that when it comes to something like nuclear detection services.", 
        "reply": " So a no name company of 17 employees is randomly selected for NUCLEAR DETECTION? I don't think so. They aren't even that popular nor have they done that much work. There is no way the Pentagon was just sitting around and decided hey, those guys look cool let's select them for a no-bid contract not knowing what kind of skills they had. It just isn't a sound business practice to that. \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
