He had said that upto this point it was jus a matter of paying a ransom, as if it was nothing more then a business expense. How they(the pirates) have been harmless!!! He also went on a bit of rant about how the French had killed the fellow being held hostage along with family & freinds on his yacht. Usually, I can take Ron. I kind of like his show, knowing he is totally wacked out his mind, neo-communist. But this twisting of events was nothing short of amazing. The sad part, he believes what he says.",
