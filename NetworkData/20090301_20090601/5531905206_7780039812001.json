Both are among the top to deploy due to their most recent return dates (07 and 06 respectively). With that being said, wife has since been tasked. However, it is requested that husband be on the team as well. The SF squadron denies the request citing the possibility of the wife having to supervise the husband while deployed. The wife has since contacted the SF squadron superintendent in the AOR and found out they currently have married couples in their squadron and have had them in the past and do not have any problems with stateside bases sending married couples. Also, with the deployed squadron being as big as it is the super went on to say there is plenty of room for the married SF members to work independently of eachother with out any possiblity of the wife having to be in charge of the husband. Do you think this answer from the AOR will help alleviate any concerns the stateside squadron has about the wife possibly having to supervise the husband? And yes, I'm the wife. I am not the team leader and would not be my husbands fire team leader (if that makes any difference) Also, in our two weeks of RTC training, 3 other NCO's from the team would have be become unavailable before I ever have the chance to supervise my husband. I just find it super frustrating. I understand the mission always comes first. With that being said, he and I are very very hot to go. Is is fair practice to send another airman who has returned from the AOR more recently than my husband just to keep him off the team? Furthermore, every time I've deployed, I've always seen married couples there. It seems to be a home base by home base decision. Case in point, on my last deployment, a certain base sent an E5 wife on the same team with her E3 husband. And as I've already been told, this base I'm deploying to already has married couples there... Can you imagine how ****ty its gonna be for me when this request is completely denied and I have to go over there and see all the happy people who werent denied? What is the standard anyway? It should be all or none. That would be fair. It would also take away from leadership making decisions based on their own personal bias's. I mean, if the AF were run by all our own persaonal bias's... OMG can you only imagine? Also, there have been no unprofessional history between my husand and I to base any speculations on...
