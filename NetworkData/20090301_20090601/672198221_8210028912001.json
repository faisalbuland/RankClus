Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to recognise same-sex marriage, becoming the fifth country in Europe to do so. Sweden was one of the first countries to give gay couples legal \"partnership\" rights, in the mid-1990s, and allowed them to adopt children from 2002. The new law lets homosexuals wed in either a civil or religious ceremony, though individual churches can opt out.

The Iowa Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a lower-court ruling that rejected a state law restricting marriage to a union between a man and woman. Now gays and lesbians may exchange vows as soon as April 24 following the landmark decision. The county attorney who defended the law said he would not seek a rehearing.

(AP) \u2014 The Vermont House has given final approval to a bill that would legalize gay marriage in the state. But the 94-52 vote for final passage on Friday falls short of the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a veto promised by Gov. Jim Douglas. The state Senate is expected to concur with the House action on Monday. The governor's office says he will then veto the bill quickly. Legislative leaders say they could bring the bill up for veto-override votes in the House and Senate as early as Tuesday. \"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hZmLBrL36NObNyMR0ghXN7vB5hYwD97B7E9O0\" Get off the tracks, the train is coming (marriage train...HA, get it?)",
