Vermont was one of ten states that didn't adopt Jessica's Law, so they're not the only one. The problem is more about the judges that refused to apply heavy sentences. The most notorious example is Judge Edward Cashman, who only sentenced an admitted repeat child rapist to 60 days in jail. Cashman is a life-long conservative Republican and church-goer, who argued that \"punishment just does not work\" in regards to child molesters. Naturally, other judges have imposed much heavier sentences on other offenders, because ultimately, it is up to the judge to apply up to, and including, the maximum allowable sentence for these crimes. Other judges in other states have let child rapists off with far too little punishment. So, there's the answer to your question. Your question had nothing to do with the topic at hand. Other than that, Vermont is a fine state with good people, small New England towns, and until just this past decade, they had more cows than people.

Clergy Members Support Marriage Equality One hundred eighty-two clergy members representing nine religious denominations have signed a declaration in support of same-sex marriage in Vermont. An excerpt of the declaration reads, \u201cAs religious people, clergy, and leaders, we commit ourselves to public action, visibility, and education to support the right and freedom of same-gender couples to participate in civil marriage. We oppose the application of sacred texts and religious traditions for the purpose of denying legal and social equity to same-gender couples.\u201d >http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid75063.asp",

I believe that when we stand before God and are judged, what religion we were part of on Earth will not matter. The only thing that will matter is, here is what I said, here is what you did. All things being judged uniquely according to ones own heart. Will people that misinterpreted his words and did something else be guiltless? You think that the Phelps cult misinterprets the Bible to act the way that they do. I do too and feel the same way that you do and shudder when I see them doing things like trying to get a hate statue put up \"in honor\" of Matthew Sheppard after he was killed. How will they be judged? Then there are these people that, in my opinion, have tried to dig deep into the Bible and original translations in order to show that we have been wrong this whole time about what God thinks about homosexuality in order to justify what they want to be true. Controversy amongst the Church goes even further when you look at the Church of Christ who believes that people who use musical instruments in a church service are not acting according to God. Who can really know though until we are faced with the one who said it? It is none of my business how you translate the Bible or choose to follow or not follow after God. We can discuss it in love and if you ask me my opinion I will tell you, but yours is yours and not mine, and you are responsible for yours as I am mine. In some ways many Christians are minor versions of the Phelps group, but then again so are many homosexuals.",

We're not arguing anything about \"church and state.\" I'm making the argument that the Religious Right Reich likes to claim that religion is anti-gay-marriage. This shows otherwise. That's the primary point I'm making. The secondary point is that if, as the Religious Reich claims, marriage is a religious institution, then this proves that quite a few religions would allow gay couples to marry. So why should those religions be subject to the restrictions of other religions that do not allow gays to marry? I'm happy to \"pick a side.\" My side is that each individual religion can do whatever it wants in regards to its religious ceremonies, which people it wants to marry (or not), and how their run their churches and dogma. However, I feel that the law, separate from the church, must apply equally to all couples. What is so hard to understand about that?",
