I am reminded of a horse with their fat lips sticking out grabbing hay. I believe that there is some movie star (Jolie?) that had her lips expanded with botox or something to make them larger, so did that woman that had fourteen babies. Looks like someone hit them in the mouth and fattened their lips. To each their own I suppose. If your born with large lips then that is natural but to have them artificially enlarged doen't seem right to me.",
