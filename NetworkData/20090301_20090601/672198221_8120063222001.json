Silverton Marks Georgia's Biggest Bank Failure to Date posted: 1 DAY 1 HOUR AGOfiled under: Financial CrisisPrintShareText SizeAAANEW YORK (May 1) -- Three more banks shut their doors Friday, according to the federal government, bringing the total number of failures up to 32 in 2009. Recent Bank Failureswww.silvertonbank.com52 photos On May 1, Silverton Bank of Atlanta became Georgia's biggest bank to fail to date. Silverton was known as a correspondent bank and provided services to around 1,400 client banks. Click through the gallery for more news on failed financial institutions.(Note: Please disable your pop-up blocker) DailyFinance: FDIC Explains How Banks Are Seized The first failure was a wholesale banking operator that served 1,400 other lenders across the country and was the fifth biggest bank failure during the current recession in terms of assets. Georgia bank: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a statement that it created a bridge bank to take over the operations of Silverton Bank, National Bank, headquartered in Atlanta. Unlike the other 30 banks that have failed so far in 2009, Silverton Bank did not take deposits directly from the general public or make loans to consumers. Instead, it offered a wide variety of services, such as foreign wire transfers, as well as clearing and cash management, to other banks. Silverton was cooperatively owned by community banks throughout the Southeast and was heavily invested in loans to real estate developments in Florida, Georgia, and other parts of the Southeast, according to Christopher Marinac, managing principal of financial firm FIG Partners LLC based out of Atlanta, Ga. When real estate values sank in the current downturn, the assets backing those properties also lost their value. The Southeast has seen numerous regional banks topple as the housing bubble burst. At the time of its closing, Silverton Bank had approximately $4.1 billion in assets and $3.3 billion in deposits, all of which are expected to be within the FDIC's insurance limits. The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be $1.3 billion, making it the fourth costliest bank failure since the start of the recession. \"It is a bigger hit to the insurance fund than they have seen in the last couple weeks,\" Marinac said. \"This is a bigger issue than we have seen in awhile.",

The Layton, Utah-based bank had total assets of approximately $299.4 million and total deposits of $284.1 million as of Dec. 31. Cache Valley Bank, based in Logan, Utah, is assuming all deposits, paying discounted price of $352,000. It also agreed to buy nearly $11 million worth of America West's assets and took a 30-day option to purchase loans at book value. The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be $119.4 million. America West's three branches will reopen Monday as Cache Valley Bank outposts. Checking accounts, debit cards still work: Through the weekend, depositors of both Citizens Community Bank and America West Bank can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards. Checks drawn on either of the failed banks will continue to be processed, and the FDIC said loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual. This is the first I have heard of this, but that is in Northern Utah, and I live in Central Utah. Most of the time, these things are done pretty quietly on a weekend to avoid any panic - - There has been a lot of over-inflation of size and price of homes in Utah, along with a lot of shady lending practices, greed, ponzi schemes...you name it...in Utah. Wouldn't surprise me if this is just the tip of the ice berg, and the whole state goes bust!! You'd think, in a State as Religious as this, that the Church would be sending up all kinds of red flags about all these shady housing loans and the terrible inflation it is causing, but there is probably and obvious reason for the silence: Many of the highest church officials are bankers and realitors. They are also high-up officials in the government - state and local. All of these entities FEED HEAVILY on the inflation causes by soaring property values! Tithes, Interest, and Taxes all swell right along with the inflation rate, filling all the coffers of the Church/Bank/Government, while bleeding everyone else dry - - As terrible as it may sound - this whole system of vast wealth wrung from those at the bottom via inflated Tithes/Interests/Taxes going to those at the top needs to crash down - - Wandering and Wondering",

The FDIC is an independant government owned Corporation. The Board members are indeed appointed by the President, and then ratified by Congress, but they are NOT POLITICIANS. The government has no say so in running the FDIC. They cannot veto any act of the FDIC. In other words, neither Mr. Bush, or Mr. Obama can tell them a damned thing. All the current Board members are Bush appointee's, but I don't say that to tar them as being wingnuts.
