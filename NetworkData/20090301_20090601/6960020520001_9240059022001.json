You might want to sit in on a mission briefing before making that statement. I understand your short-sightedness, after all, you were a Marine...",

First, \"grunts\" are not cheap. The life cycle cost of soldier/sailor/marine, etc., from recruitment to retirement, including the training s/he receives while active, the retirement pay he receives after, etc., are HUGELY expensive. The budgets of our armed forces are driven by the number of their personnel more than anything else. And in a spiritual sense in a military which believes in \"no body left on the battlefield,\" grunts are priceless, although I know that Mr. Kinney does not suggest nor believe otherwise. Second, it is only Air Force pilots who get a beer after they land. Naval Aviators flying from aircraft carriers do not. The Navy is still dry, except for two beers per man after 45+ consecutive days at sea without a port call. (Note that achieving 45 continuous days at sea is not easy. For example, in 2003 it took USS Kearsarge until day 138 of her deployment to get a Beer Day: she had been underway for 42 days and 36 days straight before she finally hit the magic 45.) Finally, Tomahawks are no longer fired from battleships. That was 1991. Now they are fired from cruisers, destroyers, and submarines as there are no more battleships except as museums. Otherwise the article was perfect. Thanks, Dave",

Yes, the Air Force may not have provided close air support in Iraq for several months, but how about resupply, intel gathering, and aeromedical evac? I know the the ground warriors appreciate and are thankful for these aspects of airpower, and, are also thankful the close air support is only a radio call away if needed.",
