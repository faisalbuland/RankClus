        "content": "March 3, 2009 Here's a summary of an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll just conducted by Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart and Republican pollster Bill McInturff: In the survey, 68% have a favorable opinion of the President, including 47% whose opinion is \"very positive\" - both all-time highs for Obama in the poll. Moreover, 67% say they feel more hopeful about his leadershipp and 60% approve of his job in the Whitehouse. The percentage who are confidant Obama has the right goals and policies for the country - 54% - is slightly smaller, suggesting that the President is more popular than his policies are. Example: 57% support the stimulus, while 34% oppose it. By comparison, the GOP finds its favorability at an all-time low. It also receives most of the blame for the current partisanship in Washington and trails the Democrats by nearly 30 percentage points on the question of which party could best lead the nation out of recession. In their previous poll in January, 26% said the country was on the right track; now 41% think that. This comes at a time when Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy. Only 7% say they're satisfied with the state of the economy, which is an all-time low in the poll. What's more , a whopping 76% believe the economy still has a ways to go before it bottoms out. Eighty-four percent say this is an economy Obama inherited, and two-thirds of those people think he has at least a year before he's responsible for it. \"That's a long leash,\" McInturff says. \"It normally doesn't last that long. But believe me, that's a good place to start.\" A tough six weeks for the GOP Just 26% view the Republican Party positively, which is an all-time low for the party. Thata's compared to 49% who have a favorable view of the Democratic Party. In addition, a combined 56% say the previous Bush administration deserved \"almost all\" of the blame or a \"major part\" of the blame for the partisanship in Washington, and a combined 41% say the same of congressional Republicans. By contrast, only 24% say that of congressional Democrats and just 11% say that of the Obama administration. The public overwhelmingly believes the GOP's opposition to Obama's policies and programs is based on politics: 56% say they're trying to gain political advantage, versus 30% who say they're standing up for their principles. By a 48-20 percent margin, they think the Democratic Party would do a better job os getting the country out of the recession. Republicans, Hart argues, \"have been tone deaf to the results of the 2008 election...They never heard the message. They continue to preach the old-time religion.\" McInturff, the GOP pollster, agrees. \"These are difficult and problematic numbers.\" The poll was conducted of 1,007 adults from Feb. 26 to March 1, and has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. \"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29493021\"",
