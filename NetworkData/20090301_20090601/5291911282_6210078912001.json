More often than not I and my buddies slipped under the fence and saved our money for Soda Pop and Hot dogs. We all shared and some were real good at begging for pit passes. Kenny was a short kid with a baby face who could go from 14 to 10 real quick and get some real nice stuff from sympathetic ladies. After the last race, we tore up the starting line and everyone of us carried a chunk of the track home that night. I started spending more time in Idaho and then went in the military. I used to drive by the entrance on my way to visit my Grandmother in Carson and saw what was beginning to look like a storage lot for construction materials. I think Lions has the distinction of being one of the first \"official\" drag strips for that area and in the country. The big funny cars are what killed it for the locals though. Navy housing not far off and the official complaints from some higher ups as well. Nothing last forever man. Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",

I lived about two miles from LIONS in \"Northtown\" North Long Beach. I could walk down to the railroad tracks that ran between Long Beach and \"North\", follow the tracks for a mile and a half turn left and be at the drag strip. More often than not I and my buddies slipped under the fence and saved our money for Soda Pop and Hot dogs. We all shared and some were real good at begging for pit passes. Kenny was a short kid with a baby face who could go from 14 to 10 real quick and get some real nice stuff from sympathetic ladies. After the last race, we tore up the starting line and everyone of us carried a chunk of the track home that night. I started spending more time in Idaho and then went in the military. I used to drive by the entrance on my way to visit my Grandmother in Carson and saw what was beginning to look like a storage lot for construction materials. I think Lions has the distinction of being one of the first \"official\" drag strips for that area and in the country. The big funny cars are what killed it for the locals though. Navy housing not far off and the official complaints from some higher ups as well. Nothing last forever man. Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",
