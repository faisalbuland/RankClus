        "content": "Here is an article from Global Research that is quite interesting. I do not agree with all points, but I do agree with about 95% of what is contained herein. The rise in the equities market is indeed a stock market bubble induced by the Federal Reserve. This is easily seen when comparing the values of stocks over the past rally to the conditions of the economy. Also, the market is not the root of the problem, so it doesn't even reflect the economy as a whole. The root of the problem was that the Federal Reserve lowered the discount window to 1% six years ago, which allowed the banks to borrow the almost free money and lend it to whoever the hell they wanted to. Thus creating the housing bubble. When that burst, it created a downward spiral that caused a crash in housing, a failed banking system, failing industries and skyrocketing unemployment. Notice, the equities market itself has nothing to do with any of this. Today, the rise in the market is the result of speculators taking advantage of the Fed's capital injections before those capital injections fail. In other words, the money hungries are making their money while they can. Wells Fargo was a story of optimism over the past few weeks. But, what is really going on here. As many of you know, I was quick to show the problems associated with the FASB easing mark-to-market rules. Because, Wells Fargos profits are nothing more than their overvaluing of their worthless mortgage-backed assets, merger accounting and mortgage default moratoriums. Their profits are not a reflection of trends in the economy. A good indicator of this is the fact that their stock has been downgraded to \"underperform\". Deflation is still strong as ever. Fuel, food wholesale and housing prices are still falling. Unemployment is still seeing record lows as we lose 650,000 jobs a month. Both the manufacturing and Industrial sectors are at record lows. These are the true indicators of the state of the economy, not the stock market. This is a point that I have some reservations about, but that is only because I opposed the stimulus in the first place. But, it is quite interesting. Our size of our economy is about $14 trillion. The stimulus was only $787 billion. With unemployment continuing to rise, the manufacturing and industrial sectors continuing to fall, how can we expect the stimulus to have any effect on an economy where consumer spending accounts for 72% of total GDP? We can't. The only indicator of any optimism in our economy coming back is that the stock market has been rallying. And, as can be easily seen, that is not a real indicator at all. Plus, it is even scarier when you find out that the Federal Reserve is using cheap money to boost the equities market and to induce borrowing when that is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.

        "content": "Here is an article from Global Research that is quite interesting. I do not agree with all points, but I do agree with about 95% of what is contained herein. The rise in the equities market is indeed a stock market bubble induced by the Federal Reserve. This is easily seen when comparing the values of stocks over the past rally to the conditions of the economy. Also, the market is not the root of the problem, so it doesn't even reflect the economy as a whole. The root of the problem was that the Federal Reserve lowered the discount window to 1% six years ago, which allowed the banks to borrow the almost free money and lend it to whoever the hell they wanted to. Thus creating the housing bubble. When that burst, it created a downward spiral that caused a crash in housing, a failed banking system, failing industries and skyrocketing unemployment. Notice, the equities market itself has nothing to do with any of this. Today, the rise in the market is the result of speculators taking advantage of the Fed's capital injections before those capital injections fail. In other words, the money hungries are making their money while they can. Wells Fargo was a story of optimism over the past few weeks. But, what is really going on here. As many of you know, I was quick to show the problems associated with the FASB easing mark-to-market rules. Because, Wells Fargos profits are nothing more than their overvaluing of their worthless mortgage-backed assets, merger accounting and mortgage default moratoriums. Their profits are not a reflection of trends in the economy. A good indicator of this is the fact that their stock has been downgraded to \"underperform\". Deflation is still strong as ever. Fuel, food wholesale and housing prices are still falling. Unemployment is still seeing record lows as we lose 650,000 jobs a month. Both the manufacturing and Industrial sectors are at record lows. These are the true indicators of the state of the economy, not the stock market. This is a point that I have some reservations about, but that is only because I opposed the stimulus in the first place. But, it is quite interesting. Our size of our economy is about $14 trillion. The stimulus was only $787 billion. With unemployment continuing to rise, the manufacturing and industrial sectors continuing to fall, how can we expect the stimulus to have any effect on an economy where consumer spending accounts for 72% of total GDP? We can't. The only indicator of any optimism in our economy coming back is that the stock market has been rallying. And, as can be easily seen, that is not a real indicator at all. Plus, it is even scarier when you find out that the Federal Reserve is using cheap money to boost the equities market and to induce borrowing when that is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.

I never worry about tax breaks because I never pay what the marginal rates say I should. I always pay somewhere around 5% when it comes to income taxes. As for goods, I get almost everything from the internet. I have a company car and gas card, so I don't worry about that. And, food isn't taxed in Ohio. So, the main thing that I look at with taxes is new taxes. Taxes that didn't exist before.",

If we were to ignore international treaties we could have sprayed ricin in those Tora Bora caves and removed all ROE then called it a day.[/COLOR [COLOR:RED]As far as the Geneva convention agreement a Geneva convention card was issued to me in boot camp along with my ID card which I carried with me at all times and still have so theres no question that we are participants and signators. Its not that they allow torture of any kind, its that there are methods of interrogation they dont classify as being torture. That normally includes physcological methods which are not considered physical abuse.",

The rise in the equities market is indeed a stock market bubble induced by the Federal Reserve.

Also, the market is not the root of the problem, so it doesn't even reflect the economy as a whole. The root of the problem was that the Federal Reserve lowered the discount window to 1% six years ago, which allowed the banks to borrow the almost free money and lend it to whoever the hell they wanted to. Thus creating the housing bubble. When that burst, it created a downward spiral that caused a crash in housing, a failed banking system, failing industries and skyrocketing unemployment. Notice, the equities market itself has nothing to do with any of this. Today, the rise in the market is the result of speculators taking advantage of the Fed's capital injections before those capital injections fail. In other words, the money hungries are making their money while they can. Wells Fargo was a story of optimism over the past few weeks. But, what is really going on here. As many of you know, I was quick to show the problems associated with the FASB easing mark-to-market rules. Because, Wells Fargos profits are nothing more than their overvaluing of their worthless mortgage-backed assets, merger accounting and mortgage default moratoriums. Their profits are not a reflection of trends in the economy. A good indicator of this is the fact that their stock has been downgraded to \"underperform\". Deflation is still strong as ever. Fuel, food wholesale and housing prices are still falling. Unemployment is still seeing record lows as we lose 650,000 jobs a month. Both the manufacturing and Industrial sectors are at record lows. These are the true indicators of the state of the economy, not the stock market. This is a point that I have some reservations about, but that is only because I opposed the stimulus in the first place. But, it is quite interesting. Our size of our economy is about $14 trillion. The stimulus was only $787 billion. With unemployment continuing to rise, the manufacturing and industrial sectors continuing to fall, how can we expect the stimulus to have any effect on an economy where consumer spending accounts for 72% of total GDP? We can't. The only indicator of any optimism in our economy coming back is that the stock market has been rallying. And, as can be easily seen, that is not a real indicator at all. Plus, it is even scarier when you find out that the Federal Reserve is using cheap money to boost the equities market and to induce borrowing when that is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.

        "content": "Here is an article from Global Research that is quite interesting. I do not agree with all points, but I do agree with about 95% of what is contained herein. The rise in the equities market is indeed a stock market bubble induced by the Federal Reserve. This is easily seen when comparing the values of stocks over the past rally to the conditions of the economy. Also, the market is not the root of the problem, so it doesn't even reflect the economy as a whole. The root of the problem was that the Federal Reserve lowered the discount window to 1% six years ago, which allowed the banks to borrow the almost free money and lend it to whoever the hell they wanted to. Thus creating the housing bubble. When that burst, it created a downward spiral that caused a crash in housing, a failed banking system, failing industries and skyrocketing unemployment. Notice, the equities market itself has nothing to do with any of this. Today, the rise in the market is the result of speculators taking advantage of the Fed's capital injections before those capital injections fail. In other words, the money hungries are making their money while they can. Wells Fargo was a story of optimism over the past few weeks. But, what is really going on here. As many of you know, I was quick to show the problems associated with the FASB easing mark-to-market rules. Because, Wells Fargos profits are nothing more than their overvaluing of their worthless mortgage-backed assets, merger accounting and mortgage default moratoriums. Their profits are not a reflection of trends in the economy. A good indicator of this is the fact that their stock has been downgraded to \"underperform\". Deflation is still strong as ever. Fuel, food wholesale and housing prices are still falling. Unemployment is still seeing record lows as we lose 650,000 jobs a month. Both the manufacturing and Industrial sectors are at record lows. These are the true indicators of the state of the economy, not the stock market. This is a point that I have some reservations about, but that is only because I opposed the stimulus in the first place. But, it is quite interesting. Our size of our economy is about $14 trillion. The stimulus was only $787 billion. With unemployment continuing to rise, the manufacturing and industrial sectors continuing to fall, how can we expect the stimulus to have any effect on an economy where consumer spending accounts for 72% of total GDP? We can't. The only indicator of any optimism in our economy coming back is that the stock market has been rallying. And, as can be easily seen, that is not a real indicator at all. Plus, it is even scarier when you find out that the Federal Reserve is using cheap money to boost the equities market and to induce borrowing when that is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.

As for goods, I get almost everything from the internet. I have a company car and gas card, so I don't worry about that. And, food isn't taxed in Ohio. So, the main thing that I look at with taxes is new taxes. Taxes that didn't exist before.",

If we were to ignore international treaties we could have sprayed ricin in those Tora Bora caves and removed all ROE then called it a day.[/COLOR [COLOR:RED]As far as the Geneva convention agreement a Geneva convention card was issued to me in boot camp along with my ID card which I carried with me at all times and still have so theres no question that we are participants and signators. Its not that they allow torture of any kind, its that there are methods of interrogation they dont classify as being torture. That normally includes physcological methods which are not considered physical abuse.",

Also, the market is not the root of the problem, so it doesn't even reflect the economy as a whole. The root of the problem was that the Federal Reserve lowered the discount window to 1% six years ago, which allowed the banks to borrow the almost free money and lend it to whoever the hell they wanted to. Thus creating the housing bubble. When that burst, it created a downward spiral that caused a crash in housing, a failed banking system, failing industries and skyrocketing unemployment. Notice, the equities market itself has nothing to do with any of this. Today, the rise in the market is the result of speculators taking advantage of the Fed's capital injections before those capital injections fail. In other words, the money hungries are making their money while they can. Wells Fargo was a story of optimism over the past few weeks. But, what is really going on here. As many of you know, I was quick to show the problems associated with the FASB easing mark-to-market rules. Because, Wells Fargos profits are nothing more than their overvaluing of their worthless mortgage-backed assets, merger accounting and mortgage default moratoriums. Their profits are not a reflection of trends in the economy. A good indicator of this is the fact that their stock has been downgraded to \"underperform\". Deflation is still strong as ever. Fuel, food wholesale and housing prices are still falling. Unemployment is still seeing record lows as we lose 650,000 jobs a month. Both the manufacturing and Industrial sectors are at record lows. These are the true indicators of the state of the economy, not the stock market. This is a point that I have some reservations about, but that is only because I opposed the stimulus in the first place. But, it is quite interesting. Our size of our economy is about $14 trillion. The stimulus was only $787 billion. With unemployment continuing to rise, the manufacturing and industrial sectors continuing to fall, how can we expect the stimulus to have any effect on an economy where consumer spending accounts for 72% of total GDP? We can't. The only indicator of any optimism in our economy coming back is that the stock market has been rallying. And, as can be easily seen, that is not a real indicator at all. Plus, it is even scarier when you find out that the Federal Reserve is using cheap money to boost the equities market and to induce borrowing when that is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.

The market may not be an indicator of the health of the economy, but it is a sure sign of confidence and that confidence will lead to healing the economy as the scare tactics diminish and people realize its going to take time, and get on with thier lives.
