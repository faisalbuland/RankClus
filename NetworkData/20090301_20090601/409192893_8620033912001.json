But as Heritage analyst Brian Riedl has pointed out, given that Obama has already helped quadruple the deficit with his stimulus package, pledging to halve it by 2013 is hardly ambitious. The Washington Post has a great graphic which helps put President Obama\u2019s budget deficits in context of President Bush\u2019s. What\u2019s driving Obama\u2019s unprecedented massive deficits? Spending. Riedl details: President Bush expanded the federal budget by a historic $700 billion through 2008. President Obama would add another $1 trillion. President Bush began a string of expensive finan\u00adcial bailouts. President Obama is accelerating that course. President Bush created a Medicare drug entitle\u00adment that will cost an estimated $800 billion in its first decade. President Obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern\u00adment health care fund. President Bush increased federal education spending 58 percent faster than inflation. Presi\u00addent Obama would double it. President Bush became the first President to spend 3 percent of GDP on federal antipoverty programs. President Obama has already in\u00adcreased this spending by 20 percent. President Bush tilted the income tax burden more toward upper-income taxpayers. President Obama would continue that trend. President Bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008. Setting aside 2009 (for which Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for an additional $2.6 trillion in public debt), President Obama\u2019s budget would add $4.9 trillion in public debt from the beginning of 2010 through 2016. UPDATE: Many Obama defenders in the comments are claiming that the numbers above do not include spending on Iraq and Afghanistan during the Bush years. They most certainly do. While Bush did fund the wars through emergency supplementals (not the regular budget process), that spending did not simply vanish. It is included in the numbers above. Also, some Obama defenders are claiming the graphic above represents biased Heritage Foundation numbers. While we stand behind the numbers we put out 100%, the numbers, and the graphic itself, above are from the Washington Post. We originally left out the link to WaPo. It has been now been added. CLARIFICATION: Of course, this Washington Post graphic does not perfectly delineate budget surpluses and deficits by administration. President Bush took office in January 2001, and therefore played a lead role in crafting the FY 2002-2008 budgets. Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for the FY 2009 budget deficit that overlaps their administrations, before President Obama assumes full budgetary responsibility beginning in FY 2010. Overall, President Obama\u2019s budget would add twice as much debt as President Bush over the same number of years.

In effect, increased government spending under these employment conditions would \"crowd out\" private spending. Measured GDP would not be much affected, if at all. To be sure, the efficiency of the economy would rise if too little had previously been invested in this infrastructure, while efficiency would fall if this government spending were more wasteful than the private spending that was crowded out. This analysis is a useful starting point to consider the effects of stimulus packages, such as the one proposed by soon-to-be President Obama. Of course, the present situation is not one of full employment but of underemployment and excess unemployment, and employment is still falling. How does one adjust the full employment analysis in the first paragraph to account for the presence of unemployed labor and capital? One extreme assumes no crowding out of other private spending when governments increase their spending with significant underemployment in the economy. Increased government spending through a stimulus package under these conditions might even have a \"multiplier\" effect that would greatly increase, not crowd out, other private spending. The reason is that the recipients of the government spending in turn would increase their spending, and thereby stimulate other activities. Intermediate assumptions assume partial crowding out of other private activities, so a stimulus package would still increase employment and GDP. However, the value, if any, of the increase would depend on how effectively governments spend the stimulus compared to the private spending that is crowded out. \"http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2009/01/on_the_obama_st.html\" See how quotes work in context?",

But as Heritage analyst Brian Riedl has pointed out, given that Obama has already helped quadruple the deficit with his stimulus package, pledging to halve it by 2013 is hardly ambitious. The Washington Post has a great graphic which helps put President Obama\u2019s budget deficits in context of President Bush\u2019s. What\u2019s driving Obama\u2019s unprecedented massive deficits? Spending. Riedl details: President Bush expanded the federal budget by a historic $700 billion through 2008. President Obama would add another $1 trillion. President Bush began a string of expensive finan\u00adcial bailouts. President Obama is accelerating that course. President Bush created a Medicare drug entitle\u00adment that will cost an estimated $800 billion in its first decade. President Obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern\u00adment health care fund. President Bush increased federal education spending 58 percent faster than inflation. Presi\u00addent Obama would double it. President Bush became the first President to spend 3 percent of GDP on federal antipoverty programs. President Obama has already in\u00adcreased this spending by 20 percent. President Bush tilted the income tax burden more toward upper-income taxpayers. President Obama would continue that trend. President Bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008. Setting aside 2009 (for which Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for an additional $2.6 trillion in public debt), President Obama\u2019s budget would add $4.9 trillion in public debt from the beginning of 2010 through 2016. UPDATE: Many Obama defenders in the comments are claiming that the numbers above do not include spending on Iraq and Afghanistan during the Bush years. They most certainly do. While Bush did fund the wars through emergency supplementals (not the regular budget process), that spending did not simply vanish. It is included in the numbers above. Also, some Obama defenders are claiming the graphic above represents biased Heritage Foundation numbers. While we stand behind the numbers we put out 100%, the numbers, and the graphic itself, above are from the Washington Post. We originally left out the link to WaPo. It has been now been added. CLARIFICATION: Of course, this Washington Post graphic does not perfectly delineate budget surpluses and deficits by administration. President Bush took office in January 2001, and therefore played a lead role in crafting the FY 2002-2008 budgets. Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for the FY 2009 budget deficit that overlaps their administrations, before President Obama assumes full budgetary responsibility beginning in FY 2010. Overall, President Obama\u2019s budget would add twice as much debt as President Bush over the same number of years. Source: \"http://blog.heritage.org/2009/03/24/bush-deficit-vs-obama-deficit-in-pictures/\" a. The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank. You can guess the rest. b. A \"projection\" is just another word for \"guess\". Bush's numbers are real, just as the $1.3 trillion deficit he left behind and all the activities, etc., that continued the US budget on a high burn rate; the numbers for Obama's is someone's speculation, adjusted appropriately to make the desired point.",

Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for the FY 2009 budget deficit that overlaps their administrations, before President Obama assumes full budgetary responsibility beginning in FY 2010. Overall, President Obama\u2019s budget would add twice as much debt as President Bush over the same number of years. Source: \"http://blog.heritage.org/2009/03/24/bush-deficit-vs-obama-deficit-in-pictures/\" a. The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank. You can guess the rest. b. A \"projection\" is just another word for \"guess\". Bush's numbers are real, just as the $1.3 trillion deficit he left behind and all the activities, etc., that continued the US budget on a high burn rate; the numbers for Obama's is someone's speculation, adjusted appropriately to make the desired point.", 
        "reply": " I'm with you right up until you blame Bush for Obama's budget. Have some respect for Obama. HE signed it. You think Obama is so weak and foolish that even after Bush left offfice, Bush could still force Obama to do something beyond his will? Bush left almost nothing that Obama could not have stopped in six months. Anything Obama signed he did so because he agreed with it...sort of like rendition.",

Are you denying that, on 20 January 2009, our known budget deficit was $1.3 trillion dollars? If you don't deny that, how would Obama end such a deficit in six months? Granted, he could stop many of the actions that contributed to that deficit, but what would have been the consequences of doing that? Take, for example, Iraq and Afghanistan. If he declared on the very first day of his Presidency that we were out of both of those places, he would set into motion actions that would cost.

But in response, some economists are speaking out. *Greg Mankiw at Harvard has written about his skepticism regarding a huge stimulus package. *David Backus at New York University has expressed similar concerns (via Professor Mankiw\u2019s blog; Professor Mankiw also shared an e-mail message from a reader purporting to work at the Defense Department who, having witnessed government expansion in the form of the Department of Homeland Security, is suspicious of how quickly and efficiently taxpayer dollars could now be spent in the name of stimulus). *Robert E. Lucas, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, wrote that Fed policy (as opposed to, presumably, fiscal policy) is the best means for digging the country out of recession. *Jonathan Bean at the Independent Institute and David R. Henderson at the Hoover Institution both looked at whether fiscal stimulus actually cured previous economic downturns, and by extension, whether it is likely to have any effect this time. Mr. Bean noted that many economists and historians now believe the New Deal \u2014 which some see as the model for extricating America from the current recession \u2014 actually prolonged the Great Depression. Mr. Henderson looked at studies done by President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s choice to head the Council of Economic Advisers, Christina Romer, that showed that fiscal policy has had little effect in ending previous recessions. *Arnold Kling at EconLog gives several reasons to opt for a small stimulus package rather than a large one. *Tyler Cowen at George Mason University writes that the evidence on whether fiscal policy is effective is \u201cinconclusive.\u201d *Reader Jeremy H. shared this list, put together by the House Republican leadership, of economists who are questioning the wisdom of a big stimulus package. *Kevin Hassett, director of economic-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a Bloomberg News columnist, argues that \u201cThis year may establish a government-spending black hole with gravity strong enough to suck the U.S. economy over the event horizon.\u201d *The Nobel laureate and University of Chicago economics professor Gary Becker worries that increased government spending in the form of a gigantic stimulus package would \u201ccrowd out\u201d private sector spending. He also says he believes that a recent report from Mr. Obama\u2019s transition team economists may \u201coverestimate the effects of this stimulus package on the economy, and that the same techniques would similarly overestimate the employment effects of other types of government spending and tax reduction policies.\u201d Now this is where, if i was you, I would say: okay, I was wrong.",

He's not totally against the stimulus package. Here's his blog excerpt: I would institute an immediate and permanent reduction in the payroll tax, financed by a gradual, permanent, and substantial increase in the gasoline tax. I would make the two tax changes equal in present value, so while the package results in a short-run budget deficit, there is no long-term budget impact. Call it the create-jobs, save-the-environment, reduce-traffic-congestion, budget-neutral tax shift. \"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-preferred-fiscal-stimulus.html\" Interestingly, Mankiw is a proponent of outsourcing, and says it helps the economy. David Backus: Actual quote from the mentioned email: What would I do? I'd prefer to remain in my comfortable office at NYU, but if forced to make a recommendation, I guess I'd say the following: Go ahead, spend a few hundred billion over the next two years; it may help, especially if the economy performs worse than we expect. But spend it on things that have clear social value. At the same time, try to make some progress on the long-term spending issues built into our current retirement and health-care systems. That won't be nearly as popular as spending money now, but it's an opportunity to show some real leadership. And make sure you keep your eyes on the financial system: if the banks don't recover, none of us will. Good luck! \"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/12/backus-on-spending-stimulus.html\" Robert E. Lucas: The quote is taken from a WSJ article written in December addressing the Fed's lowering of interests rates that week. He doesn't mention anything about a stimulus package, or his opinion about one. \"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122999959052129273.html\" Jonathan Bean: Didn't give his opinion one way or the other whether the New Deal worked: If this country is to have a \u201cNew New Deal,\u201d we need a more nuanced understanding of the original New Deal. In arguing for open debate, one might take a page from New Dealer Harry S Truman, who famously stated that \u201cthe only thing new in the world is the history that you don\u2019t know.\u201d \"http://www.independent.org/blog/?p=840\" Arnold Kling: Big or small, he is still advocating a stimulus spending plan. \"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/01/against_the_big.html\" Tyler Cowen: Not totally against a stimulus plan either. Just the specifics of how it's spent. \"http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/01/05/pm_fiscal_stimulus/\" Gary Becker: If the government increased its spending on infrastructure when the economy has full employment, its main impact would likely be to draw labor, capital, and raw materials away from various other activities. In effect, increased government spending under these employment conditions would \"crowd out\" private spending. Measured GDP would not be much affected, if at all. To be sure, the efficiency of the economy would rise if too little had previously been invested in this infrastructure, while efficiency would fall if this government spending were more wasteful than the private spending that was crowded out. This analysis is a useful starting point to consider the effects of stimulus packages, such as the one proposed by soon-to-be President Obama. Of course, the present situation is not one of full employment but of underemployment and excess unemployment, and employment is still falling. How does one adjust the full employment analysis in the first paragraph to account for the presence of unemployed labor and capital? One extreme assumes no crowding out of other private spending when governments increase their spending with significant underemployment in the economy. Increased government spending through a stimulus package under these conditions might even have a \"multiplier\" effect that would greatly increase, not crowd out, other private spending. The reason is that the recipients of the government spending in turn would increase their spending, and thereby stimulate other activities. Intermediate assumptions assume partial crowding out of other private activities, so a stimulus package would still increase employment and GDP. However, the value, if any, of the increase would depend on how effectively governments spend the stimulus compared to the private spending that is crowded out. \"http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2009/01/on_the_obama_st.html\" See how quotes work in context?",

I'd prefer to remain in my comfortable office at NYU, but if forced to make a recommendation, I guess I'd say the following: Go ahead, spend a few hundred billion over the next two years; it may help, especially if the economy performs worse than we expect. But spend it on things that have clear social value. At the same time, try to make some progress on the long-term spending issues built into our current retirement and health-care systems. That won't be nearly as popular as spending money now, but it's an opportunity to show some real leadership. And make sure you keep your eyes on the financial system: if the banks don't recover, none of us will. Good luck! \"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/12/backus-on-spending-stimulus.html\" Robert E. Lucas: The quote is taken from a WSJ article written in December addressing the Fed's lowering of interests rates that week. He doesn't mention anything about a stimulus package, or his opinion about one. \"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122999959052129273.html\" Jonathan Bean: Didn't give his opinion one way or the other whether the New Deal worked: If this country is to have a \u201cNew New Deal,\u201d we need a more nuanced understanding of the original New Deal. In arguing for open debate, one might take a page from New Dealer Harry S Truman, who famously stated that \u201cthe only thing new in the world is the history that you don\u2019t know.\u201d \"http://www.independent.org/blog/?p=840\" Arnold Kling: Big or small, he is still advocating a stimulus spending plan. \"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/01/against_the_big.html\" Tyler Cowen: Not totally against a stimulus plan either. Just the specifics of how it's spent. \"http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/01/05/pm_fiscal_stimulus/\" Gary Becker: If the government increased its spending on infrastructure when the economy has full employment, its main impact would likely be to draw labor, capital, and raw materials away from various other activities. In effect, increased government spending under these employment conditions would \"crowd out\" private spending. Measured GDP would not be much affected, if at all. To be sure, the efficiency of the economy would rise if too little had previously been invested in this infrastructure, while efficiency would fall if this government spending were more wasteful than the private spending that was crowded out. This analysis is a useful starting point to consider the effects of stimulus packages, such as the one proposed by soon-to-be President Obama. Of course, the present situation is not one of full employment but of underemployment and excess unemployment, and employment is still falling. How does one adjust the full employment analysis in the first paragraph to account for the presence of unemployed labor and capital? One extreme assumes no crowding out of other private spending when governments increase their spending with significant underemployment in the economy. Increased government spending through a stimulus package under these conditions might even have a \"multiplier\" effect that would greatly increase, not crowd out, other private spending. The reason is that the recipients of the government spending in turn would increase their spending, and thereby stimulate other activities. Intermediate assumptions assume partial crowding out of other private activities, so a stimulus package would still increase employment and GDP. However, the value, if any, of the increase would depend on how effectively governments spend the stimulus compared to the private spending that is crowded out. \"http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2009/01/on_the_obama_st.html\" See how quotes work in context?",

The Washington Post has a great graphic which helps put President Obama\u2019s budget deficits in context of President Bush\u2019s. What\u2019s driving Obama\u2019s unprecedented massive deficits? Spending. Riedl details: President Bush expanded the federal budget by a historic $700 billion through 2008. President Obama would add another $1 trillion. President Bush began a string of expensive finan\u00adcial bailouts. President Obama is accelerating that course. President Bush created a Medicare drug entitle\u00adment that will cost an estimated $800 billion in its first decade. President Obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern\u00adment health care fund. President Bush increased federal education spending 58 percent faster than inflation. Presi\u00addent Obama would double it. President Bush became the first President to spend 3 percent of GDP on federal antipoverty programs. President Obama has already in\u00adcreased this spending by 20 percent. President Bush tilted the income tax burden more toward upper-income taxpayers. President Obama would continue that trend. President Bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008. Setting aside 2009 (for which Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for an additional $2.6 trillion in public debt), President Obama\u2019s budget would add $4.9 trillion in public debt from the beginning of 2010 through 2016. UPDATE: Many Obama defenders in the comments are claiming that the numbers above do not include spending on Iraq and Afghanistan during the Bush years. They most certainly do.

CLARIFICATION: Of course, this Washington Post graphic does not perfectly delineate budget surpluses and deficits by administration. President Bush took office in January 2001, and therefore played a lead role in crafting the FY 2002-2008 budgets. Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for the FY 2009 budget deficit that overlaps their administrations, before President Obama assumes full budgetary responsibility beginning in FY 2010.
