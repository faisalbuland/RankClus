(the tip off was the guitarists and the drummer were all wearing head phones and the fact that they needed their own 12 sound tracks to everyone else's 3) Symphonic type music often requires the layering of many vocal/instrument tracks, and you just can't get away with one voice and have the same song in live situations. Evanessance, Nightwish, Edenbridge, all do this. Most folks don't realize when they listen to a recording, they're listening to MANY guitars play the song. That was Randy Rhoads' forte. His ability to play the same thing exactly the same way more than once. It allowed him to layer guitar parts ad infinitum. One method used live for guitarists is to play one guitar through many amps, all set slightly differently. It sounds like multiple guitars. (Like one has multiple violins in an orchestra) Ronnie Montrose even went so far as set his guitar up so every string on his guitar had it's own amplifier. It doesn't work for harmony vocal parts. Are you sure Geoff wasn't singing one part in harmony with recordings of himself? That's what I'd suspect. At any rate QR has always rocked. And I have to thank them for giving me my first insight into activist propoganda techniques. I remember as a youngster, listening to the song \"Empire\". During the break Geoff states some stats. \"In fiscal year 1986 to 1987 the federal government spent a total of (blah blah blah) dollars on law enforcement. By way of comparison the federal government spent (so much) on space exploration, and (so many TIMES) more on national defense.\" Studying the Constitution at the time, I realized that it was the Feds JOB to defend the nation and explore space, while law enforcement was largely the burden of states, counties, and local municipalities. THOSE numbers were not included. All was as it should be, and an ommissive statement gave the impression it was not. Very educational. I laud them for this latest work. Awesome.",
