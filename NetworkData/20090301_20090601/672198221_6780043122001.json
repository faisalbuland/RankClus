The exercise focussing on command and staff will involve 1300 virtually-unarmed troops, probably a half-dozen logistics and field kitchen units. Sounds like the makings of a series of damn fine pot luck suppers. Nutella for everybody! The Russ are saying it's a 'prop job' for the beleaguered Sarkaashvili.",
