Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is expected to introduce his version of the legislation later this month, immediately applauded the House passage, \u201cI am extremely pleased that a strong bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives has passed legislation empowering the Food & Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products. FDA regulation of cigarettes \u2013 the most lethal of all consumer products \u2013 is long overdue. I am confident that the Senate will approve it expeditiously, and send it to President Obama for his signature,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement. The Massachusetts Democrat and Representative Henry Waxman of California have pushed the legislation since the US Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that the agency did not have that authority. The vote was 298-112, the Associated Press reports, overcoming years of opposition from tobacco-state lawmakers and other critics. President Obama supports the bill, which Bush administration threatened to veto. All 10 Massachusetts Democrats in the House voted for the bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for full approval by Congress. \"Every day, Americans benefit from the oversight the FDA provides on the foods we eat and the medicines we take. Despite the fact that tobacco is one of the deadliest products in America, the FDA has no authority to regulate it. That is just not right,\" she said in a statement. \"Incredibly, tobacco is exempt from standards that apply to a can of soda or a box of pasta. Tobacco makers are exempt from critical and basic consumer protections, such as ingredient disclosure, product testing, and restrictions on marketing their dangerous and addictive product to children. By granting the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products, we will protect public health, prevent disease, and stop tobacco companies from hooking America's children on their deadly product. This legislation also requires detailed disclosure of tobacco product ingredients, and restricts tobacco marketing and sales to youth, among other things. And this legislation does all of this in a fiscally responsible way -- funding FDA tobacco activity through a user fee on tobacco manufacturers.\" Senator Richard Burr, R-N.C., is expected to lead the opposition, but supporters are confident they can clear the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster. \"This vote brings us closer to putting a deceitful and dangerous industry under the watchful eyes of government regulators,\" American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said in a statement. Opponents from tobacco-growing states such as top-producing North Carolina argued that the FDA had proven through food safety failures that it's not up to the job. They also said that instead of unrealistically trying to get smokers to quit or prevent them from starting, lawmakers should ensure they have other options, like smokeless tobacco. That was the aim of an alternate bill offered by Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., who would leave the FDA out and create a different agency within the Health and Human Services Department. His proposal failed on a 284-142 vote. \"Effectively giving FDA stamp of approval on cigarettes will improperly lead people to believe that these products are safe, and they really aren't,\" Buyer said. \"We want to move people from smoking down the continuum of risk to eventually quitting.\" Major public health groups, including the American Lung Association and the American Medical Association, wrote to lawmakers asking them to oppose Buyer's bill, contending it would leave tobacco companies without meaningful regulation and able to make untested claims about the health effects of their products. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., also was unsuccessful in changing a provision that allows the FDA to tap its general fund for about six months to get the new program started. He argued that money would be diverted from the agency's already overstretched food inspection and disease research budgets. Waxman countered that the user fees from the tobacco industry would pay for the new FDA office and that any money borrowed from the general fund would be paid back without affecting other programs. Buyer pointed out that Waxman's bill is supported by the nation's largest tobacco company, Marlboro maker Philip Morris USA. Officials at rival tobacco companies contend the Waxman bill could lock in Philip Morris' market share. Material from the Associated Press was used in this report.",
