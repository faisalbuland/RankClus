And yet some people will insist we are all there is. one of the pictures showed a Galaxie which was one million light years away. To figure that distance one has to consider an object moving at 186,000 miles per second for one year then multiply that number by one million. Quite a distance mind boggling, and thats only what the Hubble was able to see. Whats beyond that? And all in between Hundreds of trillions of tiny specks, Us being no more than one of those specks. So now with that said how could it even be in the realm of possibility that we alone are the only life form in this incalcuable vastness. And still further what makes it so hard to concieve that we have not been visited? Just the mention of Aliens brings ridicule and discredit. Why? Is humanity that backward or are some that clever with the ability to control the masses. Its humbling to say the least and makes me feel powerless and super insignificant when I give thought to this subject which is limitless. Does Anyone believe we have not been visited? and what do you base your belief on?",
