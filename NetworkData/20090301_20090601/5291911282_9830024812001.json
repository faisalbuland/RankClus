I have been searching and searching online for something about female soldiers cheating during deployment and everything is always about the \"male\" soldier and how he cheated or how his lady cheated. I am currently deployed to Iraq and am the quintessential 'FOBIT.' Without going into too much detail I want to know if there is anyone out there who might be able to relate to what it is like to in a loving supportive relationship back at home, but cheated while deployed because the temptation is relentless. (Especially if you are a very attractive female.) Before anyone jumps to typical judgment, let me pose a question in the form of a thought I have... I try to think what it might be like if the tables were turned. If my boyfriend were here and there were some other men, but THOUSANDS of women. Not to mention, the majority of them would be young, in shape and extremely attractive. And everywhere he went they looked at him like he was a god. Essentially throwing themselves at him and willing to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. The attention would be relentless, every day, every hour, ever where you went. To escape and prevent it if you wanted to, you would have to hold yourself up in your room, never eat, never go to the gym or never go to work. How long do you think he could resist?",

(Especially if you are a very attractive female.) Before anyone jumps to typical judgment, let me pose a question in the form of a thought I have... I try to think what it might be like if the tables were turned. If my boyfriend were here and there were some other men, but THOUSANDS of women. Not to mention, the majority of them would be young, in shape and extremely attractive. And everywhere he went they looked at him like he was a god. Essentially throwing themselves at him and willing to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. The attention would be relentless, every day, every hour, ever where you went. To escape and prevent it if you wanted to, you would have to hold yourself up in your room, never eat, never go to the gym or never go to work. How long do you think he could resist?",

I have been searching and searching online for something about female soldiers cheating during deployment and everything is always about the \"male\" soldier and how he cheated or how his lady cheated. I am currently deployed to Iraq and am the quintessential 'FOBIT.' Without going into too much detail I want to know if there is anyone out there who might be able to relate to what it is like to in a loving supportive relationship back at home, but cheated while deployed because the temptation is relentless. (Especially if you are a very attractive female.) Before anyone jumps to typical judgment, let me pose a question in the form of a thought I have... I try to think what it might be like if the tables were turned. If my boyfriend were here and there were some other men, but THOUSANDS of women. Not to mention, the majority of them would be young, in shape and extremely attractive. And everywhere he went they looked at him like he was a god. Essentially throwing themselves at him and willing to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. The attention would be relentless, every day, every hour, ever where you went. To escape and prevent it if you wanted to, you would have to hold yourself up in your room, never eat, never go to the gym or never go to work. How long do you think he could resist?",

I am currently deployed to Iraq and am the quintessential 'FOBIT.' Without going into too much detail I want to know if there is anyone out there who might be able to relate to what it is like to in a loving supportive relationship back at home, but cheated while deployed because the temptation is relentless. (Especially if you are a very attractive female.) Before anyone jumps to typical judgment, let me pose a question in the form of a thought I have... I try to think what it might be like if the tables were turned. If my boyfriend were here and there were some other men, but THOUSANDS of women. Not to mention, the majority of them would be young, in shape and extremely attractive. And everywhere he went they looked at him like he was a god. Essentially throwing themselves at him and willing to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. The attention would be relentless, every day, every hour, ever where you went. To escape and prevent it if you wanted to, you would have to hold yourself up in your room, never eat, never go to the gym or never go to work. How long do you think he could resist?",
