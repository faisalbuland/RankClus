I called her this morning, she just has a bunch of health issues. One of her son's is in poor health, he had a heart valve replaced last year. Now thats failing, he can't walk very far, he gets winded. They can't operate until he gets better, he's on medication to help him, once he is better, they will replace the valve. One of her daughters has Scleroderma, she is going down hill. Prayers please! It's time to get to church, see yall later! Bergy Keep smiling, everyone will wonder what you've been up to!",
