What is the time in country required to rate that ribbon? In the grunts is one thing maybe perhaps marsoc has different criteria. This guys a 3 year PFC and he's a P.O.S so we're thinking he's full of it. Let me know, Tango.",

Get on of the old timers to talk with the guy and he'll be able to tell you if the guy is blowing smoke or not 99% of the time. 4) Three year PFC? Possible, start as low man on the totem pole, and advance only well after the minimums for time in grade. Or get busted down from a higher grade, lose a stripe from changing specialties, rerating, or sometimes for changing branches of service(not common but I know two guys that went through it). 5) If you want to make it a formal matter, your six better be covered well enough to stop a nuclear salvo, they take charges like this seriously. \u201cIf you bring these leaders to trial, it will condemn the North, for by the Constitution, secession is not rebellion...His (Jeff Davis') capture was a mistake. His trial will be a greater one. We cannot convict him of treason.\" Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, 1867.",
