Go Google \"GED prep test.\" There are lots and lots of free sites to help you prepare for it. Then go to any local community college and take the GED test and pass it (was about 2 hours when I took it). Then you're golden! My best wishes to you! Oh, and if you're seriously considering serving, get some free websites up for the ASVAB pre-test. They will help you immensely, as the ASVAB score will dictate what you can \"do\" (MOS) in the military, which branch(es) you can serve in, and etc. The higher the score, the more options; the more options, the better for you. Again, my best wishes! It's not that there is no God or that He isn't listening. You're probably just asking the wrong questions.",
