Funny how in this 21st century world of pocket digital cameras and camera phones, no one ever takes pictures of the bullcrap they claim to have witnessed. Anyway, highly disappointed in history channel's programming choice for tomorrow. I actually planned to tune in about lunch time to see if there were any good WW2 programs on. Looks like thats a negative.",
