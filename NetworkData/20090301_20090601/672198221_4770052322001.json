I hope people come to their senses quickly and start to reverse the single party rule in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Hopefully the Republican leadership will have pulled their heads out of their collective a**es and returned to core values of smaller government, lower taxes, and fiscal responsibility. Both parties need to cooperate and come up with meaningful but not overbearing regulations to keep this kind of economic meltdown from happening again. \"social responsability\" is not just about hard working people carrying the lazy. it is about the \"lazier\" people having the RESPONSABILITY of contributing to the table. i see a lot of accusations towards Mr O. about being a socialist, and yet our ENTIRE welfare system, our social security system and out police system are modeled after Marxist ideals. we all know where those led to. Broke Social security Gestapo=like department of Homeland security (in its structure, not its attitude... YET) and a welfare system that is used by the least qualified, while the most qualified are on the streets. Mr Obama is thrust into the fray and is swinging his sword in any way that can gain him an advantage i'll say this onthe record.: where as i do not agree with everything he is doing, he is, AT LEAST, thinking and plannin g. before implementing the plan he is putting it forth for review and tweaking. he is already 100% better thamn chenney and his puppet presidemnt, but then i think joe the plumber would have been a better choice for america than Bush",
