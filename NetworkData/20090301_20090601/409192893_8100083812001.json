All three go with a White House official to examine the fence.

How did you come up with such a high figure?\" The Chicago contractor whispers back, \"$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from Tennessee to fix the fence.\" \"Done!\" replies the government official. And that, my friends, is how the new stimulus plan will work.* \"Diplomacy is utterly useless when there is no force behind it; the diplomat is the servant, not the master of the soldier.\" THEODORE ROOSEVELT",

The White House grounds-keeper reported it to his superiors who, of course, notified the Office of The Vice President. The VP called some \"friends\" at Halliburton and told them to submit a no-bid contract request. They did and it was approved that afternoon for $1.2 million. Halliburton handed off the contract, via their KBR affiliate, to Kuwait Partners Ltd (a joint venture between the Kuwaiti royal family, Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia and the Carlysle Group) who, in turn, passed the job to a West German construction company. They hired half a dozen Somalian's for roughly $1 per hour US, obtained 30 day work visas from our State Department on an emergency basis, then brought them here and hired them out as security guards at the Lincoln Memorial to the Brazilian firm which provides that service. The Somalian's are still here, even though their work visas expired long ago, and the fence is not fixed. Halliburton billed the US government for $200 million in cost over-runs, which was paid.",
