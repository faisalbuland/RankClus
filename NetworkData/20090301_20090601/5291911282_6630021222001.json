He dodged the economy issue, but we know all the questions are pre-screened and there is no allowance or openings for any 'surprise' questions like he got hit with by \"Joe the Plumber\" during the campaign.",

Now, let's say yer in an NBC/CBR situation and all geared/masked up, but you either get the signal that it's all clear, or you think the threat is passed, but either way, you don't have any testing kits to confirm it. What is the procedure in the book to determine the situation?? In both cases, you pick the lowest ranked, least necessary person and send him across, or have him momentarily unmask and observe what happens to him - right? That is reality...
