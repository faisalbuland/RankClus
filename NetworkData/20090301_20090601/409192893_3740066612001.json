Whether it be led by the people or the state governments we will eventually have to try to do to our own federal government what the Founding Fathers did to the British.

Respectfully, SUNLINER81 Yes, it is total idiocy that we the people and the States have allowed the federal government to usurp so much the states rights and power. Now with 31 states in the works for this it is time to start ignoring the federal government all together and reclaim what is rightfully the states authority. Even my home state of California is doing so when it comes to Marijuana, so hopefully some day even California will see the light totally and spit in Washington DC's perverbial face, the sooner the better. Sunliner you cannot force fifty states to do anything, maybe even 31 if they do not recognize your authority. I am with the states that have voted for Sovereignty and God Bless the Kingdom of Hawaii, since it last sitting ruler was over thrown by the United States! Frisco This message has been edited.

Now with 31 states in the works for this it is time to start ignoring the federal government all together and reclaim what is rightfully the states authority. Even my home state of California is doing so when it comes to Marijuana, so hopefully some day even California will see the light totally and spit in Washington DC's perverbial face, the sooner the better. Sunliner you cannot force fifty states to do anything, maybe even 31 if they do not recognize your authority. I am with the states that have voted for Sovereignty and God Bless the Kingdom of Hawaii, since it last sitting ruler was over thrown by the United States! Frisco This message has been edited.

We have a bunch of bumbling idiots in charge of the treasury, and the country's future, who don't understand that you can't borrow money to pay off your debt -- but that is exactly what Obama is doing by signing his so-called, \"stimulus bill.\" Obama and the 111th Congress are the biggest bunch of over-reachers and underachievers we've ever had, and Obama's $1 trillion stimulus plan is the last straw -- taxing state patience, and resulting in the brewing sovereignty dispute. It is time to refuse the unfunded mandates, audit the cost the federal programs like Medicaid, and the impact it is having on the states both financially and socially. Sadly, far too many Americans are woefully ignorant when it comes to understanding their rights and the Constitution. As Gary Alder notes in his \u201c15 Key Principles of the Founding Fathers,\u201d the \u201c9th and 10th Amendments are the keystones to preserving Freedom.\u201d In fact, the first 10 amendments, known as the Bill of (Individual) Rights, clarify the restraints placed on the national government and they safeguard the rights of individuals. It does not take a rocket scientist to conclude that all of these individual rights are under withereing attack by the federal government. \u201cObama\u2019s plans for a federal handgun license, \u2018hate crimes\u2019 laws to regulate Christians\u2019 speech about their own religious beliefs on homosexuality, President Obama\u2019s youth corps for mandatory public service and the so-called \u2018Fairness Doctrine\u2019 to \u2018balance\u2019 talk radio have New Hampshire Lawmakers telling Obama to basically grow up and get some better ideas,\u201d writes Jake Jones. \u201cThey say that if Obama\u2019s plans are implimented, it would constitute a nullification of the Constitution for the United States.\u201d Unfortunately, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were nullified many years ago, at least since the emergence of the Federalists under Alexander Hamilton, as Thomas J. DiLorenzo persausively argues. \u201cFederalists like Joseph Story and John Marshall, and later Whig politicians like Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln\u2026 would tell The Big Lie that the Constitution was ratified by \u2018the whole people\u2019 and not as it actually was \u2013 by the citizens of the sovereign states, with their representatives assembled in state conventions,\u201d writes DiLorenzo. In the years since, the reach and severity of federalism has grown expotentially. \u201cThe U.S. government is now characterized by dictatorial power, abuse of every kind of personal liberty, confiscatory taxation, economic fascism, dangerous militarism, and imperialism.\u201d New World Order minion Obama will take this dictatorial power to new heights under the pretense of saving the people from the bankster engineered global economic depression. As Obama and Congress further extend the dictatorial reach of the federal government \u2014 under the control of a small cotorie of globalists and international bankers \u2014 we can expect more states to assert their rights under the Constitution and the Tenth Amendment. The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" TJ CAPT-DAX",

It does not take a rocket scientist to conclude that all of these individual rights are under withereing attack by the federal government. \u201cObama\u2019s plans for a federal handgun license, \u2018hate crimes\u2019 laws to regulate Christians\u2019 speech about their own religious beliefs on homosexuality, President Obama\u2019s youth corps for mandatory public service and the so-called \u2018Fairness Doctrine\u2019 to \u2018balance\u2019 talk radio have New Hampshire Lawmakers telling Obama to basically grow up and get some better ideas,\u201d writes Jake Jones. \u201cThey say that if Obama\u2019s plans are implimented, it would constitute a nullification of the Constitution for the United States.\u201d Unfortunately, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were nullified many years ago, at least since the emergence of the Federalists under Alexander Hamilton, as Thomas J. DiLorenzo persausively argues. \u201cFederalists like Joseph Story and John Marshall, and later Whig politicians like Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln\u2026 would tell The Big Lie that the Constitution was ratified by \u2018the whole people\u2019 and not as it actually was \u2013 by the citizens of the sovereign states, with their representatives assembled in state conventions,\u201d writes DiLorenzo. In the years since, the reach and severity of federalism has grown expotentially. \u201cThe U.S. government is now characterized by dictatorial power, abuse of every kind of personal liberty, confiscatory taxation, economic fascism, dangerous militarism, and imperialism.\u201d New World Order minion Obama will take this dictatorial power to new heights under the pretense of saving the people from the bankster engineered global economic depression. As Obama and Congress further extend the dictatorial reach of the federal government \u2014 under the control of a small cotorie of globalists and international bankers \u2014 we can expect more states to assert their rights under the Constitution and the Tenth Amendment. The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" TJ CAPT-DAX",

Now, I agree, the feds should have no authority other than national defense, foreign relations, interstate business and finance, but the sad fact is the federal government now is so large it can't go back. Government seeks to preserve itself.", 
        "reply": " And you are so totally correct on all points. As much as I would love to see a little civil disobedience from the states. You are correct on your last point as well, so unfortunately what does that leave us? Whether it be led by the people or the state governments we will eventually have to try to do to our own federal government what the Founding Fathers did to the British. The feds must be stopped from further infringment on both personal and state rights at some point or what is the sense of having state and local government. Just control all from Imperial Rome, i.e. Washington DC. Either choice is not a pretty sight. Frisco",

First, let's remember that it was I, who here on another thread, said that I would whole heartedly support the President UNTIL he demonstrated that he was NOT worthy of that support. As a conservative, evangelical Christian, I believe that President Obama is dangerously close to demonstrating that unworthiness. The State of Oklahoma is at the forefront of the Soverenty movement. We believe, and I support that the Constitution of the United States is being usurped by those in government simply for the purpose of maintaining their power through entitlement programs that cannot be sustained without invoking socialist tendacies. It is NOT the perview of the United States government to pay homeowner mortgages. It is not the perview of the United States government to save a failed industry (auto). It is not the perview of the United States government to push social engineering and it is certainly not the perview of the United States government to use taxes to punish success. We are trying to get the state and its cities to refuse all of the stimulus money. The governor's office and the major cities in Oklahoma are held by Democrats though. They see 3.2 TRILLION dollar budget and the first thing they do is hold their hand out. Oklahoma does not need it and the majority do not want it. Oklahoma's employment is up; sales and home starts are up; auto loans are up; our budget is in the black and we are putting money away for a rainy day. We do not choose to be counted along with those states who's failed policies have brought them to their knees (refer to California's Illegal Alien policies INCLUDING the sanctuary cities policy). For the first time in 105 years Oklahoma has a Republican Senate and House and we are slashing taxes and making a pro-business atmosphere. For all those states who hate Exxon-Mobil, we say knock yourselves out. They can come here and we'll pass laws to protect them from punative lawsuits. So much for liberal policies and their outcomes...",

        "reply": "The tenth amendment to the Constitution: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" Stillkit would like us to believe that the government of the United is of, by and for the people of the United States. First, let's remember that it was I, who here on another thread, said that I would whole heartedly support the President UNTIL he demonstrated that he was NOT worthy of that support. As a conservative, evangelical Christian, I believe that President Obama is dangerously close to demonstrating that unworthiness. The State of Oklahoma is at the forefront of the Soverenty movement. We believe, and I support that the Constitution of the United States is being usurped by those in government simply for the purpose of maintaining their power through entitlement programs that cannot be sustained without invoking socialist tendacies. It is NOT the perview of the United States government to pay homeowner mortgages. It is not the perview of the United States government to save a failed industry (auto). It is not the perview of the United States government to push social engineering and it is certainly not the perview of the United States government to use taxes to punish success. We are trying to get the state and its cities to refuse all of the stimulus money. The governor's office and the major cities in Oklahoma are held by Democrats though. They see 3.2 TRILLION dollar budget and the first thing they do is hold their hand out. Oklahoma does not need it and the majority do not want it. Oklahoma's employment is up; sales and home starts are up; auto loans are up; our budget is in the black and we are putting money away for a rainy day. We do not choose to be counted along with those states who's failed policies have brought them to their knees (refer to California's Illegal Alien policies INCLUDING the sanctuary cities policy). For the first time in 105 years Oklahoma has a Republican Senate and House and we are slashing taxes and making a pro-business atmosphere. For all those states who hate Exxon-Mobil, we say knock yourselves out. They can come here and we'll pass laws to protect them from punative lawsuits. So much for liberal policies and their outcomes...",
