However, the Swedish corvettes HMS Malm\u00f6 and HMS Stockholm have been patroling the Somali coast for a short while and did their first intervention against pirates today. Aprox 0130 at night an alarm went out from A/V Antonis, a merchant ship, stating she was under attack from pirates with RPG's and needed help. HMS Malm\u00f6 and HMS Stockholm were ordered to assist her and headed to intercept.
