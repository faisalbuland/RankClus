It predates my service with this great institution, and it will be around long after I\u2019m gone. But the political debates about interrogation reached a new decibel level yesterday when the CIA was accused of misleading Congress. Let me be clear: It is not our policy or practice to mislead Congress. That is against our laws and our values. As the Agency indicated previously in response to Congressional inquiries, our contemporaneous records from September 2002 indicate that CIA officers briefed truthfully on the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, describing \u201cthe enhanced techniques that had been employed.\u201d Ultimately, it is up to Congress to evaluate all the evidence and reach its own conclusions about what happened. My advice \u2014 indeed, my direction \u2014 to you is straightforward: ignore the noise and stay focused on your mission. We have too much work to do to be distracted from our job of protecting this country. We are an Agency of high integrity, professionalism, and dedication. Our task is to tell it like it is \u2014 even if that\u2019s not what people always want to hear. Keep it up. Our national security depends on it. So a career democrat is now saying that the CIA told the truth. Hmmm, who should we believe?",
