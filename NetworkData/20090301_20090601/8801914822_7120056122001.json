Fifty-six Chinese subs, destroyers, frigates, missile boats and planes were displayed off the eastern port city of Qingdao just weeks after tensions flared after a naval stand-off with the U.S. in the South China Sea. The review - only the fourth to take place since 1949 and the first on such a large and international scale - was opened by two of China's nuclear-powered submarines, the first time in history they have been unveiled to the public. President Hu Jintao boarded the destroyer Shijiazhuang, after having sought to reassure the heads of foreign navy delegations that China's maritime power posed no threat to anyone. (...) Ships from 14 countries, including the U.S., Russia and France, took part in the fleet review, which Chinese officials have said is aimed at promoting understanding about China's military development. (...) Early this month, China's dispatch of civilian patrol vessels to waters around disputed islands in the same sea - the Spratlys - sparked concern in the Philippines, which also claims sovereignty over the archipelago. (...) Sixty years ago, the PLA's navy was formed when a unit of the Kuomintang's coastal defense fleet defected to the rival communists, bringing with it nine warships and 17 other boats.",
