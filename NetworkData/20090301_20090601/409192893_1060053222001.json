I don't think you'll see another bush enter national politics for a long long time! Memories of the last eight years will not go quitely into the night. I actually heard Ann Coulter say last night on Larry King Live (which I was astonished), that she hopes Sarah Palin stays in Alaska for another 4-6 years. All of this tells me the GOP \"may be\" starting to use a \"new\" strategy that is outside its past history of \"same old GOP.\" We shall see....... This message has been edited.

Barry Goldwater, though maligned by many, was almost prescient, as shown in his book, \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" The following passages below are excerpts from Barry Goldwater's 1960 book The Conscience of a Conservative--specifically his chapter \"The Perils of Power\". He wrote these words, of course, when the Soviet Union was still the world's only other superpower and owned thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at the United States. quote: ... Such, then, is history's lesson, which Messrs. Acheson and Larson evidently did not read: release the holders of state power from any restraints other than those they wish to impose upon themselves, and you are swinging down the well-travelled road to absolutism. The framers of the Constitution had learned the lesson. They were not only students of history, but victims of it: they knew from vivid, personal experience that freedom depends on effective restraints against the accumulation of power in a single authority. And that is what the Constitution is: a system of restraints against the natural tendency of government to expand in the direction of absolutism. ... ... But the framers were not visionaries. They knew that rules of government, however brilliantly calculated to cope with the imperfect nature of man, however carefully designed to avoid the pitfalls of power, would be no match for men who were determined to disregard them. In the last analysis their system of government would prosper only if the governed were sufficiently determined that it should. \"What have you given us?\" a woman asked Ben Franklin toward the close of the Constitutional Convention. \"A Republic,\" he said, \"if you can keep it!\" ... ... The Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, probably the most clairvoyant political observer of modern times, saw the danger when he visited this country in the 1830's. Even then he foresaw decay for a society that tended to put more emphasis on its democracy than its republicanism. He predicted that America would produce, not tyrants but \"guardians\". And that the American people would \"console themselves for being in tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians. Every man allows himself to be put in lead-strings, because he sees that it is not a person nor a class of persons, but the people at large that hold the end of his chain.\" Our tendency to concentrate power in the hands of a few men deeply concerns me. We can be conquered by bombs or by subversion; but we can also be conquered by neglect--by ignoring the Constitution and disregarding the principles of limited government. Our defenses against the accumulation of unlimited power in Washington are in poorer shape, I fear, than our defenses against the aggressive designs of Moscow. Like so many other nations before us, we may succumb through internal weakness rather than fall before a foreign foe. I am convinced that most Americans now want to reverse the trend. I think that concern for our vanishing freedoms is genuine. I think that the people's uneasiness in the stifling omnipresence of government has turned into something approaching alarm. But bemoaning the evil will not drive it back, and accusing fingers will not shrink government. The turn will come when we entrust the conduct of our affairs to men who understand that their first duty as public officials is to divest themselves of the power they have been given. It will come when Americans, in the hundreds of communities throughout the nation, decide to put the man in office who is pledged to enforce the Constitution and restore the Republic. Who will proclaim in a campaign speech: \"I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for I mean to reduce its size. I do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them. It is not to inaugurate new programs, but to cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have failed in their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted financial burden. I will not attempt to discover whether legislation is 'needed' before I have first determined whether it is constitutionally permissible. And if I should later be attacked for neglecting my constituents' 'interests,' I shall reply that I was informed their main interest is liberty and that in that cause I am doing the very best I can.\" \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",

He wrote these words, of course, when the Soviet Union was still the world's only other superpower and owned thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at the United States.  \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",

In spite of the last election, I'm still convinced that a TRUE Conservative could stroll right into the White House without breaking a sweat. Point taken CPT. But what if that conservative still had an (R) after their name? Could they still waltz right into the WH? Maybe it's 3rd Party Time? I heard radio jocks Michael Savage and Rusty Humphries just recently say they don't want to be aligned with the GOP anymore. Interesting comment from those two to say the least! Savage of course is the most vocal against the party. They will of course continue with their conservative mantra, just minus the Grand Old Party. Interesting stuff! Of course a real conservative could be elected with an R before his name. Contrary to popular opinion, the Republican Party isn't dead yet. It will be back. It only remains to be seen what ideology will be driving it when it returns. Right now, there appears to be two schools of thought on how to resurrect the GOP. 1. Hold fast to the \"new\" Conservatism and wait for the Obama administration to fail. In fact, HELP it fail, thereby opening an opportunity to say, \"We told you so,\" and ride back into power. 2. Move the party to the center. In other words, become more like the Democrats. Nobody in the party is suggesting a return to true Conservatism: smaller government which is less intrusive on our lives, fiscal responsibility, an America First foreign policy and the military power to defend it. That just seems to be off the table. Of the two schools of thought above, the first one has the best chance to succeed in returning the party to power, but the least likely to be good for America. My opinion is that they had their chance and wrecked the country because their first priority seems to have been serving their corporate masters rather than The People. The second school of thought is based upon the same mis-reading of the last election which the Democrats have fallen into: That the election of Obama was a vote for liberalism. It was not. It was a vote AGAINST George Bush, which isn't the same thing. I'm more and more convinced that radical liberalism still does not enjoy wide public support, that the majority of our citizens are still truly conservative at heart, but the Democrats don't see that. In their zeal and enthusiasm at winning power, they're going off the deep end with extreme liberalism and thereby ensuring their own defeat down the road. Americans will reject it in the end. Those who suggest the Republican Party should become more like the Democrats are buying into the same misunderstanding and, if they have their way with the party, future elections will revolve around nothing more than buying votes by promising the moon. Ultimately, a few cycles of the GOP and Demos both trying to outspend each other will lead to catastrophe. At some point, a true Conservative WILL arise in one party or another and he'll win the election hands down. Either that, or America is doomed.",

In spite of the last election, I'm still convinced that a TRUE Conservative could stroll right into the White House without breaking a sweat. Point taken CPT. But what if that conservative still had an (R) after their name? Could they still waltz right into the WH? Maybe it's 3rd Party Time? I heard radio jocks Michael Savage and Rusty Humphries just recently say they don't want to be aligned with the GOP anymore. Interesting comment from those two to say the least! Savage of course is the most vocal against the party. They will of course continue with their conservative mantra, just minus the Grand Old Party. Interesting stuff!", 
        "reply": " Of course a real conservative could be elected with an R before his name. Contrary to popular opinion, the Republican Party isn't dead yet. It will be back. It only remains to be seen what ideology will be driving it when it returns. Right now, there appears to be two schools of thought on how to resurrect the GOP. 1. Hold fast to the \"new\" Conservatism and wait for the Obama administration to fail. In fact, HELP it fail, thereby opening an opportunity to say, \"We told you so,\" and ride back into power. 2. Move the party to the center. In other words, become more like the Democrats. Nobody in the party is suggesting a return to true Conservatism: smaller government which is less intrusive on our lives, fiscal responsibility, an America First foreign policy and the military power to defend it. That just seems to be off the table. Of the two schools of thought above, the first one has the best chance to succeed in returning the party to power, but the least likely to be good for America. My opinion is that they had their chance and wrecked the country because their first priority seems to have been serving their corporate masters rather than The People. The second school of thought is based upon the same mis-reading of the last election which the Democrats have fallen into: That the election of Obama was a vote for liberalism. It was not. It was a vote AGAINST George Bush, which isn't the same thing. I'm more and more convinced that radical liberalism still does not enjoy wide public support, that the majority of our citizens are still truly conservative at heart, but the Democrats don't see that. In their zeal and enthusiasm at winning power, they're going off the deep end with extreme liberalism and thereby ensuring their own defeat down the road. Americans will reject it in the end. Those who suggest the Republican Party should become more like the Democrats are buying into the same misunderstanding and, if they have their way with the party, future elections will revolve around nothing more than buying votes by promising the moon. Ultimately, a few cycles of the GOP and Demos both trying to outspend each other will lead to catastrophe. At some point, a true Conservative WILL arise in one party or another and he'll win the election hands down. Either that, or America is doomed.",

        "content": "My $0.02 ***Below taken from \"http://madwriter.livejournal.com/401278.html\" AU H20, memories...... Barry Goldwater, though maligned by many, was almost prescient, as shown in his book, \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" The following passages below are excerpts from Barry Goldwater's 1960 book The Conscience of a Conservative--specifically his chapter \"The Perils of Power\". He wrote these words, of course, when the Soviet Union was still the world's only other superpower and owned thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at the United States. quote: ... Such, then, is history's lesson, which Messrs. Acheson and Larson evidently did not read: release the holders of state power from any restraints other than those they wish to impose upon themselves, and you are swinging down the well-travelled road to absolutism. The framers of the Constitution had learned the lesson. They were not only students of history, but victims of it: they knew from vivid, personal experience that freedom depends on effective restraints against the accumulation of power in a single authority. And that is what the Constitution is: a system of restraints against the natural tendency of government to expand in the direction of absolutism. ... ... But the framers were not visionaries. They knew that rules of government, however brilliantly calculated to cope with the imperfect nature of man, however carefully designed to avoid the pitfalls of power, would be no match for men who were determined to disregard them. In the last analysis their system of government would prosper only if the governed were sufficiently determined that it should. \"What have you given us?\" a woman asked Ben Franklin toward the close of the Constitutional Convention. \"A Republic,\" he said, \"if you can keep it!\" ... ... The Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, probably the most clairvoyant political observer of modern times, saw the danger when he visited this country in the 1830's. Even then he foresaw decay for a society that tended to put more emphasis on its democracy than its republicanism. He predicted that America would produce, not tyrants but \"guardians\". And that the American people would \"console themselves for being in tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians. Every man allows himself to be put in lead-strings, because he sees that it is not a person nor a class of persons, but the people at large that hold the end of his chain.\" Our tendency to concentrate power in the hands of a few men deeply concerns me. We can be conquered by bombs or by subversion; but we can also be conquered by neglect--by ignoring the Constitution and disregarding the principles of limited government. Our defenses against the accumulation of unlimited power in Washington are in poorer shape, I fear, than our defenses against the aggressive designs of Moscow. Like so many other nations before us, we may succumb through internal weakness rather than fall before a foreign foe. I am convinced that most Americans now want to reverse the trend. I think that concern for our vanishing freedoms is genuine. I think that the people's uneasiness in the stifling omnipresence of government has turned into something approaching alarm. But bemoaning the evil will not drive it back, and accusing fingers will not shrink government. The turn will come when we entrust the conduct of our affairs to men who understand that their first duty as public officials is to divest themselves of the power they have been given. It will come when Americans, in the hundreds of communities throughout the nation, decide to put the man in office who is pledged to enforce the Constitution and restore the Republic. Who will proclaim in a campaign speech: \"I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for I mean to reduce its size. I do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them. It is not to inaugurate new programs, but to cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have failed in their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted financial burden. I will not attempt to discover whether legislation is 'needed' before I have first determined whether it is constitutionally permissible. And if I should later be attacked for neglecting my constituents' 'interests,' I shall reply that I was informed their main interest is liberty and that in that cause I am doing the very best I can.\" \"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life.\" ~~~Theodore Roosevelt~~~",

In spite of the last election, I'm still convinced that a TRUE Conservative could stroll right into the White House without breaking a sweat. Point taken CPT. But what if that conservative still had an (R) after their name? Could they still waltz right into the WH? Maybe it's 3rd Party Time? I heard radio jocks Michael Savage and Rusty Humphries just recently say they don't want to be aligned with the GOP anymore. Interesting comment from those two to say the least! Savage of course is the most vocal against the party. They will of course continue with their conservative mantra, just minus the Grand Old Party. Interesting stuff! Of course a real conservative could be elected with an R before his name. Contrary to popular opinion, the Republican Party isn't dead yet. It will be back. It only remains to be seen what ideology will be driving it when it returns. Right now, there appears to be two schools of thought on how to resurrect the GOP. 1. Hold fast to the \"new\" Conservatism and wait for the Obama administration to fail. In fact, HELP it fail, thereby opening an opportunity to say, \"We told you so,\" and ride back into power. 2. Move the party to the center. In other words, become more like the Democrats. Nobody in the party is suggesting a return to true Conservatism: smaller government which is less intrusive on our lives, fiscal responsibility, an America First foreign policy and the military power to defend it. That just seems to be off the table. Of the two schools of thought above, the first one has the best chance to succeed in returning the party to power, but the least likely to be good for America. My opinion is that they had their chance and wrecked the country because their first priority seems to have been serving their corporate masters rather than The People. The second school of thought is based upon the same mis-reading of the last election which the Democrats have fallen into: That the election of Obama was a vote for liberalism. It was not. It was a vote AGAINST George Bush, which isn't the same thing. I'm more and more convinced that radical liberalism still does not enjoy wide public support, that the majority of our citizens are still truly conservative at heart, but the Democrats don't see that. In their zeal and enthusiasm at winning power, they're going off the deep end with extreme liberalism and thereby ensuring their own defeat down the road. Americans will reject it in the end. Those who suggest the Republican Party should become more like the Democrats are buying into the same misunderstanding and, if they have their way with the party, future elections will revolve around nothing more than buying votes by promising the moon. Ultimately, a few cycles of the GOP and Demos both trying to outspend each other will lead to catastrophe. At some point, a true Conservative WILL arise in one party or another and he'll win the election hands down. Either that, or America is doomed.",
