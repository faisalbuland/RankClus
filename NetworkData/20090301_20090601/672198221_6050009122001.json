Granted some of the military is going to be affected. However, the main force will actually gain benefits from these cuts. I have yet to figure out who we are competing with for air or sea superiority. Seems like we have too few, expensive items to do the job. Maybe we need more less expensive ones. We can't even stop pirates in row boats. The industry, its lobbyists, and the brass don't seem to care about winning the war or keeping the troops safe. Trust me, you can kill a pirate just as easy (maybe easier) with a P-51 as you can with an F-35.",
