If his Permanent Party Posting destination is here in the States, he may be given several days - even a week to report. Now, if that destination takes him physically past home, he may be granted a short \"Delay enroute\" to stop off for a while. He may even be allowed to take some of his \"accrued leave\" - a week or so - but he would have to request that and work it out before orders are cut. If his Permanent Party Posting is overseas, he will most likely be given a certain amount of leave to go home before going overseas, because once he leaves for there, he will be gone from one to three years before another Permanent Party Posting. So it really depends on where he will be sent to become a Permanent Party member of a unit, and whether that Posting will cause him to travel in the direction of home, or overseas - - Wandering and Wondering",
