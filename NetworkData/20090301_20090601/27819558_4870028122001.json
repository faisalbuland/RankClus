Gottfried Enslin was kicked out of the Army at Valley Forge, we are going to concentrate on what is generally referred to as the modern gay veterans movement and particularly on Gay Lesbian Bisexual Veterans of America (GLBVA), now American Veterans for Equal Rights (AVER). We know that there were gay local veterans organizations forming around this country at about the same time that gay organizations were coming into existence. Following WWII most of these groups were local. At the first GLBT March on Washington (MOW) in 1987, GLBT veterans who were meeting other GLBT veterans began to realize the need and the value for having a national GLBT veterans organization. Members from across California\u2019s Veterans C.A.R.E. were the largest group at the March. Returning home from the MOW communication began among some of these groups to form a national group. In 1989, Cliff Arnesen and Stan Berry from New England Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Veterans of America traveled to Washington, DC to give oral testimony at the U.S. House Subcommittee on Oversight and Veterans Affairs. In 1990 six veterans who were in attendance at the NGLTF Creating Change Conference in Minneapolis in February formed a veterans organization and named it Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Veterans of America. Most of them came from local GLBT veterans groups. Read more at >>>http://www.thegaymilitarytimes.com/0905HistoryII.html",
