The USMC is an admirable group, and have done great things, but they have spread out to the point that they are redundent. If any group should be \"reallocated\" it is them, but they have a lot of sentiment on their side. No one will vote to eliminate or significantly reduce such a justly proud organization. I agree with his statement on \"up or out\" - however much it seems to come from his own bad experience. The only advantage I see to this policy is that it feeds veterans back into the civilian world, but does so at the cost of our active military. This is the only one of his proposals with a snowball's chance of passing. \"National Service\"? NOT ... GOING ... TO ... HAPPEN! Barring WWIII, Congress will not commit the mass suicide of instituting a draft. My thinking exactly, gentlemen. I am forever reading how the USAf can be disbanded, but yet I never see these guys recommend similar action for their own services. I generally find it is total ignorance of understanding waht a total force is all about. Plus I have been reading this crap for 32 years which explains my general pizz-off attitude everytime one of these posts comes up. Burns my azz more than a flame 4 foot high. The up-or-out sitiuation is a double-edged sword. Why force out an O-4 if all he wants to do is fly acft? If he is good at it, let him roll. But he does continually fill a slot someone esle will not be promoted into. Same with enlisted that is why there is/was a HYT policy. The USN board thing sounds a bit too much, but if it works for them.....",
