My advice to young people who desire to do something with your lives that will benefit and/or perhaps even save a human life, is to consider going into the medical, firefighting, law enforcement, educational, political/judicial, constructional fields to name a few. Why learn how to destroy lives when you can learn how to save them instead? ------------------------------------------------ Oh I don't know. Maybe because Doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges and firefighters can't do a damn thing to stop things like this before they happen? I left out law enforcement because A. they can, but B. with all those guns they're only slightly less \"life destroying\" and violent as us savage \"armymen\". Ignorance like the above needs to be encased in lucite and preserved in some museum like a dinosaur skeleton.",
