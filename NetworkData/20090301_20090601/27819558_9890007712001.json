For Being Gay U.S. Army Discharges Soldiers For Violating \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" Policy (CBS/AP) The U.S. Army fired 11 soldiers in January for violating the military's policy that gay service members must keep their sexuality hidden, according to a congressman. Democratic Rep. Jim Moran said he has requested monthly updates from the Pentagon on the impact of the policy until it is repealed. In a statement released on Thursday, Moran said the discharged soldiers included an intelligence collector, a military police officer, four infantry personnel, a health care specialist, a motor-transport operator and a water-treatment specialist. \"How many more good soldiers are we willing to lose due to a bad policy that makes us less safe and secure?\" asked Moran, a member of the House panel that oversees military spending.

Will it make its origin less despicable? How has DA/DT worked well? For who? Have you a number of homosexual service personnel jumping on the band wagon say \"this is great!\". I have not met any, either active or retired or vets. They all believe it is wrong (DA/DT). And just what's wrong with gays serving freely, honestly without \"special\" constraints? What is it you don't trust about them? Why do you suppose homosexuals are not jumping on your 'we-can-do-it-better-as-heterosexual' management policy? Why not let the gay service personnel, both active and vets, come up with a solution? What do you suppose they would say? 'Fine tune' or turn it off and get on with defending our nation?",

As you requested, I've rethought my posting style and found that it is a reflection of my personality. As such, I found your request to be one that's....insurmountable, as I cannot change my God given personality. The fact that you spend more time monitoring me than others causes me concern that you're simply looking for an excuse to be rid of me. Having read the TOS one more time....again as you suggested....I cannot find where I've violated it. Please point it out to me so that I might avoid doing so henceforth. In this particular instance, I've \"badmouthed\" no one; neither have I told ANYONE what to do. I DID request a definition in the context of an ongoing debate. As an example of something insurmountable, I'd use the example of proving that....two equals one. I sought an example of something insurmountable from another poster in the context of our ongoing debate. To say that I was shocked that you interceded in that debate and appeared to be taking a side seemed to me to reflect an egregious bias. Perhaps I misinterpreted your intervention, but....I remain concerned for an objective violation of the TOS. I hope that you'll not restrict my future here because you dislike my contributions!",
