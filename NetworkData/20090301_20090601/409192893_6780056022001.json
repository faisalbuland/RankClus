You wouldn't want to be two faced hypocrites and disagree with that assessment, would you?... Mike, if I may also play devils advocate for a moment. I'm a Bushie Republican and a Neocon, and damn proud of it! President Bush did absolutely nothing to warrant any criticism or any bashing as POTUS and CIC of the US armed forces. Regardless of what he authorized the US armed forces to do, in individual incidents, and in major operations, ie Iraq, he was always right! Because he was a devout Christian, he was never wrong. We all know that devout believers in Christianity are never wrong anyway! I voted McCain/Palin because I knew they would continue in the noble traditions of George W. Bush! Had they been voted into office, we would not be in this horrible and tragic mess today. GW Bush did not create this mess! This nobody nobama which people incorrectly call the president of the USA is a muslim, and enemy to America and its Christain values. He was not even born here, that has been proven! He is purposely trying to bankrupt our country! GW Bush had good/sound economic policies and left out country in the black. nobama has put it in the red! This upstart is another Hitler, and trying to turn our country into another communist dictatorship, just like the Soviet Union! He does not deserve credit in the high seas kidnaping of the US Captain! Just because he's the so called POTUS, dont mean didley! \"Even though it is well documented that he gave the skipper of the Bainbridge the discretion to use hostile force when appropriate against the hijackers dont mean squat!\" The chain of command dont mean squat! All praise goes only to the Navy skipper and to the Seals! They are the only ones to be commended! Everyone else be damned! You see, I know about these things, I'm a Pub! And besides, as a Born Again Repub-Neocon, I'm always right! BTW, anyone who supports nobama is either a nazi or a marxist-leninist sympathizer. That includes anyone on this site who is not a repub-conservative; they are disgusting limp wristed parasite libturds-dimlibs who bring shame and dishonor to a site devoted to the proud (conservative) US military!

Those who have served in the military should know better. This could not have been stated better. The problem is that Republicans have screwed up so badly during their years in power that all they can do now is hope for some great screwup or failure on the part of President Obama so they can use it to win the next election.

Now all the sour puss Republicans and Obama bashers here on this site can do is try to find fault in how the mission was conducted. Don't forget that former President Bush had the public's support when he went into Iraq. He certainly had my support. It was good that he took out Saddam and his genocidal hacks. But Bush cowboyed the attack. He did not send in enough troops, failed to have an after victory plan for stabilization and failed to find weapons of mass destruction he claimed Saddam had in his possession. And he also acted like an arrogant with statements such as, \"Bring it on.\" Then, he tried to cover up his bungling by calling his correction a surge. President Obama's handling of this pirate situation was the moment of failure the Limbaugh hacks and Obama bashers were hoping to get so they could verify what they were claiming about President Obama's lack of experience. The ditto heads did not get that and so now they are sore and whining. And there are plenty of whiners and sour grapes losers here on this site who continue to look for ways to bash the President and will never give him credit for successes because they are sore losers and will continue to whine no matter how successful President Obama is with his policies. The policy he executed in the pirate situation was successful and the Republicans and their Limbaugh hacks just hate that.",

Those who have served in the military should know better. This could not have been stated better. The problem is that Republicans have screwed up so badly during their years in power that all they can do now is hope for some great screwup or failure on the part of President Obama so they can use it to win the next election. The Somalia pirate situation was the moment of failure they thought they would get but instead, President Obama proved his abilities and had a successful mission. Now all the sour puss Republicans and Obama bashers here on this site can do is try to find fault in how the mission was conducted. Don't forget that former President Bush had the public's support when he went into Iraq. He certainly had my support. It was good that he took out Saddam and his genocidal hacks. But Bush cowboyed the attack. He did not send in enough troops, failed to have an after victory plan for stabilization and failed to find weapons of mass destruction he claimed Saddam had in his possession. And he also acted like an arrogant with statements such as, \"Bring it on.\" Then, he tried to cover up his bungling by calling his correction a surge. President Obama's handling of this pirate situation was the moment of failure the Limbaugh hacks and Obama bashers were hoping to get so they could verify what they were claiming about President Obama's lack of experience. The ditto heads did not get that and so now they are sore and whining. And there are plenty of whiners and sour grapes losers here on this site who continue to look for ways to bash the President and will never give him credit for successes because they are sore losers and will continue to whine no matter how successful President Obama is with his policies. The policy he executed in the pirate situation was successful and the Republicans and their Limbaugh hacks just hate that.",
