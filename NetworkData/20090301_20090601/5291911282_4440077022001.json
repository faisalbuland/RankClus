Feel free to contact the El Paso Independent School District yourself to voice your concern with this decision. EPISD Administration, As a Disabled American Veteran, I can not, for the life of me, understand how you can tell a student that he can't wear his service uniform to accept his diploma. I almost want to contact my own lawyer and pay for the fight on behalf of the young men and women who choose to fight for the freedom of their classmates, their teachers and the people that made this ridiculous decision. I would really like to sit down and speak with someone about this. \"It was decided for the student not to walk in his, their uniform, because of uniformity,\u201d said EPISD spokes woman Berenice Zubia. \u201cWe want all of our students to wear their cap and gown.\u201d (KFOX Website) This says that the school \"wants\" them to wear them. It does not sound very mandatory. Also, what about the students that have a hard time affording the cap and gown? What is done about that? To tell you the truth, it seems a lot like the administration of the district is just trying to show that they have the power. I can completely understand using that power when dealing with senior pranks, graduation day conduct, and other disciplinary issues, but you are really rubbing a nerve with a lot of citizens. Does this school require uniforms each day? Is there a JROTC unit at this school and are they required to wear uniforms on certain days? Tell me this; What is more respectful than a soldiers uniform? This young man, and the others who were denied this right, could very well die or be seriously injured fighting for their country and the school district has the audacity to deny them this basic request that most people would respect and be proud to see. This seems like the type of story that could attract a lot of attention. I would expect someone in the EPISD administration would like to talk to me by COB tomorrow. Please have them call me at *********** at their convenience. Scott This message has been edited. Last edited by: mainedawg, Tue 14 April 2009 11:37 PM",
