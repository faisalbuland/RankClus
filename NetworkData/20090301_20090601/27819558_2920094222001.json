        "content": "Iowa Guard will still oust married gays Gay and lesbian military service members who are legally married in Iowa can still be involuntarily discharged from the Iowa National Guard and other military branches under a federal law that prevents homosexuals from openly serving in the armed forces, military officials say. The federal law, approved by Congress in 1993, takes precedence over the Iowa Supreme Court ruling in April that legalized same-sex marriage, according to legal experts. The ruling struck down Iowa's Defense of Marriage Act, which had limited marriage to a man and a woman. The Iowa National Guard is prevented from implementing the Iowa Supreme Court's ruling for its personnel because it is a federally recognized military organization, said Lt. Col. Gregory Hapgood Jr., the Iowa National Guard's public affairs officer. \"We are a microcosm of society,\" Hapgood said. \"We have gay people in the Iowa National Guard. But under that policy, that is not the test. It is about conduct, not about whether you are gay.\" The federal law is often described as \"don't ask, don't tell\" because it permits gays and lesbians to serve in the military if they are not open about their sexual orientation. Officials representing One Iowa, a Des Moines-based gay rights group, said they had been unaware of the Iowa National Guard's legal stance on same-sex marriage. We believe that gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the military and encourage federal legislation to repeal 'don't ask, don't tell.' Iowans serving honorably in the military should not have to choose between the protections of marriage and their dedication to serving our country,\" said Carolyn Jenison, One Iowa's executive director. None of the 9,400 soldiers and airmen now serving in the Iowa National Guard is known to have obtained a license for a same-sex marriage since the Iowa court ruling was issued, Hapgood said.

DADT and Gay Marriage issues are going to become more and more interesting in the coming months.",
