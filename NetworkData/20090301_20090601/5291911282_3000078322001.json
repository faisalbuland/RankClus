        "content": "I am a mother and a wife of Air force men. My youngest son has been trying to get in the AF. He went to MEPS and passed everything except the eye exam to be an SP this is something he really really wants to be. He said that the person doing the exam told him to choose which was clearer but he said she never changed it to show him anything so he sat there thinking she was going to change it and he said all of a sudden she said he was done. They said he didnt qualify to be a cop because of his eyes. The recruiter has done nothing to help my son. He doesnt even call my son back. We did this trick and my son called and left a message with the recruiter and then i called and left a messasge that i was interested in joining the AF and in 5 min i got a call back from the recruiter but my son did not get any call back. So what choice is there for my son? He really wants to follow the family steps in the AF but he really wants to be a cop too. Is there someone he can talk to or letters to write. Please guide us what we can do. PLEASE HELP Thank you",
