One day, the Taliban took over the O.P. using small arms fire and a few grenades. There were no casualties. They all just simply ran away. After they diteched their uniforms and weapons. So, fast forward a few days later when an American team goes up to check on the O.P., and sure enough, they are ambushed and several are killed. It took us a while to figure out what happened. Most of the guys that were manning the O.P. where just chilling at their homes when we found them after the incident. I could go on...........................",

And other than teaching the Afghans to use computer directed communications systems or armaments, there probably isn't an awful lot a 25-year old Marine from upstate New York could teach Afghans about fighting Afghans. They've been doing that, at least in the latest 'go round', since 'junior' was in nappies. They seem to have some facility - call it trial and error - in becoming pretty proficient with fairly high technology all by themselves.
