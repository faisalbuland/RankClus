In fact, I have long been on record as having testified and also in helping write doctrine for interrogation techniques that are completely in line with the Geneva Convention. And as a division commander in Iraq in the early days, we put out guidance very early on to make sure that our soldiers, in fact, knew that we needed to stay within those guidelines. With respect to Guantanamo, I think that the closure in a responsible manner, obviously one that is certainly being worked out now by the Department of Justice - I talked to the Attorney General the other day and they have a very intensive effort ongoing to determine, indeed, what to do with the detainees who are left, how to deal with them in a legal way, and if continued incarceration is necessary - again, how to take that forward. But doing that in a responsible manner, I think, sends an important message to the world, as does the commitment of the United States to observe the Geneva Convention when it comes to the treatment of detainees. General Petraeus wants Gitmo to be closed and wants American interrogators to stop using \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (such as waterboarding). He wants suspected terrorists to be treated under the guidelines of the Geneva Conventions. How soon before Rush Limpbum says something like: quote: General Petraeus has been infected with Socialism and is now lost to us. Supporters of Sarah Palin, as recently as May 15, 2009, were speculating on the strength of a Palin-Petraeus ticket for the 2012 Presidential election. \"http://www.thesarahpalinblog.com/2009/05/sarah-palin-supporters-want-david.html\" Spencer Ackerman in the American Prospect, January 22, 2008 was suggesting the the GOP make Petraeus their Presidential candidate in 2012 \"http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=petraeus_12\" I guess that's all over now. General Petraeus is against waterboarding, he's for giving suspected terrorists protections under the Geneva Conventions and he's for closing Gitmo - all things that, according to Rush \"I can't serve my country - I have a pimple on my butt\" Limpbum means that General Petraeus is a commie/socialist/Democrat.",

In fact, I have long been on record as having testified and also in helping write doctrine for interrogation techniques that are completely in line with the Geneva Convention. And as a division commander in Iraq in the early days, we put out guidance very early on to make sure that our soldiers, in fact, knew that we needed to stay within those guidelines. With respect to Guantanamo, I think that the closure in a responsible manner, obviously one that is certainly being worked out now by the Department of Justice - I talked to the Attorney General the other day and they have a very intensive effort ongoing to determine, indeed, what to do with the detainees who are left, how to deal with them in a legal way, and if continued incarceration is necessary - again, how to take that forward. But doing that in a responsible manner, I think, sends an important message to the world, as does the commitment of the United States to observe the Geneva Convention when it comes to the treatment of detainees.", 
        "reply": "General Petraeus, during an interview on Radio Free Europe:  General Petraeus wants Gitmo to be closed and wants American interrogators to stop using \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (such as waterboarding). He wants suspected terrorists to be treated under the guidelines of the Geneva Conventions. How soon before Rush Limpbum says something like: quote: General Petraeus has been infected with Socialism and is now lost to us. Supporters of Sarah Palin, as recently as May 15, 2009, were speculating on the strength of a Palin-Petraeus ticket for the 2012 Presidential election. \"http://www.thesarahpalinblog.com/2009/05/sarah-palin-supporters-want-david.html\" Spencer Ackerman in the American Prospect, January 22, 2008 was suggesting the the GOP make Petraeus their Presidential candidate in 2012 \"http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=petraeus_12\" I guess that's all over now. General Petraeus is against waterboarding, he's for giving suspected terrorists protections under the Geneva Conventions and he's for closing Gitmo - all things that, according to Rush \"I can't serve my country - I have a pimple on my butt\" Limpbum means that General Petraeus is a commie/socialist/Democrat.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by Fightdirector: General Petraeus, during an interview on Radio Free Europe: quote: I think, on balance, that those moves to end enhanced interrogation techniques help us. In fact, I have long been on record as having testified and also in helping write doctrine for interrogation techniques that are completely in line with the Geneva Convention. And as a division commander in Iraq in the early days, we put out guidance very early on to make sure that our soldiers, in fact, knew that we needed to stay within those guidelines. With respect to Guantanamo, I think that the closure in a responsible manner, obviously one that is certainly being worked out now by the Department of Justice - I talked to the Attorney General the other day and they have a very intensive effort ongoing to determine, indeed, what to do with the detainees who are left, how to deal with them in a legal way, and if continued incarceration is necessary - again, how to take that forward. But doing that in a responsible manner, I think, sends an important message to the world, as does the commitment of the United States to observe the Geneva Convention when it comes to the treatment of detainees. General Petraeus wants Gitmo to be closed and wants American interrogators to stop using \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (such as waterboarding). He wants suspected terrorists to be treated under the guidelines of the Geneva Conventions.
