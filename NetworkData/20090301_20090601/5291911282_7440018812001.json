What you need to look at is \"What are the French doing anywhere now??\" You'll be sitting on your butt in Garrison going through hell for - nothing. The Foreign Legion ain't doing anything worth doing anywhere that I know of - - If you want to test you guts and metal, then join into something that will put you in the heat, not the closet. American soldiers and sailors have their feet to the fire all over the world - - or maybe that is what you're running from, not to... Of course, you might be called on to do riot control in the streets of Paris this next summer if France doesn't kiss up to the Muslims enough, but they probably will - - About all I can see of the French is that they play soldier since cutting out of NATO. If you want to REALLY BE a soldier and BE on the cutting edge. Become a Marine, or a Special Forces, or a Navy Seal, and you might actually accomplish something - -", 
        "reply": " I have actually done my research on the French Foreign Legion, and they are currently deployed in Chad, Afghanistan, Djibouti among other places) You will also be glad to know that France is officially back within NATO's command structure (and considering how bad that Alliance yanked their chain in the past, I do not blame them for leaving). Lastly, to my line of thinking, being based in Europe is a hell of a lot better than being based somewhere in the Midwest or in California. Lastly, I sort of game here for US force information as I am well read in regards to the Legion. Special Forces may be an option though I would really like to add another language.",

I suppose I might draw some punishment from the Mods but I'll rot in hell before I muzzle my self from speaking the truth as I know it. Your decision to join the French Foreign Legion is a slap in the face to your country. You offer up your loyalty, indeed your life for France instead of your own country? Your first, best loyalty is to your country that has provided you with all the benefits you've enjoyed. Did France nurture you? Is France educating you? Will France with their crappy unstable government and rotten bureaucracy see to the needs of you and your family? Take my advise, give your heart, body and life to America. Why the he!! do you think so many people are trying to enter America any way they can? Please tell me how many people are trying to sneak into France? France is the puss filled boil on the butt of Europe. Smarten up and place your loyalties where they belong. You sound like my father . I do not take offense at your opinion. This country is great but it needs to change. Acquiring this education has set me back 110,000$. In France, it is free. Big difference. I guess I want adventure, I need to check out more of what the US has to offer. So that is why I am on this forum.",

I would serve in the Army or the Marines if I didn't have to do Jag. But I don't know about the Officer route, and the entire family would be up in arms if I enlisted as a \"grunt\".

It would be easier for you to \"grunt up\" in one of the US services for three years and then go to France. FFL likes those with experience. The US service (if you find you like military service) will give you much more hassle coming BACK from the Legion. I've heard it has been done, but it's a hassle. But if you're worried about the 'rents so much you'd seek advice here, maybe you need to keep re-evaluating your motivation. I talked to a former American Legionnaire would returned to this country and became an officer in the Army. He said that they gave him a little hastle but he was a good soldier. Soldiering in the Legion is different than that in any American unit. I have been attracted to join since I was 8, it is my longest running \"passion\". If I would do US forces I would really like to join some sort of \"special forces\". I am not some numbnuts who wants to be rambo, or wants to look like a bad a**. I want to do something extremely challenging, while being part of a team, and to do so quietly and with Honor. So are you fluent in French? What is your native language? \"They love our milk and honey but they preach about some other way of living When you\u2019re running down my country, Hoss you\u2019re walking on the fighting side of me\" - - Merle Haggard",

Life is tough You must be very bright to have finished 4 years of undergraduate and 3 years of law school by age 22. Why no interest in law? I suppose I have an interest BUT I want to do this now when I am young, so I will have no regrets when I am 40. I will still be under 30 when my French Foreign Legion contract would expire (unsure of any Marine contract) and the average age entering my law school is 26.8.... So I will STILL be ahead of schedule. I want to go crusading I suppose you could say. I love the USA though but the Legion has been a dream for a long time. I don't consider myself a traitor. I would serve in the Army or the Marines if I didn't have to do Jag. But I don't know about the Officer route, and the entire family would be up in arms if I enlisted as a \"grunt\".

If this is a major concern you might not be ready for any kind of military service. The desire to enlist in the FFL does not make you a traitor. It doesn't make you patriotic either. Obviously this course of action is \"about you\", not much of anything greater unless you are truly concerned for France's security. I find that unlikely. It would be easier for you to \"grunt up\" in one of the US services for three years and then go to France. FFL likes those with experience. The US service (if you find you like military service) will give you much more hassle coming BACK from the Legion. I've heard it has been done, but it's a hassle. But if you're worried about the 'rents so much you'd seek advice here, maybe you need to keep re-evaluating your motivation. I talked to a former American Legionnaire would returned to this country and became an officer in the Army. He said that they gave him a little hastle but he was a good soldier. Soldiering in the Legion is different than that in any American unit. I have been attracted to join since I was 8, it is my longest running \"passion\". If I would do US forces I would really like to join some sort of \"special forces\". I am not some numbnuts who wants to be rambo, or wants to look like a bad a**. I want to do something extremely challenging, while being part of a team, and to do so quietly and with Honor. So are you fluent in French? What is your native language?", 
        "reply": " I am only fluent in English. However I have been studying French for half a year now and I am able to understand simple words and phrases (thank God for Rosetta stone).

They hold us in total disdain and contempt, and although we have pulled their fat out of the fire countless times, they refuse to help us when asked. I have always felt that the only way to properly punish Nazi Germany for their many war crimes of WWII would have been to have made them keep France. I'm going to speak bluntly. I suppose I might draw some punishment from the Mods but I'll rot in hell before I muzzle my self from speaking the truth as I know it. Your decision to join the French Foreign Legion is a slap in the face to your country. You offer up your loyalty, indeed your life for France instead of your own country? Your first, best loyalty is to your country that has provided you with all the benefits you've enjoyed. Did France nurture you? Is France educating you? Will France with their crappy unstable government and rotten bureaucracy see to the needs of you and your family? Take my advise, give your heart, body and life to America.

I suppose I have an interest BUT I want to do this now when I am young, so I will have no regrets when I am 40. I will still be under 30 when my French Foreign Legion contract would expire (unsure of any Marine contract) and the average age entering my law school is 26.8....
