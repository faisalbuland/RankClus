For s-o-o long, I have looked at many items to convert into a nice living space. Since I live near a large navigatable river, I have lately considered converting a freight barge. These things have a HUGE base square footage to work with and a 2-story would definitely be do-able. However, for a land-based starter, train cars are great. While living in Kansas the past 18 years prior to moving here, I have seen an old wooden rail car sitting at the edge of a wheat field, and a couple of steel cabooses on other properties, as well as a few metal freight cars used as work areas for small businesses. I have considered large silos, (round rooms would be cool, but how do you put a child or grandchild in the corner for a time out?), barns, top floors of old brick buildings. In Hutchinson, Kansas; they have sold a couple of the old narrow firehouses (2-story) for residential properties and they would be cool. For legalities, they removed the brass pole for quick access from 2d floor to main floor...but person could put in a circular staircase or re-install a pole. :0) I'm curious about all types of \"recycling\u201d for living space...just 5 years until I will be forced to make a decision about something, somewhere. Whattayasay?? Anyone care to give alternate ideas to the traditional \"house\" building theme?? These are my opinions. Yours may differ.",

For s-o-o long, I have looked at many items to convert into a nice living space. Since I live near a large navigatable river, I have lately considered converting a freight barge. These things have a HUGE base square footage to work with and a 2-story would definitely be do-able. However, for a land-based starter, train cars are great. While living in Kansas the past 18 years prior to moving here, I have seen an old wooden rail car sitting at the edge of a wheat field, and a couple of steel cabooses on other properties, as well as a few metal freight cars used as work areas for small businesses. I have considered large silos, (round rooms would be cool, but how do you put a child or grandchild in the corner for a time out?), barns, top floors of old brick buildings. In Hutchinson, Kansas; they have sold a couple of the old narrow firehouses (2-story) for residential properties and they would be cool. For legalities, they removed the brass pole for quick access from 2d floor to main floor...but person could put in a circular staircase or re-install a pole. :0) I'm curious about all types of \"recycling\u201d for living space...just 5 years until I will be forced to make a decision about something, somewhere. Whattayasay?? Anyone care to give alternate ideas to the traditional \"house\" building theme?? These are my opinions. Yours may differ.",
