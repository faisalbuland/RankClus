Further Accounts of Gaza Killings Released JERUSALEM \u2014 In the two months since Israel ended its military assault on Gaza, Palestinians and international rights groups have accused it of excessive force and wanton killing in that operation, but the Israeli military has said it followed high ethical standards and took great care to avoid civilian casualties. Now testimony is emerging from within the ranks of soldiers and officers alleging a permissive attitude toward the killing of civilians and reckless destruction of property that is sure to inflame the domestic and international debate about the army\u2019s conduct in Gaza. On Thursday, the military\u2019s chief advocate general ordered an investigation into a soldier\u2019s account of a sniper killing a woman and her two children who walked too close to a designated no-go area by mistake, and another account of a sharpshooter who killed an elderly woman who came within 100 yards of a commandeered house. When asked why that elderly woman was killed, a squad commander was quoted as saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s great about Gaza \u2014 you see a person on a path, he doesn\u2019t have to be armed, you can simply shoot him. In our case it was an old woman on whom I did not see any weapon when I looked. The order was to take down the person, this woman, the minute you see her. There are always warnings, there is always the saying, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s a terrorist.\u2019 What I felt was, there was a lot of thirst for blood.\u201d The testimonies by soldiers, leaked to the newspapers Maariv and Haaretz, appeared in a journal published by a military preparatory course at the Oranim Academic College in the northern town of Tivon. The academy\u2019s director, Dany Zamir, told Israel Radio, \u201cThose were very harsh testimonies about unjustified shooting of civilians and destruction of property that conveyed an atmosphere in which one feels entitled to use unrestricted force against Palestinians.\u201d The revelations caused an immediate uproar here, with some soldiers and reservists saying they did not recognize the stories being told as accurate. On Friday, Haaretz published much more extensive, although not complete, excerpts from the soldiers\u2019 testimonies. It said the names of the soldiers had been changed and that some details regarding the units involved had been left out. The lengthier accounts showed something of a religious and cultural divide between the witnesses who spoke and the soldiers whose actions they were describing and criticizing. One complained that the soldiers were being fed religious propaganda by the army\u2019s rabbi and that they thought they were waging a holy war. \"The whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war,\" a soldier who was called Ram was quoted as saying. None of the soldiers who described abuses acknowledging having taken part in them. Rather, they spoke of the actions of others with strong disapproval. It was evident that Mr. Zamir objected to the religious nature of some of the discussions and also felt that his concerns, which he had raised earlier in a letter to the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, had not been taken seriously and that was why he published the testimonies. Since the war ended, others have raised similar questions, generating a heated debate within military circles. \u201cAccording to the code, a soldier has to do his utmost to avoid civilian casualties and that involves taking some risk,\u201d said Moshe Halbertal, a Jewish philosophy professor at Hebrew University who, along with three others, rewrote the military ethics code eight years ago. \u201cThat is the question we have to struggle with. From the testimonies of these soldiers, it sounds like they didn\u2019t practice this norm.\u201d Amir Marmor, a 33-year-old history graduate student in Jerusalem and a military reservist, said in an interview with The New York Times that he was stunned to discover the way civilian casualties were discussed in training discussions before his tank unit entered Gaza in January. An Israeli newspaper gave a fuller account on Friday of soldiers\u2019 testimonies alleging loose rules of engagement in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which led to civilian deaths and wanton property destruction. One soldier asserted that extremist rabbis had told troops they were fighting a holy war. The soldier, given the pseudonym Ram in the newspaper article, said the rabbis had \u201cbrought in a lot of booklets and articles, and their message was very clear: We are the Jewish people, we came to this land by a miracle, God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land.\u201d He added that as a commander, he had tried to explain to his men that \u201cnot everyone who is in Gaza is Hamas,\u201d and that \u201cthis war was not a war for the sanctification of the holy name, but rather one to stop the Qassam rockets.\u201d The account, in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, expanded on shorter excerpts printed Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv, a center-right newspaper, and came from a taped conversation among Gaza war veterans at an institute that prepares soldiers before their service. After the materials were published, the military advocate general began an investigation into the allegations. The director of the institute where the discussion occurred, Dany Zamir, published the accounts in his newsletter and leaked them to the newspapers to draw attention to what he considered to be troubling revelations. Mr. Zamir is known to be on the left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum. He is quoted in the excerpts as saying to the soldiers who spoke: \u201cI think it would be important for parents to sit here and hear this discussion. I think it would be an instructive discussion, and also very dismaying and depressing. You are describing an army with very low norms of value, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Earlier excerpts included an account of the killing of an elderly woman by a sharpshooter and the killing of a woman and two children by another sniper. The testimonies published Friday also spoke of the ease with which some houses were damaged. Another soldier said, \u201cWe got an order one day \u2014 all of the equipment, all of the furniture, just clean out the whole house. We threw everything , everything out of the windows to make room. The entire contents of the house went flying out the windows.\u201d The soldier also alleged that when entering buildings, \u201cwe were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified, we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself, where is the logic in this? \u201cFrom above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect incriminated, a terrorist, because they hadn\u2019t fled. I didn\u2019t really understand. On one hand they don\u2019t really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they\u2019re telling us they hadn\u2019t fled so it\u2019s their fault.\u201d America SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS!!! No wonder we are in a War on Terrorism, considering we are supporting the MURDER of thousands of civilians. THIS HAS TO STOP.",

Since the war ended, others have raised similar questions, generating a heated debate within military circles. \u201cAccording to the code, a soldier has to do his utmost to avoid civilian casualties and that involves taking some risk,\u201d said Moshe Halbertal, a Jewish philosophy professor at Hebrew University who, along with three others, rewrote the military ethics code eight years ago. \u201cThat is the question we have to struggle with. From the testimonies of these soldiers, it sounds like they didn\u2019t practice this norm.\u201d Amir Marmor, a 33-year-old history graduate student in Jerusalem and a military reservist, said in an interview with The New York Times that he was stunned to discover the way civilian casualties were discussed in training discussions before his tank unit entered Gaza in January. An Israeli newspaper gave a fuller account on Friday of soldiers\u2019 testimonies alleging loose rules of engagement in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which led to civilian deaths and wanton property destruction. One soldier asserted that extremist rabbis had told troops they were fighting a holy war. The soldier, given the pseudonym Ram in the newspaper article, said the rabbis had \u201cbrought in a lot of booklets and articles, and their message was very clear: We are the Jewish people, we came to this land by a miracle, God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land.\u201d He added that as a commander, he had tried to explain to his men that \u201cnot everyone who is in Gaza is Hamas,\u201d and that \u201cthis war was not a war for the sanctification of the holy name, but rather one to stop the Qassam rockets.\u201d The account, in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, expanded on shorter excerpts printed Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv, a center-right newspaper, and came from a taped conversation among Gaza war veterans at an institute that prepares soldiers before their service. After the materials were published, the military advocate general began an investigation into the allegations. The director of the institute where the discussion occurred, Dany Zamir, published the accounts in his newsletter and leaked them to the newspapers to draw attention to what he considered to be troubling revelations. Mr. Zamir is known to be on the left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum. He is quoted in the excerpts as saying to the soldiers who spoke: \u201cI think it would be important for parents to sit here and hear this discussion. I think it would be an instructive discussion, and also very dismaying and depressing. You are describing an army with very low norms of value, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Earlier excerpts included an account of the killing of an elderly woman by a sharpshooter and the killing of a woman and two children by another sniper. The testimonies published Friday also spoke of the ease with which some houses were damaged. Another soldier said, \u201cWe got an order one day \u2014 all of the equipment, all of the furniture, just clean out the whole house. We threw everything , everything out of the windows to make room. The entire contents of the house went flying out the windows.\u201d The soldier also alleged that when entering buildings, \u201cwe were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified, we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself, where is the logic in this? \u201cFrom above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect incriminated, a terrorist, because they hadn\u2019t fled. I didn\u2019t really understand. On one hand they don\u2019t really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they\u2019re telling us they hadn\u2019t fled so it\u2019s their fault.\u201d America SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS!!! No wonder we are in a War on Terrorism, considering we are supporting the MURDER of thousands of civilians. THIS HAS TO STOP.",

        "content": "While America looks the other way, the United Nations condemns the Israelis acts in Gaza: U.N. report condemns Israel for Gaza operation (CNN) -- Israeli soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm's way during their 22-day offensive against the Palestinians in Gaza, according to a United Nations report made public Monday. The report said a working group had documented and verified reports of violations \"too numerous to list.\" For example, on January 15, in a town southwest of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces soldiers ordered an 11-year-old boy to open Palestinians' packages, presumably so that the soldiers would not be hurt if they turned out to contain explosives, the 43-page report said. They then forced the boy to walk in front of them in the town, it said. When the soldiers came under fire, \"the boy remained in front of the group,\" the report said. It said the boy was later released. The report cited two alleged incidents from January 3. In one, it said, after a tank round struck near a house, a father and his two sons -- both younger than 11 -- emerged to look at the damage. \"As they exited their home, IDF soldiers shot and killed them (at the entrance to their house), with the daughter witnessing,\" the report said. In the second, it said, \"Israeli soldiers entered a family house in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City. Standing at the doorstep, they asked the male head of the household to come out and shot him dead, without warning, while he was holding his ID, hands raised up in the air, and then started to fire indiscriminately and without warning into the room where the rest of the family was huddled together. \"The eldest son was shouting in vain the word 'Children' in Hebrew to warn the soldiers. The shooting did not stop until everyone was lying on the floor. The mother and four of the brothers, aged 2-12 years, had been wounded, one of them, aged 4, fatally.\" The alleged instances occurred during Operation Cast Lead, which was launched December 27 to halt rocket attacks into southern Israel from Gaza and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. The U.N. report called the response by Israel disproportionate. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, the report said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said. The report said the Israeli operation resulted in \"a dramatic deterioration of the living conditions of the civilian population.\" It cited \"targeted and indiscriminate\" attacks on hospitals and clinics, water and sewage treatment facilities, government buildings, utilities and farming and said the offensive \"intensified the already catastrophic humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people.\" It said Israeli strikes damaged more than 200 schools and left more than 70,000 people homeless. \"There are strong and credible reports of war crimes and other violations of international norms,\" it said, adding that many observers have said war crimes investigations should be undertaken. \"The alternative is de facto impunity,\" it said. It called for the end of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the free passage into the territory of food, medicine, fuel and construction supplies. Another report issued Monday also was critical of the IDF. The report from Physicians for Human Rights said the Gaza incursion violated IDF's own code of ethics. The report by the medical group, which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, cited instances where it said IDF forces did not evacuate injured civilians for days and prevented Palestinian teams from reaching the wounded, and said some of them died as a result. It said 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by IDF fire and 25 were wounded during the IDF operation, and accused the IDF of attacking 34 medical centers in violation of the IDF's own \"ethical code for fighting terror.\" Nevertheless, it said, an IDF investigation is ongoing and its conclusions will be made public once it is complete. But Dr. Dani Filc, PHR-Israel chairman, was skeptical that the investigation would prove useful. \"There are considerable doubts that the IDF is the correct institution to investigate suspicions of these violations,\" he said. \"The IDF's repeated promises to the High Court to look into attacks on medical teams and medical centers have gone unfulfilled, and there are suspicions concerning its seriousness and readiness to carry out the matter.\" The Israeli military did accept criticism Monday on another matter -- the practice of some Israeli soldiers of wearing T-shirts that appear to condone acts of violence against Palestinians. The Israeli daily Haaretz newspaper reported that Israeli soldiers who had finished basic training ordered the shirts, one of which showed a pregnant Arab in the crosshairs of a gun sight with a caption reading \"1 Shot 2 Kills.\" Another showing a small child in a gun's sight was captioned, \"The smaller they are, the harder it is.\" \"The examples presented by The Haaretz reporter are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless,\" the Israeli military said in a written statement. \"This type of humor is unbecoming and should be condemned.\" Israeli soldiers said last week that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Haaretz.

Dang does this sound like your gripe. D.J. So Donnie, how proud are you of that legacy? Not very I would hope. So, because America did that in the 1800s should we support Israel doing that TODAY? Haven't we learned from the abuses of the past? And aren't the Jews always preaching about how the world can never let what happened to them at the hands of Hitler happen again? Then how can we let them do this to people? Is it OK for this to happen as long as it isn't happening TO the Jews? As long as the Jews are doing it to someone else, we're ok with that? Which is it? Never again, or it is OK as long as the Jews do it to others? Which is it - you can't have it both ways! I am saying that according to American Principles, and all that is right, people are not supposed to be abusing other people. Systematic extermination is frowned upon by our society; or don't YOU agree Donnie? It is a very simple question Donnie. Right or wrong? Call me crazy but I think America is supposed to support Justice, Freedom, Equality, right vs. wrong, you know the kind of society that makes you PAY for your house, as opposed to killing the inhabitants and moving in. So, Donnie, which way of living do YOU support? Should we be attacking Canada for THEIR land Donnie? Or not. Very simple question, sir. Now apply that to the MURDERERS who have made 4 million refugees and are continuing to KILL the civilians who have been fighting their own extermination. You know who they are, but they want YOUR support Donnie. They are BUYING the US governments' support, and ALL OF US are paying for that CRIME. Do you like that Donnie? Do you LIKE your country being USED for crimes against humanity Donnie? I don't. I want America to remember the difference from right and wrong, and you do too Donnie. Straighten up and fly right.",

This is from the LEADER of the TERRORISTS: CAIRO, Egypt\u2014Osama bin Laden said in a new audio recording released Friday that al-Qaida will continue its holy war against Israel and its allies until it liberates Palestine. The terrorist leader's third statement this year came as President Bush was wrapping up his visit to Israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Jewish state. Bin Laden said the fight for the Palestinian cause was the most important factor driving al-Qaida's war with the West and fueled 19 Muslims to carry out the suicide attacks against the U.S. on September 11. \"To Western nations ... this speech is to understand the core reason of the war between our civilization and your civilizations. I mean the Palestinian cause,\" said bin Laden in the close to 10 minute audiotape. \"The Palestinian cause is the major issue for my (Islamic) nation. It was an important element in fueling me from the beginning and the 19 others with a great motive to fight for those subjected to injustice and the oppressed,\" added bin Laden. The al-Qaida leader said the Western media managed to brainwash people over the past 60 years by \"portraying the Jewish invaders, the occupiers of our land, as the victims while it portrayed us as the terrorists.\" \"Sixty years ago, the Israeli state didn't exist. Instead, it was established on the land of Palestine raped by force,\" said bin Laden. \"Israelis are occupying invaders whom we should fight.\" You can't disreguard this when the \"enemy\" tells you VERY CLEARLY exactly why they are fighting. And it DOES make a lot of sense for people being oppressed, bulldozed, evicted, made into refugees, blockaded, occupied, abused, and murdered to fight back. Granted we did this to the American Indians, and are not being attacked today; but does that make it right for the Israelis to do this today? NO, IT DOES NOT. America must stop supporting the abuse and murder of civilians, and Israel must stop the injustices if there is ever going to be peace in the Middle East.

        "content": "When I read these accounts from their OWN soldiers, while the victims have been claiming these type of abuses for DECADES, I have to wonder how AMERICA can still support Israel?? Further Accounts of Gaza Killings Released JERUSALEM \u2014 In the two months since Israel ended its military assault on Gaza, Palestinians and international rights groups have accused it of excessive force and wanton killing in that operation, but the Israeli military has said it followed high ethical standards and took great care to avoid civilian casualties. Now testimony is emerging from within the ranks of soldiers and officers alleging a permissive attitude toward the killing of civilians and reckless destruction of property that is sure to inflame the domestic and international debate about the army\u2019s conduct in Gaza. On Thursday, the military\u2019s chief advocate general ordered an investigation into a soldier\u2019s account of a sniper killing a woman and her two children who walked too close to a designated no-go area by mistake, and another account of a sharpshooter who killed an elderly woman who came within 100 yards of a commandeered house. When asked why that elderly woman was killed, a squad commander was quoted as saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s great about Gaza \u2014 you see a person on a path, he doesn\u2019t have to be armed, you can simply shoot him. In our case it was an old woman on whom I did not see any weapon when I looked. The order was to take down the person, this woman, the minute you see her. There are always warnings, there is always the saying, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s a terrorist.\u2019 What I felt was, there was a lot of thirst for blood.\u201d The testimonies by soldiers, leaked to the newspapers Maariv and Haaretz, appeared in a journal published by a military preparatory course at the Oranim Academic College in the northern town of Tivon. The academy\u2019s director, Dany Zamir, told Israel Radio, \u201cThose were very harsh testimonies about unjustified shooting of civilians and destruction of property that conveyed an atmosphere in which one feels entitled to use unrestricted force against Palestinians.\u201d The revelations caused an immediate uproar here, with some soldiers and reservists saying they did not recognize the stories being told as accurate. On Friday, Haaretz published much more extensive, although not complete, excerpts from the soldiers\u2019 testimonies. It said the names of the soldiers had been changed and that some details regarding the units involved had been left out. The lengthier accounts showed something of a religious and cultural divide between the witnesses who spoke and the soldiers whose actions they were describing and criticizing. One complained that the soldiers were being fed religious propaganda by the army\u2019s rabbi and that they thought they were waging a holy war. \"The whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war,\" a soldier who was called Ram was quoted as saying. None of the soldiers who described abuses acknowledging having taken part in them. Rather, they spoke of the actions of others with strong disapproval. It was evident that Mr. Zamir objected to the religious nature of some of the discussions and also felt that his concerns, which he had raised earlier in a letter to the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, had not been taken seriously and that was why he published the testimonies. Since the war ended, others have raised similar questions, generating a heated debate within military circles. \u201cAccording to the code, a soldier has to do his utmost to avoid civilian casualties and that involves taking some risk,\u201d said Moshe Halbertal, a Jewish philosophy professor at Hebrew University who, along with three others, rewrote the military ethics code eight years ago. \u201cThat is the question we have to struggle with. From the testimonies of these soldiers, it sounds like they didn\u2019t practice this norm.\u201d Amir Marmor, a 33-year-old history graduate student in Jerusalem and a military reservist, said in an interview with The New York Times that he was stunned to discover the way civilian casualties were discussed in training discussions before his tank unit entered Gaza in January. An Israeli newspaper gave a fuller account on Friday of soldiers\u2019 testimonies alleging loose rules of engagement in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which led to civilian deaths and wanton property destruction. One soldier asserted that extremist rabbis had told troops they were fighting a holy war. The soldier, given the pseudonym Ram in the newspaper article, said the rabbis had \u201cbrought in a lot of booklets and articles, and their message was very clear: We are the Jewish people, we came to this land by a miracle, God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land.\u201d He added that as a commander, he had tried to explain to his men that \u201cnot everyone who is in Gaza is Hamas,\u201d and that \u201cthis war was not a war for the sanctification of the holy name, but rather one to stop the Qassam rockets.\u201d The account, in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, expanded on shorter excerpts printed Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv, a center-right newspaper, and came from a taped conversation among Gaza war veterans at an institute that prepares soldiers before their service. After the materials were published, the military advocate general began an investigation into the allegations. The director of the institute where the discussion occurred, Dany Zamir, published the accounts in his newsletter and leaked them to the newspapers to draw attention to what he considered to be troubling revelations. Mr. Zamir is known to be on the left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum. He is quoted in the excerpts as saying to the soldiers who spoke: \u201cI think it would be important for parents to sit here and hear this discussion. I think it would be an instructive discussion, and also very dismaying and depressing. You are describing an army with very low norms of value, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Earlier excerpts included an account of the killing of an elderly woman by a sharpshooter and the killing of a woman and two children by another sniper. The testimonies published Friday also spoke of the ease with which some houses were damaged. Another soldier said, \u201cWe got an order one day \u2014 all of the equipment, all of the furniture, just clean out the whole house. We threw everything , everything out of the windows to make room. The entire contents of the house went flying out the windows.\u201d The soldier also alleged that when entering buildings, \u201cwe were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified, we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself, where is the logic in this? \u201cFrom above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect incriminated, a terrorist, because they hadn\u2019t fled. I didn\u2019t really understand. On one hand they don\u2019t really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they\u2019re telling us they hadn\u2019t fled so it\u2019s their fault.\u201d America SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS!!!

There are always warnings, there is always the saying, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s a terrorist.\u2019 What I felt was, there was a lot of thirst for blood.\u201d The testimonies by soldiers, leaked to the newspapers Maariv and Haaretz, appeared in a journal published by a military preparatory course at the Oranim Academic College in the northern town of Tivon. The academy\u2019s director, Dany Zamir, told Israel Radio, \u201cThose were very harsh testimonies about unjustified shooting of civilians and destruction of property that conveyed an atmosphere in which one feels entitled to use unrestricted force against Palestinians.\u201d The revelations caused an immediate uproar here, with some soldiers and reservists saying they did not recognize the stories being told as accurate. On Friday, Haaretz published much more extensive, although not complete, excerpts from the soldiers\u2019 testimonies. It said the names of the soldiers had been changed and that some details regarding the units involved had been left out. The lengthier accounts showed something of a religious and cultural divide between the witnesses who spoke and the soldiers whose actions they were describing and criticizing. One complained that the soldiers were being fed religious propaganda by the army\u2019s rabbi and that they thought they were waging a holy war. \"The whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war,\" a soldier who was called Ram was quoted as saying. None of the soldiers who described abuses acknowledging having taken part in them. Rather, they spoke of the actions of others with strong disapproval. It was evident that Mr. Zamir objected to the religious nature of some of the discussions and also felt that his concerns, which he had raised earlier in a letter to the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, had not been taken seriously and that was why he published the testimonies. Since the war ended, others have raised similar questions, generating a heated debate within military circles. \u201cAccording to the code, a soldier has to do his utmost to avoid civilian casualties and that involves taking some risk,\u201d said Moshe Halbertal, a Jewish philosophy professor at Hebrew University who, along with three others, rewrote the military ethics code eight years ago. \u201cThat is the question we have to struggle with. From the testimonies of these soldiers, it sounds like they didn\u2019t practice this norm.\u201d Amir Marmor, a 33-year-old history graduate student in Jerusalem and a military reservist, said in an interview with The New York Times that he was stunned to discover the way civilian casualties were discussed in training discussions before his tank unit entered Gaza in January. An Israeli newspaper gave a fuller account on Friday of soldiers\u2019 testimonies alleging loose rules of engagement in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which led to civilian deaths and wanton property destruction. One soldier asserted that extremist rabbis had told troops they were fighting a holy war. The soldier, given the pseudonym Ram in the newspaper article, said the rabbis had \u201cbrought in a lot of booklets and articles, and their message was very clear: We are the Jewish people, we came to this land by a miracle, God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land.\u201d He added that as a commander, he had tried to explain to his men that \u201cnot everyone who is in Gaza is Hamas,\u201d and that \u201cthis war was not a war for the sanctification of the holy name, but rather one to stop the Qassam rockets.\u201d The account, in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, expanded on shorter excerpts printed Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv, a center-right newspaper, and came from a taped conversation among Gaza war veterans at an institute that prepares soldiers before their service. After the materials were published, the military advocate general began an investigation into the allegations. The director of the institute where the discussion occurred, Dany Zamir, published the accounts in his newsletter and leaked them to the newspapers to draw attention to what he considered to be troubling revelations. Mr. Zamir is known to be on the left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum. He is quoted in the excerpts as saying to the soldiers who spoke: \u201cI think it would be important for parents to sit here and hear this discussion. I think it would be an instructive discussion, and also very dismaying and depressing. You are describing an army with very low norms of value, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Earlier excerpts included an account of the killing of an elderly woman by a sharpshooter and the killing of a woman and two children by another sniper. The testimonies published Friday also spoke of the ease with which some houses were damaged. Another soldier said, \u201cWe got an order one day \u2014 all of the equipment, all of the furniture, just clean out the whole house. We threw everything , everything out of the windows to make room. The entire contents of the house went flying out the windows.\u201d The soldier also alleged that when entering buildings, \u201cwe were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified, we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself, where is the logic in this? \u201cFrom above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect incriminated, a terrorist, because they hadn\u2019t fled. I didn\u2019t really understand. On one hand they don\u2019t really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they\u2019re telling us they hadn\u2019t fled so it\u2019s their fault.\u201d America SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS!!! No wonder we are in a War on Terrorism, considering we are supporting the MURDER of thousands of civilians. THIS HAS TO STOP.",

        "content": "While America looks the other way, the United Nations condemns the Israelis acts in Gaza: U.N. report condemns Israel for Gaza operation (CNN) -- Israeli soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm's way during their 22-day offensive against the Palestinians in Gaza, according to a United Nations report made public Monday. The report said a working group had documented and verified reports of violations \"too numerous to list.\" For example, on January 15, in a town southwest of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces soldiers ordered an 11-year-old boy to open Palestinians' packages, presumably so that the soldiers would not be hurt if they turned out to contain explosives, the 43-page report said. They then forced the boy to walk in front of them in the town, it said. When the soldiers came under fire, \"the boy remained in front of the group,\" the report said. It said the boy was later released. The report cited two alleged incidents from January 3. In one, it said, after a tank round struck near a house, a father and his two sons -- both younger than 11 -- emerged to look at the damage. \"As they exited their home, IDF soldiers shot and killed them (at the entrance to their house), with the daughter witnessing,\" the report said. In the second, it said, \"Israeli soldiers entered a family house in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City. Standing at the doorstep, they asked the male head of the household to come out and shot him dead, without warning, while he was holding his ID, hands raised up in the air, and then started to fire indiscriminately and without warning into the room where the rest of the family was huddled together. \"The eldest son was shouting in vain the word 'Children' in Hebrew to warn the soldiers. The shooting did not stop until everyone was lying on the floor. The mother and four of the brothers, aged 2-12 years, had been wounded, one of them, aged 4, fatally.\" The alleged instances occurred during Operation Cast Lead, which was launched December 27 to halt rocket attacks into southern Israel from Gaza and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. The U.N. report called the response by Israel disproportionate. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, the report said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said. The report said the Israeli operation resulted in \"a dramatic deterioration of the living conditions of the civilian population.\" It cited \"targeted and indiscriminate\" attacks on hospitals and clinics, water and sewage treatment facilities, government buildings, utilities and farming and said the offensive \"intensified the already catastrophic humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people.\" It said Israeli strikes damaged more than 200 schools and left more than 70,000 people homeless. \"There are strong and credible reports of war crimes and other violations of international norms,\" it said, adding that many observers have said war crimes investigations should be undertaken. \"The alternative is de facto impunity,\" it said. It called for the end of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the free passage into the territory of food, medicine, fuel and construction supplies. Another report issued Monday also was critical of the IDF. The report from Physicians for Human Rights said the Gaza incursion violated IDF's own code of ethics. The report by the medical group, which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, cited instances where it said IDF forces did not evacuate injured civilians for days and prevented Palestinian teams from reaching the wounded, and said some of them died as a result. It said 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by IDF fire and 25 were wounded during the IDF operation, and accused the IDF of attacking 34 medical centers in violation of the IDF's own \"ethical code for fighting terror.\" Nevertheless, it said, an IDF investigation is ongoing and its conclusions will be made public once it is complete. But Dr. Dani Filc, PHR-Israel chairman, was skeptical that the investigation would prove useful. \"There are considerable doubts that the IDF is the correct institution to investigate suspicions of these violations,\" he said. \"The IDF's repeated promises to the High Court to look into attacks on medical teams and medical centers have gone unfulfilled, and there are suspicions concerning its seriousness and readiness to carry out the matter.\" The Israeli military did accept criticism Monday on another matter -- the practice of some Israeli soldiers of wearing T-shirts that appear to condone acts of violence against Palestinians. The Israeli daily Haaretz newspaper reported that Israeli soldiers who had finished basic training ordered the shirts, one of which showed a pregnant Arab in the crosshairs of a gun sight with a caption reading \"1 Shot 2 Kills.\" Another showing a small child in a gun's sight was captioned, \"The smaller they are, the harder it is.\" \"The examples presented by The Haaretz reporter are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless,\" the Israeli military said in a written statement. \"This type of humor is unbecoming and should be condemned.\" Israeli soldiers said last week that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Haaretz. How can AMERICA SUPPORT THESE ATROCITIES ??? If ANY OTHER COUNTRY did these things to civilians we would be ripping them a new one every way we could. Why don't we say ANYTHING to these murderers?

Dang does this sound like your gripe. D.J. So Donnie, how proud are you of that legacy? Not very I would hope. So, because America did that in the 1800s should we support Israel doing that TODAY? Haven't we learned from the abuses of the past? And aren't the Jews always preaching about how the world can never let what happened to them at the hands of Hitler happen again? Then how can we let them do this to people? Is it OK for this to happen as long as it isn't happening TO the Jews? As long as the Jews are doing it to someone else, we're ok with that? Which is it? Never again, or it is OK as long as the Jews do it to others? Which is it - you can't have it both ways! I am saying that according to American Principles, and all that is right, people are not supposed to be abusing other people. Systematic extermination is frowned upon by our society; or don't YOU agree Donnie? It is a very simple question Donnie. Right or wrong? Call me crazy but I think America is supposed to support Justice, Freedom, Equality, right vs. wrong, you know the kind of society that makes you PAY for your house, as opposed to killing the inhabitants and moving in. So, Donnie, which way of living do YOU support? Should we be attacking Canada for THEIR land Donnie? Or not. Very simple question, sir. Now apply that to the MURDERERS who have made 4 million refugees and are continuing to KILL the civilians who have been fighting their own extermination. You know who they are, but they want YOUR support Donnie. They are BUYING the US governments' support, and ALL OF US are paying for that CRIME. Do you like that Donnie? Do you LIKE your country being USED for crimes against humanity Donnie? I don't. I want America to remember the difference from right and wrong, and you do too Donnie. Straighten up and fly right.",

This is from the LEADER of the TERRORISTS: CAIRO, Egypt\u2014Osama bin Laden said in a new audio recording released Friday that al-Qaida will continue its holy war against Israel and its allies until it liberates Palestine. The terrorist leader's third statement this year came as President Bush was wrapping up his visit to Israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Jewish state. Bin Laden said the fight for the Palestinian cause was the most important factor driving al-Qaida's war with the West and fueled 19 Muslims to carry out the suicide attacks against the U.S. on September 11. \"To Western nations ... this speech is to understand the core reason of the war between our civilization and your civilizations. I mean the Palestinian cause,\" said bin Laden in the close to 10 minute audiotape. \"The Palestinian cause is the major issue for my (Islamic) nation. It was an important element in fueling me from the beginning and the 19 others with a great motive to fight for those subjected to injustice and the oppressed,\" added bin Laden. The al-Qaida leader said the Western media managed to brainwash people over the past 60 years by \"portraying the Jewish invaders, the occupiers of our land, as the victims while it portrayed us as the terrorists.\" \"Sixty years ago, the Israeli state didn't exist. Instead, it was established on the land of Palestine raped by force,\" said bin Laden. \"Israelis are occupying invaders whom we should fight.\" You can't disreguard this when the \"enemy\" tells you VERY CLEARLY exactly why they are fighting. And it DOES make a lot of sense for people being oppressed, bulldozed, evicted, made into refugees, blockaded, occupied, abused, and murdered to fight back. Granted we did this to the American Indians, and are not being attacked today; but does that make it right for the Israelis to do this today? NO, IT DOES NOT. America must stop supporting the abuse and murder of civilians, and Israel must stop the injustices if there is ever going to be peace in the Middle East.

        "content": "When I read these accounts from their OWN soldiers, while the victims have been claiming these type of abuses for DECADES, I have to wonder how AMERICA can still support Israel?? Further Accounts of Gaza Killings Released JERUSALEM \u2014 In the two months since Israel ended its military assault on Gaza, Palestinians and international rights groups have accused it of excessive force and wanton killing in that operation, but the Israeli military has said it followed high ethical standards and took great care to avoid civilian casualties. Now testimony is emerging from within the ranks of soldiers and officers alleging a permissive attitude toward the killing of civilians and reckless destruction of property that is sure to inflame the domestic and international debate about the army\u2019s conduct in Gaza. On Thursday, the military\u2019s chief advocate general ordered an investigation into a soldier\u2019s account of a sniper killing a woman and her two children who walked too close to a designated no-go area by mistake, and another account of a sharpshooter who killed an elderly woman who came within 100 yards of a commandeered house. When asked why that elderly woman was killed, a squad commander was quoted as saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s great about Gaza \u2014 you see a person on a path, he doesn\u2019t have to be armed, you can simply shoot him. In our case it was an old woman on whom I did not see any weapon when I looked. The order was to take down the person, this woman, the minute you see her. There are always warnings, there is always the saying, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s a terrorist.\u2019 What I felt was, there was a lot of thirst for blood.\u201d The testimonies by soldiers, leaked to the newspapers Maariv and Haaretz, appeared in a journal published by a military preparatory course at the Oranim Academic College in the northern town of Tivon. The academy\u2019s director, Dany Zamir, told Israel Radio, \u201cThose were very harsh testimonies about unjustified shooting of civilians and destruction of property that conveyed an atmosphere in which one feels entitled to use unrestricted force against Palestinians.\u201d The revelations caused an immediate uproar here, with some soldiers and reservists saying they did not recognize the stories being told as accurate. On Friday, Haaretz published much more extensive, although not complete, excerpts from the soldiers\u2019 testimonies. It said the names of the soldiers had been changed and that some details regarding the units involved had been left out. The lengthier accounts showed something of a religious and cultural divide between the witnesses who spoke and the soldiers whose actions they were describing and criticizing. One complained that the soldiers were being fed religious propaganda by the army\u2019s rabbi and that they thought they were waging a holy war. \"The whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war,\" a soldier who was called Ram was quoted as saying. None of the soldiers who described abuses acknowledging having taken part in them. Rather, they spoke of the actions of others with strong disapproval. It was evident that Mr. Zamir objected to the religious nature of some of the discussions and also felt that his concerns, which he had raised earlier in a letter to the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, had not been taken seriously and that was why he published the testimonies. Since the war ended, others have raised similar questions, generating a heated debate within military circles. \u201cAccording to the code, a soldier has to do his utmost to avoid civilian casualties and that involves taking some risk,\u201d said Moshe Halbertal, a Jewish philosophy professor at Hebrew University who, along with three others, rewrote the military ethics code eight years ago. \u201cThat is the question we have to struggle with. From the testimonies of these soldiers, it sounds like they didn\u2019t practice this norm.\u201d Amir Marmor, a 33-year-old history graduate student in Jerusalem and a military reservist, said in an interview with The New York Times that he was stunned to discover the way civilian casualties were discussed in training discussions before his tank unit entered Gaza in January. An Israeli newspaper gave a fuller account on Friday of soldiers\u2019 testimonies alleging loose rules of engagement in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which led to civilian deaths and wanton property destruction. One soldier asserted that extremist rabbis had told troops they were fighting a holy war. The soldier, given the pseudonym Ram in the newspaper article, said the rabbis had \u201cbrought in a lot of booklets and articles, and their message was very clear: We are the Jewish people, we came to this land by a miracle, God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land.\u201d He added that as a commander, he had tried to explain to his men that \u201cnot everyone who is in Gaza is Hamas,\u201d and that \u201cthis war was not a war for the sanctification of the holy name, but rather one to stop the Qassam rockets.\u201d The account, in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, expanded on shorter excerpts printed Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv, a center-right newspaper, and came from a taped conversation among Gaza war veterans at an institute that prepares soldiers before their service. After the materials were published, the military advocate general began an investigation into the allegations. The director of the institute where the discussion occurred, Dany Zamir, published the accounts in his newsletter and leaked them to the newspapers to draw attention to what he considered to be troubling revelations. Mr. Zamir is known to be on the left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum. He is quoted in the excerpts as saying to the soldiers who spoke: \u201cI think it would be important for parents to sit here and hear this discussion. I think it would be an instructive discussion, and also very dismaying and depressing. You are describing an army with very low norms of value, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Earlier excerpts included an account of the killing of an elderly woman by a sharpshooter and the killing of a woman and two children by another sniper. The testimonies published Friday also spoke of the ease with which some houses were damaged. Another soldier said, \u201cWe got an order one day \u2014 all of the equipment, all of the furniture, just clean out the whole house. We threw everything , everything out of the windows to make room. The entire contents of the house went flying out the windows.\u201d The soldier also alleged that when entering buildings, \u201cwe were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified, we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself, where is the logic in this? \u201cFrom above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect incriminated, a terrorist, because they hadn\u2019t fled. I didn\u2019t really understand. On one hand they don\u2019t really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they\u2019re telling us they hadn\u2019t fled so it\u2019s their fault.\u201d America SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS!!!

        "quote": "Originally posted by DougSabbag: When I read these accounts from their OWN soldiers, while the victims have been claiming these type of abuses for DECADES, I have to wonder how AMERICA can still support Israel?? Further Accounts of Gaza Killings Released JERUSALEM \u2014 In the two months since Israel ended its military assault on Gaza, Palestinians and international rights groups have accused it of excessive force and wanton killing in that operation, but the Israeli military has said it followed high ethical standards and took great care to avoid civilian casualties. Now testimony is emerging from within the ranks of soldiers and officers alleging a permissive attitude toward the killing of civilians and reckless destruction of property that is sure to inflame the domestic and international debate about the army\u2019s conduct in Gaza. On Thursday, the military\u2019s chief advocate general ordered an investigation into a soldier\u2019s account of a sniper killing a woman and her two children who walked too close to a designated no-go area by mistake, and another account of a sharpshooter who killed an elderly woman who came within 100 yards of a commandeered house. When asked why that elderly woman was killed, a squad commander was quoted as saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s great about Gaza \u2014 you see a person on a path, he doesn\u2019t have to be armed, you can simply shoot him. In our case it was an old woman on whom I did not see any weapon when I looked. The order was to take down the person, this woman, the minute you see her. There are always warnings, there is always the saying, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s a terrorist.\u2019 What I felt was, there was a lot of thirst for blood.\u201d The testimonies by soldiers, leaked to the newspapers Maariv and Haaretz, appeared in a journal published by a military preparatory course at the Oranim Academic College in the northern town of Tivon. The academy\u2019s director, Dany Zamir, told Israel Radio, \u201cThose were very harsh testimonies about unjustified shooting of civilians and destruction of property that conveyed an atmosphere in which one feels entitled to use unrestricted force against Palestinians.\u201d The revelations caused an immediate uproar here, with some soldiers and reservists saying they did not recognize the stories being told as accurate. On Friday, Haaretz published much more extensive, although not complete, excerpts from the soldiers\u2019 testimonies. It said the names of the soldiers had been changed and that some details regarding the units involved had been left out. The lengthier accounts showed something of a religious and cultural divide between the witnesses who spoke and the soldiers whose actions they were describing and criticizing. One complained that the soldiers were being fed religious propaganda by the army\u2019s rabbi and that they thought they were waging a holy war. \"The whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war,\" a soldier who was called Ram was quoted as saying. None of the soldiers who described abuses acknowledging having taken part in them. Rather, they spoke of the actions of others with strong disapproval. It was evident that Mr. Zamir objected to the religious nature of some of the discussions and also felt that his concerns, which he had raised earlier in a letter to the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, had not been taken seriously and that was why he published the testimonies. Since the war ended, others have raised similar questions, generating a heated debate within military circles. \u201cAccording to the code, a soldier has to do his utmost to avoid civilian casualties and that involves taking some risk,\u201d said Moshe Halbertal, a Jewish philosophy professor at Hebrew University who, along with three others, rewrote the military ethics code eight years ago. \u201cThat is the question we have to struggle with. From the testimonies of these soldiers, it sounds like they didn\u2019t practice this norm.\u201d Amir Marmor, a 33-year-old history graduate student in Jerusalem and a military reservist, said in an interview with The New York Times that he was stunned to discover the way civilian casualties were discussed in training discussions before his tank unit entered Gaza in January. An Israeli newspaper gave a fuller account on Friday of soldiers\u2019 testimonies alleging loose rules of engagement in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which led to civilian deaths and wanton property destruction. One soldier asserted that extremist rabbis had told troops they were fighting a holy war. The soldier, given the pseudonym Ram in the newspaper article, said the rabbis had \u201cbrought in a lot of booklets and articles, and their message was very clear: We are the Jewish people, we came to this land by a miracle, God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land.\u201d He added that as a commander, he had tried to explain to his men that \u201cnot everyone who is in Gaza is Hamas,\u201d and that \u201cthis war was not a war for the sanctification of the holy name, but rather one to stop the Qassam rockets.\u201d The account, in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, expanded on shorter excerpts printed Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv, a center-right newspaper, and came from a taped conversation among Gaza war veterans at an institute that prepares soldiers before their service. After the materials were published, the military advocate general began an investigation into the allegations. The director of the institute where the discussion occurred, Dany Zamir, published the accounts in his newsletter and leaked them to the newspapers to draw attention to what he considered to be troubling revelations. Mr. Zamir is known to be on the left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum. He is quoted in the excerpts as saying to the soldiers who spoke: \u201cI think it would be important for parents to sit here and hear this discussion. I think it would be an instructive discussion, and also very dismaying and depressing. You are describing an army with very low norms of value, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Earlier excerpts included an account of the killing of an elderly woman by a sharpshooter and the killing of a woman and two children by another sniper. The testimonies published Friday also spoke of the ease with which some houses were damaged. Another soldier said, \u201cWe got an order one day \u2014 all of the equipment, all of the furniture, just clean out the whole house. We threw everything , everything out of the windows to make room. The entire contents of the house went flying out the windows.\u201d The soldier also alleged that when entering buildings, \u201cwe were supposed to go up floor by floor, and any person we identified, we were supposed to shoot. I initially asked myself, where is the logic in this? \u201cFrom above they said it was permissible, because anyone who remained in the sector and inside Gaza City was in effect incriminated, a terrorist, because they hadn\u2019t fled. I didn\u2019t really understand. On one hand they don\u2019t really have anywhere to flee to, but on the other hand they\u2019re telling us they hadn\u2019t fled so it\u2019s their fault.\u201d America SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS!!! No wonder we are in a War on Terrorism, considering we are supporting the MURDER of thousands of civilians. THIS HAS TO STOP.",

The report said a working group had documented and verified reports of violations \"too numerous to list.\" For example, on January 15, in a town southwest of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces soldiers ordered an 11-year-old boy to open Palestinians' packages, presumably so that the soldiers would not be hurt if they turned out to contain explosives, the 43-page report said. They then forced the boy to walk in front of them in the town, it said. When the soldiers came under fire, \"the boy remained in front of the group,\" the report said. It said the boy was later released. The report cited two alleged incidents from January 3. In one, it said, after a tank round struck near a house, a father and his two sons -- both younger than 11 -- emerged to look at the damage. \"As they exited their home, IDF soldiers shot and killed them (at the entrance to their house), with the daughter witnessing,\" the report said. In the second, it said, \"Israeli soldiers entered a family house in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City. Standing at the doorstep, they asked the male head of the household to come out and shot him dead, without warning, while he was holding his ID, hands raised up in the air, and then started to fire indiscriminately and without warning into the room where the rest of the family was huddled together. \"The eldest son was shouting in vain the word 'Children' in Hebrew to warn the soldiers. The shooting did not stop until everyone was lying on the floor. The mother and four of the brothers, aged 2-12 years, had been wounded, one of them, aged 4, fatally.\" The alleged instances occurred during Operation Cast Lead, which was launched December 27 to halt rocket attacks into southern Israel from Gaza and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. The U.N. report called the response by Israel disproportionate. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, the report said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said. The report said the Israeli operation resulted in \"a dramatic deterioration of the living conditions of the civilian population.\" It cited \"targeted and indiscriminate\" attacks on hospitals and clinics, water and sewage treatment facilities, government buildings, utilities and farming and said the offensive \"intensified the already catastrophic humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people.\" It said Israeli strikes damaged more than 200 schools and left more than 70,000 people homeless. \"There are strong and credible reports of war crimes and other violations of international norms,\" it said, adding that many observers have said war crimes investigations should be undertaken. \"The alternative is de facto impunity,\" it said. It called for the end of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the free passage into the territory of food, medicine, fuel and construction supplies. Another report issued Monday also was critical of the IDF. The report from Physicians for Human Rights said the Gaza incursion violated IDF's own code of ethics. The report by the medical group, which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, cited instances where it said IDF forces did not evacuate injured civilians for days and prevented Palestinian teams from reaching the wounded, and said some of them died as a result. It said 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by IDF fire and 25 were wounded during the IDF operation, and accused the IDF of attacking 34 medical centers in violation of the IDF's own \"ethical code for fighting terror.\" Nevertheless, it said, an IDF investigation is ongoing and its conclusions will be made public once it is complete. But Dr. Dani Filc, PHR-Israel chairman, was skeptical that the investigation would prove useful. \"There are considerable doubts that the IDF is the correct institution to investigate suspicions of these violations,\" he said. \"The IDF's repeated promises to the High Court to look into attacks on medical teams and medical centers have gone unfulfilled, and there are suspicions concerning its seriousness and readiness to carry out the matter.\" The Israeli military did accept criticism Monday on another matter -- the practice of some Israeli soldiers of wearing T-shirts that appear to condone acts of violence against Palestinians. The Israeli daily Haaretz newspaper reported that Israeli soldiers who had finished basic training ordered the shirts, one of which showed a pregnant Arab in the crosshairs of a gun sight with a caption reading \"1 Shot 2 Kills.\" Another showing a small child in a gun's sight was captioned, \"The smaller they are, the harder it is.\" \"The examples presented by The Haaretz reporter are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless,\" the Israeli military said in a written statement. \"This type of humor is unbecoming and should be condemned.\" Israeli soldiers said last week that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Haaretz.

Haven't we learned from the abuses of the past? And aren't the Jews always preaching about how the world can never let what happened to them at the hands of Hitler happen again? Then how can we let them do this to people? Is it OK for this to happen as long as it isn't happening TO the Jews? As long as the Jews are doing it to someone else, we're ok with that? Which is it? Never again, or it is OK as long as the Jews do it to others? Which is it - you can't have it both ways! I am saying that according to American Principles, and all that is right, people are not supposed to be abusing other people. Systematic extermination is frowned upon by our society; or don't YOU agree Donnie? It is a very simple question Donnie. Right or wrong? Call me crazy but I think America is supposed to support Justice, Freedom, Equality, right vs. wrong, you know the kind of society that makes you PAY for your house, as opposed to killing the inhabitants and moving in. So, Donnie, which way of living do YOU support? Should we be attacking Canada for THEIR land Donnie? Or not. Very simple question, sir. Now apply that to the MURDERERS who have made 4 million refugees and are continuing to KILL the civilians who have been fighting their own extermination. You know who they are, but they want YOUR support Donnie. They are BUYING the US governments' support, and ALL OF US are paying for that CRIME. Do you like that Donnie? Do you LIKE your country being USED for crimes against humanity Donnie? I don't. I want America to remember the difference from right and wrong, and you do too Donnie. Straighten up and fly right.",

This is from the LEADER of the TERRORISTS: CAIRO, Egypt\u2014Osama bin Laden said in a new audio recording released Friday that al-Qaida will continue its holy war against Israel and its allies until it liberates Palestine. The terrorist leader's third statement this year came as President Bush was wrapping up his visit to Israel to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Jewish state. Bin Laden said the fight for the Palestinian cause was the most important factor driving al-Qaida's war with the West and fueled 19 Muslims to carry out the suicide attacks against the U.S. on September 11. \"To Western nations ... this speech is to understand the core reason of the war between our civilization and your civilizations. I mean the Palestinian cause,\" said bin Laden in the close to 10 minute audiotape. \"The Palestinian cause is the major issue for my (Islamic) nation. It was an important element in fueling me from the beginning and the 19 others with a great motive to fight for those subjected to injustice and the oppressed,\" added bin Laden. The al-Qaida leader said the Western media managed to brainwash people over the past 60 years by \"portraying the Jewish invaders, the occupiers of our land, as the victims while it portrayed us as the terrorists.\" \"Sixty years ago, the Israeli state didn't exist. Instead, it was established on the land of Palestine raped by force,\" said bin Laden. \"Israelis are occupying invaders whom we should fight.\" You can't disreguard this when the \"enemy\" tells you VERY CLEARLY exactly why they are fighting. And it DOES make a lot of sense for people being oppressed, bulldozed, evicted, made into refugees, blockaded, occupied, abused, and murdered to fight back. Granted we did this to the American Indians, and are not being attacked today; but does that make it right for the Israelis to do this today? NO, IT DOES NOT. America must stop supporting the abuse and murder of civilians, and Israel must stop the injustices if there is ever going to be peace in the Middle East.
