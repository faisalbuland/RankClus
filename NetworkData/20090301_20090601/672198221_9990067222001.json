When one of your Navy vessels RUNS, from an attack by gun fireing Pirates, it shows cowerdness that other countries will enjoy, and your fleet will suffer the tortures of being labled two bit corwards. You have a responsibility to Americans and your fleet, to acknowlage why the skipper was not allowed to fight back. I pay taxes that support your fleet, so you can tuck your tail and run ?? Who the F` do you think you are ? Ok, so there`s a small chance he`ll get it but I`m sorry...it needs to be said !!",

If it was armed, this was, as you say, a disgraceful act - But I really have a hard time believing that. These pirates are often armed with RPG's and other stuff. If the ship was captured by pirates, and the crew made hostage; what then? \"Never bring a knife to a gunfight\" is an expression I've never had a problem with. Dave",

Like I said in my first post, I blew the image up, and can see no trace of armament. I believe you are right to criticise whomever is responsible for an unarmed ship being in a potential combat zone, all by itself. But I do not believe the Captain should be criticised. Did some members of the crew possess personal arms? So what? And we don't even know that. Very incomplete article. Most of the crew are civilians, and it would be damned embarrasing if they had to surrender or get blown out of the water. Dave",
