Each of the five acted spontaneously and heroically to save the lives of comrades. Each exemplified the medal\u2019s criteria of \u201cgallantry and intrepidity at the risk of one\u2019s own life above and beyond the call of duty.\u201d And each was killed in action or died from wounds received in action. From World War I through Vietnam, the rate of Medal of Honor recipients per 100,000 service members stayed between 2.3 (Korea) and 2.9 (World War II). But since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, only five Medals of Honor have been awarded, a rate of 0.1 per 100,000 \u2014 one in a million. A similar disparity occurs on the second tier of valor awards: Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross and Air Force Cross. Throughout the 20th century, the rate of service cross recipients per 100,000 troops ranged from a low of 19 in Korea to a high of 167 in World War I. But for the post-9/11 wars, it\u2019s only one per 100,000. Why?

I personally wouldn't say they're not worthy, but that appears to be the standard now- you have to die, and since we are saving more wounded than ever before, the chances of being awarded the MOH are going down.",
