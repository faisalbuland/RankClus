        "content": "If you like car shows, the American Legion in Milwaukie, Oregon post 180, is going to have a hot rod and classic car show on the weekend of June 12th 13th and 14th. From what I understand they give all proceeds from that weekend to some charity or the other. They helped a young man with his cancer treatment with a previous show. Milwaukie's American Legion Post 180 is a real community booster and support a lot of the troops with secret squirrel style resupplies. The Post is mostly Old-Timers and some new guys. They have troops from the nearby Guard Units and some From Fort Vancouver (Old Timey Fort) who enjoy the hospitality of this Post. A lot of good people there and they do some really good stuff for the community. I'm gonna really enjoy this cause I LOVE any car show. Big Ones Little Ones. I remember my very first Auto Expo in Los Angeles, when the concept cars were something that would have sold like \"hotcakes\" yet they were never built. I could never figure that one out. I promise that I will be at the event on the second and maybe third day. My Grandson (youngest) turns three on the 12th of June and I won't miss that for redheads or blondes... ...and for you clowns that want to help me spell Milwaukee, Wisconsin, You Don't know Milwaukie, Oregon. Do any of you people have car shows in the local area? Anybody got any pics of recent car shows of shows they took pictures of in the past? Now don't post anything you got off the internet. I like to encourage people to get out and take their own pictures. So up to this event I will be asking for these pictures that you might have taken at a car related event and then after this event I will \"try\" to post the pictures. CAR SHOW.... SUPERSTARrrr... BUMP!!! This message has been edited. Last edited by: sargeant_green, Thu 23 April 2009 04:38 PM Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?",

A lot of good people there and they do some really good stuff for the community. I'm gonna really enjoy this cause I LOVE any car show. Big Ones Little Ones.

I promise that I will be at the event on the second and maybe third day. My Grandson (youngest) turns three on the 12th of June and I won't miss that for redheads or blondes... ...and for you clowns that want to help me spell Milwaukee, Wisconsin, You Don't know Milwaukie, Oregon. Do any of you people have car shows in the local area? Anybody got any pics of recent car shows of shows they took pictures of in the past? Now don't post anything you got off the internet. I like to encourage people to get out and take their own pictures.

From what I understand they give all proceeds from that weekend to some charity or the other. They helped a young man with his cancer treatment with a previous show. Milwaukie's American Legion Post 180 is a real community booster and support a lot of the troops with secret squirrel style resupplies. The Post is mostly Old-Timers and some new guys. They have troops from the nearby Guard Units and some From Fort Vancouver (Old Timey Fort) who enjoy the hospitality of this Post. A lot of good people there and they do some really good stuff for the community. I'm gonna really enjoy this cause I LOVE any car show. Big Ones Little Ones. I remember my very first Auto Expo in Los Angeles, when the concept cars were something that would have sold like \"hotcakes\" yet they were never built. I could never figure that one out. I promise that I will be at the event on the second and maybe third day. My Grandson (youngest) turns three on the 12th of June and I won't miss that for redheads or blondes... ...and for you clowns that want to help me spell Milwaukee, Wisconsin, You Don't know Milwaukie, Oregon. Do any of you people have car shows in the local area? Anybody got any pics of recent car shows of shows they took pictures of in the past? Now don't post anything you got off the internet. I like to encourage people to get out and take their own pictures. So up to this event I will be asking for these pictures that you might have taken at a car related event and then after this event I will \"try\" to post the pictures. CAR SHOW.... SUPERSTARrrr...

I promise that I will be at the event on the second and maybe third day. My Grandson (youngest) turns three on the 12th of June and I won't miss that for redheads or blondes... ...and for you clowns that want to help me spell Milwaukee, Wisconsin, You Don't know Milwaukie, Oregon.

I promise that I will be at the event on the second and maybe third day. My Grandson (youngest) turns three on the 12th of June and I won't miss that for redheads or blondes... ...and for you clowns that want to help me spell Milwaukee, Wisconsin, You Don't know Milwaukie, Oregon. Do any of you people have car shows in the local area? Anybody got any pics of recent car shows of shows they took pictures of in the past? Now don't post anything you got off the internet. I like to encourage people to get out and take their own pictures. So up to this event I will be asking for these pictures that you might have taken at a car related event and then after this event I will \"try\" to post the pictures. CAR SHOW.... SUPERSTARrrr...

I'll pull out my camera on Veterans Day going up 5th. I'll pull out my camera on Tartan Day going up 6th (last weekend). But I won't even bring my camera to the Javits Center. I just collect the brochures, sit in the seats, pizz off the salesmen, head out for a short dive tour, and it's back to the hotel. I'm old, man! Gute Nacht, ...Alex Too bad. Postin pitchurs is a good way to build up the \"street cred\" here. But then you can tell us all about it when you get back or take a laptop and cellular connection and tell us about it while it's on. Excuse me? Given your early history on this website (which I remember far better than I'm sure you wish I did) who the he11 are you to talk to anyone about \"street cred\"? Cram it, \"Sargeant\". ...Alex OK, so I was just kiddin... But I see your not, and speaking of not you have not the familiar ######### posts as: whozit. SO HOW THE HE11 DO I KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!! Take a ribbing or not it's up to you... Now You cram it Sarge, thats an order! Got money for everything but \"VETERANS\" Same old story!",

Milwaukie's American Legion Post 180 is a real community booster and support a lot of the troops with secret squirrel style resupplies. The Post is mostly Old-Timers and some new guys. They have troops from the nearby Guard Units and some From Fort Vancouver (Old Timey Fort) who enjoy the hospitality of this Post. A lot of good people there and they do some really good stuff for the community. I'm gonna really enjoy this cause I LOVE any car show. Big Ones Little Ones. I remember my very first Auto Expo in Los Angeles, when the concept cars were something that would have sold like \"hotcakes\" yet they were never built. I could never figure that one out. I promise that I will be at the event on the second and maybe third day. My Grandson (youngest) turns three on the 12th of June and I won't miss that for redheads or blondes... ...and for you clowns that want to help me spell Milwaukee, Wisconsin, You Don't know Milwaukie, Oregon. Do any of you people have car shows in the local area? Anybody got any pics of recent car shows of shows they took pictures of in the past? Now don't post anything you got off the internet. I like to encourage people to get out and take their own pictures.

A lot of good people there and they do some really good stuff for the community. I'm gonna really enjoy this cause I LOVE any car show. Big Ones Little Ones.

I promise that I will be at the event on the second and maybe third day. My Grandson (youngest) turns three on the 12th of June and I won't miss that for redheads or blondes... ...and for you clowns that want to help me spell Milwaukee, Wisconsin, You Don't know Milwaukie, Oregon. Do any of you people have car shows in the local area? Anybody got any pics of recent car shows of shows they took pictures of in the past? Now don't post anything you got off the internet. I like to encourage people to get out and take their own pictures.
