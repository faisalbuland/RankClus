But when 3,000 people lose their lives in a terrorist attack and it is imperative to try and stop future attacks from these very same terrorists. That's an argument that could have been used for just about every war we've ever been in. If I opposed torture in WWI, would you accuse me of wanting to Seig Heil down the street or learn Japanese? Why is it that all the wars we've ever been in are kid stuff, but this is the \"Real thing?\" quote: Originally posted by NickBrand: The ends justify the means. According to the majority of Americans from the polls I have seen which took a sampling of people nationwide they agree with me. I posted the result of a poll. Over 60 percent of Americans catagorically reject the use of torture. This was BEFORE the release of these memo's. quote: Originally posted by NickBrand: For the liberals who think that it was Bush that made everything non bi-partisan they should take a look at their elected officials. It wasn't just Republicans that knew what was going on but all ranking members of Congress. Congress voted on this question, and voted to ban torture. A vote that really was not necessary since torture is illegal anyway. Being briefed, while under oath not the reveal what you have been breifed on is not exactly \"supporting\" the adminisitration.

Dave So are you saying you don't think this administration is trying to take advantage of this for political purposes? Did Democrats try to take advantage of the fact that Lincoln suspended Habius Corpus during the Civil War? The ends justified the means in this case. Do I think Joe Snuffy should be waterboarded for J walking? F no. But when 3,000 people lose their lives in a terrorist attack and it is imperative to try and stop future attacks from these very same terrorists. The ends justify the means. According to the majority of Americans from the polls I have seen which took a sampling of people nationwide they agree with me. For the liberals who think that it was Bush that made everything non bi-partisan and is evil and corrupt they should take a look at their elected officials. It wasn't just Republicans that knew what was going on but all ranking members of Congress.",

This is found at the following link: \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2009/04/02/myth-percent-guns-mexico-fraction-number-claimed/\" You are aware that this is a memo produced for the Bush administration? Your link concludes, by Fox saying, we really don't know how many times they were waterboarded. Even so, a comparison of ALL the memo's and what Fox states leaves me wondering if they have an agenda... quote: Fox News \u201c-- Up to six applications (something like a dunk) lasting more than 10 seconds but less than 40 seconds per session;\u201d Memo One The water is usually applied from a canteen cup or small watering can. with a Spout. You have orally informed us that till.s procedure triggers an automatic physiological sensation of drowning that the individual cannot control even though he may be aware that he is in fact not drowming. You bave also orally infomlcd. us that it is likely that this procedure would not last more than 20 minutes in anyone application. We also understaIld that a medical expert with SEFJ:: experience will be present throughout this phase and uiat the procedures will be stopped if deemed medically necessary to prevent severe mental or physical ha..rm to Zubaydah. \u201chttp://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/042809_memo1.pdf\u201d Fox News: The Justice Department memos described the maximum allowed use of the waterboard on any detainee, based on tactical training given to U.S. troops to resist interrogations: -- Five days of use in one month, with no more than two \"sessions\" in a day; -- Up to six applications (something like a dunk) lasting more than 10 seconds but less than 40 seconds per session; -- 12 minutes of total \"water application\" in a 24-hour period From Memo Two - Discussing guildlines for the \u201csafe\u201d use of waterboarding: For example, in employing this technique: \u2022 For water temperarure of41\u00b0F, tot.al duration of exposure may not exceed 20 minutes without drying and rewarming. \u2022 For water temperarure of50\u00b0F, total duration ofexposure may not exceed 40 minutes without drying and rewarming.. \u2022 \u00b7For water tempetarure of 59\u00b0P, total d~ration ofexposure may not exceed 60 minutes without drying and rewarming. \u201chttp://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/042809_memo2.pdf\u201d The memo\u2019s make chilling reading. Confining positions. Putting a box around the victims head and introducing insects. Slapping, hanging the victim by his fingers. Natually none of this is torture - Don\u2019t the memo\u2019s say it\u2019s not torture? Memo One tell me that for something to actually BE torture it has to include the pain associated with organ failure or death. I didn\u2019t know that? Is that what the law says? So all things considered, just why do you need Fox to explain this all away? Surely the memo's speak for themselves? Dave",

Dave No nation in the history of the world has won a war because they used torture or didn't use torture is more appropriate. But back on topic regardless the current administration is using this as fodder among other misleading data which has nothing to do with the topic of torture for political gain which was my main point. It is purposeful misleading of the American citizenry in an attempt to sway public oppinion. In essense its propaganda typical of something Chavez or Castro has done in the past.

The legality of enhanced interogation techniques is beside the point. Fact of the matter is President Obama and his administration are using false data to garner support for a political agenda that I believe will have a negative impact on this country. He's using propaganda in the same approach that Hugo and Fidel have used as well as any other dictator.

And of course he actually Ran on this if you recall. Personally I think Obama wants this to go away. But he has limited choice about making it go away. During the Civil War, some Democrats tried to take advantage of Lincolns Acts. And? quote: Originally posted by NickBrand: The ends justified the means in this case. Do I think Joe Snuffy should be waterboarded for J walking? F no. But when 3,000 people lose their lives in a terrorist attack and it is imperative to try and stop future attacks from these very same terrorists. That's an argument that could have been used for just about every war we've ever been in. If I opposed torture in WWI, would you accuse me of wanting to Seig Heil down the street or learn Japanese? Why is it that all the wars we've ever been in are kid stuff, but this is the \"Real thing?\" quote: Originally posted by NickBrand: The ends justify the means. According to the majority of Americans from the polls I have seen which took a sampling of people nationwide they agree with me. I posted the result of a poll. Over 60 percent of Americans catagorically reject the use of torture.

Isn't that in essence the exact same thing all the liberals were *****ing about Bush for?",

This seems to be an ongoing theme with this administration. Mislead the public with outrageous numbers and point the finger at the previous administration and the American people. Take for instance another misleading set of numbers by this administration: the amount of arms that were confiscated in Mexico by authorities from the drug cartels that came from the US. This is found at the following link: \"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2009/04/02/myth-percent-guns-mexico-fraction-number-claimed/\" You are aware that this is a memo produced for the Bush administration? Your link concludes, by Fox saying, we really don't know how many times they were waterboarded. Even so, a comparison of ALL the memo's and what Fox states leaves me wondering if they have an agenda... quote: Fox News \u201c-- Up to six applications (something like a dunk) lasting more than 10 seconds but less than 40 seconds per session;\u201d Memo One The water is usually applied from a canteen cup or small watering can. with a Spout. You have orally informed us that till.s procedure triggers an automatic physiological sensation of drowning that the individual cannot control even though he may be aware that he is in fact not drowming. You bave also orally infomlcd. us that it is likely that this procedure would not last more than 20 minutes in anyone application. We also understaIld that a medical expert with SEFJ:: experience will be present throughout this phase and uiat the procedures will be stopped if deemed medically necessary to prevent severe mental or physical ha..rm to Zubaydah. \u201chttp://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/042809_memo1.pdf\u201d Fox News: The Justice Department memos described the maximum allowed use of the waterboard on any detainee, based on tactical training given to U.S. troops to resist interrogations: -- Five days of use in one month, with no more than two \"sessions\" in a day; -- Up to six applications (something like a dunk) lasting more than 10 seconds but less than 40 seconds per session; -- 12 minutes of total \"water application\" in a 24-hour period From Memo Two - Discussing guildlines for the \u201csafe\u201d use of waterboarding: For example, in employing this technique: \u2022 For water temperarure of41\u00b0F, tot.al duration of exposure may not exceed 20 minutes without drying and rewarming. \u2022 For water temperarure of50\u00b0F, total duration ofexposure may not exceed 40 minutes without drying and rewarming.. \u2022 \u00b7For water tempetarure of 59\u00b0P, total d~ration ofexposure may not exceed 60 minutes without drying and rewarming. \u201chttp://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/042809_memo2.pdf\u201d The memo\u2019s make chilling reading. Confining positions. Putting a box around the victims head and introducing insects. Slapping, hanging the victim by his fingers. Natually none of this is torture - Don\u2019t the memo\u2019s say it\u2019s not torture? Memo One tell me that for something to actually BE torture it has to include the pain associated with organ failure or death. I didn\u2019t know that? Is that what the law says? So all things considered, just why do you need Fox to explain this all away? Surely the memo's speak for themselves? Dave",

Dave No nation in the history of the world has won a war because they used torture or didn't use torture is more appropriate. But back on topic regardless the current administration is using this as fodder among other misleading data which has nothing to do with the topic of torture for political gain which was my main point. It is purposeful misleading of the American citizenry in an attempt to sway public oppinion. In essense its propaganda typical of something Chavez or Castro has done in the past.

I have my own opinion on the enhanced interogation methods used and the historical record by which virtually ALL people that have held the oval office have done misdeeds in a time of crisis. The legality of enhanced interogation techniques is beside the point. Fact of the matter is President Obama and his administration are using false data to garner support for a political agenda that I believe will have a negative impact on this country. He's using propaganda in the same approach that Hugo and Fidel have used as well as any other dictator. I find it highly amusing that the same people that clamored that President Bush lied to the American people to get us into Iraq are the same ones trying to justify why President Obama is virtually doing the exact thing to push his political agenda.

Isn't that in essence the exact same thing all the liberals were *****ing about Bush for? No, I'm saying that Mr. Bush didn't lie to us to get us into Afghanistan. He took advantage of 9/11, but he sure didn't lie to us. Nor is Mr. Obama lying to us about the use of torture. Now it's YOU who is claiming either: a. It's not torture, it's enhanced interogation, or... b. So, it's torture? Big deal, we need to do it. Well, as you can see, I disagree with either of these two. Do you really think that the only reason I have this opinion is because I hate Mr. Bush? Apparentlty you do. Dave My point for starting this thread was that this administration is misleading the US populace with false information. I have my own opinion on the enhanced interogation methods used and the historical record by which virtually ALL people that have held the oval office have done misdeeds in a time of crisis. The legality of enhanced interogation techniques is beside the point. Fact of the matter is President Obama and his administration are using false data to garner support for a political agenda that I believe will have a negative impact on this country. He's using propaganda in the same approach that Hugo and Fidel have used as well as any other dictator. I find it highly amusing that the same people that clamored that President Bush lied to the American people to get us into Iraq are the same ones trying to justify why President Obama is virtually doing the exact thing to push his political agenda. Is this change you can believe in?", 
        "reply": " I see no false data... And that is your underlying premise, is it not? Data false, therefore he's manipulating us. But the way I see it, Data true, therefore he's NOT manipulating us. Dave",
