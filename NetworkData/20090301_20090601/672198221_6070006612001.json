        "content": "S/L I was in the Navy, the Surface Navy for 22 years so I don't need to have you \"explain\" to me about the maintenance practices of the surface Navy which by the way are radically different from what they were 30 years ago. They don't do anything like ROH's anymore, Sleps are such a thing of the past, they just run them for however long and then de-comm them and build new ones. You can debate if that is a good strategy or not but it is in fact what they do and have been doing since the early to mid 90's. THe newest class of SSN is designed to run there entire lives without ever needing to be refitted/refueled. What they do now it's called \"continuos maintenance\" a little availability a few weeks at a time a few times a year. I went through a 6 week one on the Yorktown in 2000. We didn't really NEED anything, what ever they did we certainly could have lived without and you couldn't point to one thing that was different or better after we were done. Basically there are limited dollars in the defense budget and two huge requirements for dollars that GWB chose to never fund. He even after years and years wanted to keep them being looked at as \"unpredicted emergencies\" He always wanted it to be theis last minute \"give me everthing I want yesterday or XXXX will happen\" type of deal. Now some especially from the right may say that this was in fact the \"smart\" way to do it because he always got what he wanted. I think it also had a lot to do with hiding the true cost of the two wars and that was just as important to GWB The smart way or not, the president now says he doesn't want to do it that way he has budgeted for the wars and other \"emergencies\" To turn around and say \"well it's still an emergency just for now\" would be rather hyocritical so to fill that unfunded hole a lot of money funded for other things is going to have to get shifted around. As I said before if GWB had put money in the budget for fighting the wars we would not be having this \"problem\"",

The only ships that as a class got SLEP'd were the CV's and the last one of them was in the 80's. They were done mostly in Philly . How long has that place been closed? The NTU program for the oil burning CG's and DDG's might qualify. In other threads I have given numerous examples of ships that got decommed \"early\", ships that could have been upgraded and were not or even after they were, were still then de-commed in only a few years. Since the 90's \"continuos maintenance\" has been the theory. Pretty much starting with the Burkes and the tail end of the CG's I think it is almost a certainty that even though they are going on 20 years that some, possibly the majority of the Burkes and probably at least one of the last CG's has not been out of the water since they left Ingalls or BIW. I can easily believe that the majority of both have been out of the water only once.

It turned into a big IMO useless dog and pony show that really only proved that you had that radio or what ever, the PMS card and EGL were up to date which they alway were because you always printed out new ones from the online data base, there were no decks of cards and quarterly boards or weekly schedules anymore. That you had the correct tools, test equipment and supplies as PER SPMIG and that you in fact did know how to do the check. Both commands I was at a shore based SIMA and the Yorktown always wanted to get these spotchecks out of the way by normally NLT Wednesday. What did this mean,why did I call them useless? If by noon on Wednesday you know that all your WC/DIV spotchecks are done and there will be none next week or next month then what is keeping you from gundecking all the rest of those checks as long as you know that it can be shown that you at the time you in fact had the stuff to do it and either you took care of any \"paper trail\" IE tagouts or it had none to begin with?

Cross it all off no one is ever going to know. Very little these days is like it once was. The strange and funny or sad, depending on how you look at it, thing is... That even if a piece of equipment has not been used, at least when I was in, it still needed to be PMSed because, people would come along a \"F\" with stuff... I worked mostly on aircraft and aircraft carriers, sailed on them actually and people would just come along and \"F\" with stuff... I actually caught a guy, ship type, sitting in the cockpit of one of our aircraft with a freaking ball peen hammer and breaking gauges!... When I ran and got the shop Chief and told him, he came flying out of our shop and literally snatched the guy out of the cockpit by his shirt collar and if I and two other men hadn't been there, I think he would have beat him to death... When asked why, he remarked, \"I liked the sound the glass made, when it broke!\"... I realize, that things have changed but, to not take a hull out of the water and clean, inspect, repair and retreat it, borders on the insane... If you look at the turret explosion on the Iowa, you can see what caused it and it wasn't sabotage... The PMS on the rams had been gun decked and the powder charge was over rammed and it detonated... I know that ships now, have unmanned engineering spaces, systems controlled from the bridge and the ships systems today, don't require the number of people to man them... The problem is, that ships sail into combat and even though you have \"low maintenance\" systems, ships still take hits, people die and battle damage has to be repaired... If you don't have the bodies, because they are wounded or dead, to make the repairs, the ship looses it's combat readiness... Many things have changed, rates have been combined, some done away with and when this is a good thing, that's great but, when it is to pinch pennies, well, the Navy, the nation is the one that is hurt... I realize the only constant in this world is change but when change is for penurious reasons... The Navy, by nature of it's environment, can't be short changed, is what I have been trying to say, in a nut shell... Again, sorry if I sounded like I was trying to lecture you or talk down to you, I was not... I respect those that have made the rank of Chief, they are the backbone of the Navy and God bless all of those that are, \"with the wearing of the khaki and the anchor\"...

If you look at the turret explosion on the Iowa, you can see what caused it and it wasn't sabotage... The PMS on the rams had been gun decked and the powder charge was over rammed and it detonated... I know that ships now, have unmanned engineering spaces, systems controlled from the bridge and the ships systems today, don't require the number of people to man them... The problem is, that ships sail into combat and even though you have \"low maintenance\" systems, ships still take hits, people die and battle damage has to be repaired... If you don't have the bodies, because they are wounded or dead, to make the repairs, the ship looses it's combat readiness... Many things have changed, rates have been combined, some done away with and when this is a good thing, that's great but, when it is to pinch pennies, well, the Navy, the nation is the one that is hurt... I realize the only constant in this world is change but when change is for penurious reasons... The Navy, by nature of it's environment, can't be short changed, is what I have been trying to say, in a nut shell... Again, sorry if I sounded like I was trying to lecture you or talk down to you, I was not... I respect those that have made the rank of Chief, they are the backbone of the Navy and God bless all of those that are, \"with the wearing of the khaki and the anchor\"...

Sorry about that. My main point remains though. Maintenance practices for the surface fleet, at least the surface fleet are nothing like they once were. Roh's that back in the 70's and well into the 80's were sopmething that happened depending on the type of ship every three to maybe five years and lasted about six months that went away in the 90's. The only ships that as a class got SLEP'd were the CV's and the last one of them was in the 80's. They were done mostly in Philly . How long has that place been closed? The NTU program for the oil burning CG's and DDG's might qualify. In other threads I have given numerous examples of ships that got decommed \"early\", ships that could have been upgraded and were not or even after they were, were still then de-commed in only a few years. Since the 90's \"continuos maintenance\" has been the theory. Pretty much starting with the Burkes and the tail end of the CG's I think it is almost a certainty that even though they are going on 20 years that some, possibly the majority of the Burkes and probably at least one of the last CG's has not been out of the water since they left Ingalls or BIW. I can easily believe that the majority of both have been out of the water only once. If someone had told us this 20 years ago we would have told them that they were out of the GD minds but here we are. You mention PMS well big changes on that front as well. Once we probably did too much or it at least did not make the most sense in the world. I suppose you can think of examples of you own. Here are few of mine. Taking a radio that is online and communicating L&C 5x5 offline to test it's power out, RCV sens other things. Air search RADARs that are tracking Cessna Skyhawks at over 200 miles same thing. Cleaning the air filters every month in a radio that has been turned of for the last 5 weeks. I retired off the Yorktown as an ETC in 01 I also precommed her in 83 as an ET2 I know all the PMS I did then and how much either did not exist anymore or had been spaced way out, monthly out to maybe yearly. \"Spotchecks\" in the way we knew them, after the fact, where it better work the way the card said or be clean like it said or whatever that were a real measure of if you did the PMS and made you do it all because you never knew what was going to be checked got replaced sometime in the 90's with what they called \"online\" spotchecks, basically who ever it was watched you do the PMS. It turned into a big IMO useless dog and pony show that really only proved that you had that radio or what ever, the PMS card and EGL were up to date which they alway were because you always printed out new ones from the online data base, there were no decks of cards and quarterly boards or weekly schedules anymore. That you had the correct tools, test equipment and supplies as PER SPMIG and that you in fact did know how to do the check. Both commands I was at a shore based SIMA and the Yorktown always wanted to get these spotchecks out of the way by normally NLT Wednesday. What did this mean,why did I call them useless? If by noon on Wednesday you know that all your WC/DIV spotchecks are done and there will be none next week or next month then what is keeping you from gundecking all the rest of those checks as long as you know that it can be shown that you at the time you in fact had the stuff to do it and either you took care of any \"paper trail\" IE tagouts or it had none to begin with? Nothing! That radio that was working fine, that Radar that is tracking Cessna's that air filter on that piece of gear that has been off for the last month. Cross it all off no one is ever going to know. Very little these days is like it once was. The strange and funny or sad, depending on how you look at it, thing is... That even if a piece of equipment has not been used, at least when I was in, it still needed to be PMSed because, people would come along a \"F\" with stuff... I worked mostly on aircraft and aircraft carriers, sailed on them actually and people would just come along and \"F\" with stuff... I actually caught a guy, ship type, sitting in the cockpit of one of our aircraft with a freaking ball peen hammer and breaking gauges!... When I ran and got the shop Chief and told him, he came flying out of our shop and literally snatched the guy out of the cockpit by his shirt collar and if I and two other men hadn't been there, I think he would have beat him to death...
