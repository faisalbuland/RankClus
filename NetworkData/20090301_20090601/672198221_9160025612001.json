Over the years listening to Paul Harvey, whether his \"Rest of the Story\" or \"This is news\", I always thought that is what I would expect from either of my grandfathers had I been fortunate enough to meet them. I gained such respect for Paul Harvey over the years with the wisdom he showed which comes with age. His love of informing people. He seemed to always have a certain positiveness about him. Not to mention that he always was a gentleman. And of course his classic pause. \"This is Paul Harvey.........Good Day!\" I \"adopted\" him as my grandfather. So this news to me is like losing a family member. Well he is now re-united with Angel(as he always refered to his wife) & myself & many others will miss him.",

He also was an inductee in the Radio Hall of Fame, as was Lynne. He composed his twice-daily news commentaries from a downtown Chicago office near Lake Michigan. Rising at 3:30 each morning, he ate a bowl of oatmeal, then combed the news wires and spoke with editors across the country in search of succinct tales of American life for his program. At the peak of his career, Harvey reached more than 24 million listeners on more than 1,200 radio stations and charged $30,000 to give a speech. His syndicated column was carried by 300 newspapers.
