The officers case failed to persuade the judge that such training was dangerous or breached any rights, or was 'arbitray or capricious'. The direct application of capsicum spray to the face and eyes of enlistees is designed to do what? Expose them to the effects of pepper spray. That way they'll know what to expect should it be applied in the future or the effect it has if they apply it in SP duties. Pepper spray is banned for use in war by the chemical weapons convention. It isn't banned for peacetime use, either by poolice forces, nor apparently in navy training. Obviously its use is opposed by some naval officers.",
