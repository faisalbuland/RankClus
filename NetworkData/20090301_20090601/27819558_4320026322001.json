        "content": "Another Phony Rationale for Delay on Gay Troops By Nathaniel Frank Aurthor, \"Unfriendly Fire\" and a Senior Research Fellow, Palm Center In recent weeks, this and other forums have seen heated debate, largely among the left, about whether, when, and how to end discrimination against gays in the military. Until now, the answer given by many liberals was that Obama needs time--time to deal with higher priorities like the economy, to spend political capital on more important goals, to build political consensus for eventual repeal once everything else is all taken care of. Ending the discharge of gay troops--no matter the terrible cost to our soldiers and to our national security efforts--has been considered a \"distraction.\" But a big part of this thinking was rooted in the mistaken belief that only Congress can lift the ban, and that a battle on Capitol Hill would mean dragging the nation through an agonizing repeat of the culture wars of 1993. Last week, a new study showed that Obama can end the discharges with an immediate executive order using the \"stop-loss\" authority that Congress has already granted the commander-in-chief (disclaimer: I was a co-author of that study). Response to this idea has been swift. This weekend, a petition circulated by Courage Campaign was signed by over 95,000 people asking Obama to suspend the ban immediately. The petitioners want the president to stop the discharge of Lt. Dan Choi, an openly gay Arabic translator and Iraq War combat leader, \"and any other soldier as a result of the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy.\" The White House switchboard was flooded with calls at the hands of Knights Out, and other groups of gay veterans who want to be able to serve their country with the honesty and integrity such service demands. Congressman Rush Holt has also called for an executive order lifting the ban. Read the full article at >>> >>>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathaniel-frank/another-phony-rationale-f_b_204671.html",

Over the weekend, a petition was signed by over 84,000 people asking Obama to suspend the gay ban immediately and stop the discharge of Lt. Dan Choi, a West Point graduate and Iraq War combat veteran who is openly gay and says his subordinates fully support him. On Friday, the White House was asked for the second time whether it would intervene and place a moratorium on further gay discharges. But Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that using the president's power to halt the firings was \"not the way to seek any lasting or durable solution\" to the problem, and that the \"only durable solution\" is for Congress to make the change. But Nathaniel Frank, senior research fellow at the Palm Center, said the White House is misstating the case. \"An executive order would stop the bleeding overnight,\" said Frank, who is author of \"Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America.\" \"Reinstating the gay ban after that would be very unlikely. Politically, it would be tough given that three quarters of the public supports equality.
