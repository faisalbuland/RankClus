You've posted a link, Your link says nothing to confirm this last statement. Your link does however say: quote: They also warned that harsh techniques cast into doubt the reliability of the information gleaned during the interrogation. \"A subject in extreme pain may provide an answer, any answer or many answers in order to get the pain to stop,\" the training officials said in their memo. The attachment also discussed the fact that using extreme physical and psychological coercion - with the word extreme underlined to differentiate from the methods used in survival training - would constitute torture. If ths method was so effective, then just why did they waterboard this one guy 83 times a month? Is it because they didn't believe what he told them? Did they believe the results from #83, as opposed to #1? And can you tell me Osama bin Laden is? Supposedly back around then we were supposed to momentarily get him. Could it be that the answers they got were, well, \"unreliable?\" But I tell you this, work, doesn't work, it's not for Americans to use. We hang people for using torture, and we hang them for good reason. Dave",

I'm still alarmed about that today. I'm not some ivory-tower type; I served for 14 years in the U.S. Air Force, began my career as a Special Operations pilot flying helicopters, saw combat in Bosnia and Kosovo, became an Air Force counterintelligence agent, then volunteered to go to Iraq to work as a senior interrogator.
