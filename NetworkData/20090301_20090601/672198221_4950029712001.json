Cuomo said his office will investigate whether the employees were involved in the insurance giant's near-collapse and whether the $165 million in bonus payments are fraudulent under New York state law. HE later said AIG had missed the deadline and he was issuing subpoenas for the information \" Statements like this provide even more entertainment when given more often: exerpt from article in the link: \"Said Obama: \"All across the country, there are people who work hard and meet their responsibilities every day, without the benefit of government bailouts or multimillion-dollar bonuses. And all they ask is that everyone, from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, play by the same rules.\"",
