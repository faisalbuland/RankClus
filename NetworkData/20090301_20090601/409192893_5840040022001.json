I just got done reading Colin Powell's book for the second time and I got to thinking about what he described as the inflated awards system for Soldiers in Vietnam. He described awards \"packages\" for outgoing commanders and awards that either never should have been given or that should have been downgraded. So - my question is this: Are there any Veterans who have seen awards given out this way? I guess I'm primarily looking for the opinions of Vietnam vets sense that was what Powell was talking about, but anyone with any knowledge can feel free to chime in.

Most Soldiers were more than a single instance and when something extraordinary happened, those recommending didn't just look at the isolated incident, they looked how that Soldier normally behaved. I didn't understand. You do think I was trying to start crap? Yes and No. I am a bit sensitive due to working with Soldiers and Vets. Sorry if I seem bitter. I have taken so much crap and seen so much given (Today OEF/OIF)about medals and citations. It is all perception of certain REMF's that have little knowledge of what took place. I provided Military Honors for a WWII Vet a few weeks ago. His only individual citation was a DSC. He personally killed 21 Germans and led his 6-man squad in capturing another 128 SS Troops. Not a member of his squad was wounded! I have contacted local Congress members to have it upgraded to MOH! So Far, not even a response to look into the matter. I have also worked with Soldiers who served in OIF (Activated NG) and found similar discrepencies. A Soldier on Patrol in Humvee took a large chunk of shrapnel in his leg, spent a few days in hospital, and along with hearing loss and TBI was released and retired. It took over 6 months to get him the PH - his only medal! Another from the same unit when helping out fellow Soldiers hit by IED was hit in face with a rock (over 6 inch in diameter) which broke nose, shattered some teeth, and cut up the face. He was denied a PH because \"it was probably just an angry kid who threw it.\" In my personal case, was I more deserving of the citations I received because I carried the zippo on my back than the grunts along side who protected me so I could get into range?

Most Soldiers were more than a single instance and when something extraordinary happened, those recommending didn't just look at the isolated incident, they looked how that Soldier normally behaved.

        "reply": " Yes and No. I am a bit sensitive due to working with Soldiers and Vets. Sorry if I seem bitter. I have taken so much crap and seen so much given (Today OEF/OIF)about medals and citations. It is all perception of certain REMF's that have little knowledge of what took place. I provided Military Honors for a WWII Vet a few weeks ago. His only individual citation was a DSC. He personally killed 21 Germans and led his 6-man squad in capturing another 128 SS Troops. Not a member of his squad was wounded! I have contacted local Congress members to have it upgraded to MOH! So Far, not even a response to look into the matter. I have also worked with Soldiers who served in OIF (Activated NG) and found similar discrepencies. A Soldier on Patrol in Humvee took a large chunk of shrapnel in his leg, spent a few days in hospital, and along with hearing loss and TBI was released and retired. It took over 6 months to get him the PH - his only medal!

So - my question is this: Are there any Veterans who have seen awards given out this way? I guess I'm primarily looking for the opinions of Vietnam vets sense that was what Powell was talking about, but anyone with any knowledge can feel free to chime in. Thanks. try to research this Grenada, number or army troops involved, versus number of medals awarded. Marines, number of troops involved, versus number of medals awarded. you will be astonished saw it first hand",
