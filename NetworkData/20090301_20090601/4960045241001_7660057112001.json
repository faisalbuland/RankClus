The times do seem to certainly point to the end, when? I dunno, but I truly believe that events in the world show that it is near. The recent election and the what I call push for a new world order is prophetically real. I don't for one minute believe in the predictions of Nostrodamus. Some of the thins he predicted came true, well he got lucky!!! The Bible however, is not in error, things are happening just as predicted and no one will proclaim the exact day of the end except God himself when he tells his Son, Jesus Christ to go get his children. It could be tonight, it could be tomorrow, it could be years from now. When the temple is started to be rebuilt in Jerusalem and sacrifices are once again made look up for your redemption draweth neigh. Just be sure your ready no matter when. It doesn't matter when the world comes to an end, just be eternally ready, that's all that matters.",

As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of God. Everyone laughed at little old Noah. What a fool for building an Ark and doing as he was told because a flood was coming. Well, too bad the guys that laughed couldn't stick around to tell you what happened to them, especially when they hammered away on the door to the Ark so they could get in. They saw their demise. We all will see our demise, but when Armaggeden does take place, I know that for myself, I plan on listening to what others call foolishness. I will be ready. The fool says in his heart, \"There is no God\" If you believe that then you are fools. God is not mocked and whatsoever a man sows he will reap. Forever man has mocked God and man has reaped the rewards of his foolishness. Unfortunately the rain falls on the just as well as the unjust. Just my opinion.",
