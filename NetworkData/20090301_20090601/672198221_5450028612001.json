Cricket is the subcontinent's major sport (to give you an idea more people probably regularly play it there than simply watch the baseball \"World Series\" on the telly) so for terrorists to get this close in to one of Test cricket's major teams in Pakistan is a very big deal for them. Not only is the ineffectiveness of the security services there shown up but the likelihood that no Test sides will visit for the foreseeable future is going to be a constant reminder of that ineffectiveness. When the head of Pakistan's ISI (Inter Service Intelligence) agency was sent to India after the Bombay attack I wondered if Islamabad was beginning to tire of the ISI's apparent cosiness with the Islamists. With the ISI having dropped a major bollock on this one I wonder if we might be about to see a bit of a power struggle between the government and its semi-detached spooks.",
