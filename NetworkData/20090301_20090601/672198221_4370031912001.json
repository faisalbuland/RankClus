But I keep forgetting, we are now in a police state and we are there to serve them, not the other way around. Although I disagree with the way the officer handled this case, he technically was correct. Again experience of the officer comes into contention. Conducting a traffic stop is basically for all purposes an arrest. Depending on the policy of his department (even though the Chief disapproved of this officers actions) they may have well been in line with policy. Stop the offender, Verify credentials, release on summons. Five minutes max in most cases. If the driver/passenger just complied with officer instructions it probably would have gone a lot faster. Both the occupants in the car could have done a lot to help the situation instead of the way they behaved.

This was the most important thing on his mind and some of the comments on this site shows that they agree with this attitude. that shows what kind of world we're sinking into. The police chief doesn't agree with the cop . But have a good heart. There are State legislatures at this very moment determining of the power of suspension of officers should not rest with poltical appointed judges (demanded by Union reps)instead of elected Sheriff's. If that happens these cowboys with a legal weapon will almost have a free hand at harassment. Doesn't matter if the man plays football or sells shoes for a living.

        "reply": "after viewing the episode a number of times we saw a nurse from the hospital confirm Moats story, two security guards at the hospital confirm the story and a police officer from another district explain the same to the arresting officer. After 15 minutes of holding the citizen at gun point he gave Moats a ticket. This was the most important thing on his mind and some of the comments on this site shows that they agree with this attitude. that shows what kind of world we're sinking into. The police chief doesn't agree with the cop . But have a good heart. There are State legislatures at this very moment determining of the power of suspension of officers should not rest with poltical appointed judges (demanded by Union reps)instead of elected Sheriff's. If that happens these cowboys with a legal weapon will almost have a free hand at harassment. Doesn't matter if the man plays football or sells shoes for a living. It just a damn shame he has to be famous to get recognized and hopefully some justice.",

Although I disagree with the way the officer handled this case, he technically was correct. Again experience of the officer comes into contention. Conducting a traffic stop is basically for all purposes an arrest. Depending on the policy of his department (even though the Chief disapproved of this officers actions) they may have well been in line with policy. Stop the offender, Verify credentials, release on summons. Five minutes max in most cases. If the driver/passenger just complied with officer instructions it probably would have gone a lot faster. Both the occupants in the car could have done a lot to help the situation instead of the way they behaved.

The Officers experience is what led him to respond this way. Since no one here can speak to that we just don't know. I don't believe this case alone will result in the officers termination because technically he did nothing wrong, he'll probably will just wind up going to get some sensitivity training or some garbage like that. Although I think his behavior could have been done differently, he won't be fired unless that PD can show where the officer was trained to respond differently or the officer is on probation or has a long history of behavioral issues. This is not a police state, far from it. This officer was indeed serving his community in some cases that means causing inconvenience to individual citizens by detaining/arresting them.

You cannot expect that JQ Public is going to react in accordance with the text \"best course of action.\" That is a given The Officers experience is what led him to respond this way. Since no one here can speak to that we just don't know. The officer did on Friday apologize for his actions... He is also not that experienced. Have you listened to the raw feed? While he was talking to the Plano officer in the last 2 minutes of the tape is a good listen as to jis mindset... at least after the fact. I don't believe this case alone will result in the officers termination because technically he did nothing wrong, he'll probably will just wind up going to get some sensitivity training or some garbage like that. Although I think his behavior could have been done differently, he won't be fired unless that PD can show where the officer was trained to respond differently or the officer is on probation or has a long history of behavioral issues. This is not a police state, far from it. I do agree here... he should not be fired. At three years experience he is still learning the job. This officer was indeed serving his community in some cases that means causing inconvenience to individual citizens by detaining/arresting them. It's the overall mission to make the community safer. Point is that he handled the stop improperly... and caused embarassment to his department.",

Both parties are at fault, although I understand the family members are emotionally upset, their best course of action instead of arguing with the officer would be to calm down are state their case, that would take the officer off the defensive and put him into a better mindset to help these people. The Officers experience is what led him to respond this way. Since no one here can speak to that we just don't know. I don't believe this case alone will result in the officers termination because technically he did nothing wrong, he'll probably will just wind up going to get some sensitivity training or some garbage like that. Although I think his behavior could have been done differently, he won't be fired unless that PD can show where the officer was trained to respond differently or the officer is on probation or has a long history of behavioral issues. This is not a police state, far from it. This officer was indeed serving his community in some cases that means causing inconvenience to individual citizens by detaining/arresting them.

Although I disagree with the way the officer handled this case, he technically was correct. Again experience of the officer comes into contention. Conducting a traffic stop is basically for all purposes an arrest. Depending on the policy of his department (even though the Chief disapproved of this officers actions) they may have well been in line with policy. Stop the offender, Verify credentials, release on summons. Five minutes max in most cases. If the driver/passenger just complied with officer instructions it probably would have gone a lot faster. Both the occupants in the car could have done a lot to help the situation instead of the way they behaved. Both parties are at fault, although I understand the family members are emotionally upset, their best course of action instead of arguing with the officer would be to calm down are state their case, that would take the officer off the defensive and put him into a better mindset to help these people. The Officers experience is what led him to respond this way. Since no one here can speak to that we just don't know. I don't believe this case alone will result in the officers termination because technically he did nothing wrong, he'll probably will just wind up going to get some sensitivity training or some garbage like that. Although I think his behavior could have been done differently, he won't be fired unless that PD can show where the officer was trained to respond differently or the officer is on probation or has a long history of behavioral issues.

The military is full of people that say if you haven't BTDT your opinion is of little value. Same applies here.",

Look the cop and the driver did their duty and pulled over. The man was in a hospital parking lot, all the cop had to do was walk his lazy azz up to the room with the man and it would have avoided all of this. No wonder a woman can be attacked in broad day light and no one would help her, with some folks like some of you that defend this type of irresponsible behavior on a PEACE officer that is suppose to be SERVING his communities, not being a SS guard to it. But I keep forgetting, we are now in a police state and we are there to serve them, not the other way around. Although I disagree with the way the officer handled this case, he technically was correct. Again experience of the officer comes into contention. Conducting a traffic stop is basically for all purposes an arrest. Depending on the policy of his department (even though the Chief disapproved of this officers actions) they may have well been in line with policy. Stop the offender, Verify credentials, release on summons. Five minutes max in most cases. If the driver/passenger just complied with officer instructions it probably would have gone a lot faster. Both the occupants in the car could have done a lot to help the situation instead of the way they behaved. That is an unreasonable expectation based solely on your expectation of your job duties. You would have everyone conform to your ideal in the mechanics of a traffic stop. That simply just is not possible in all cases. As this one has shown you. Ride along sometime with your local EMTs sometime just to gain some experience in just how emotional some stops can get. (LOL! What cops see only occasionally, EMTs see multiple times daily) Those were nice people that while broke the civil/criminal statutes of the state of Texas... did so in a relatively safe manner. Both parties are at fault, although I understand the family members are emotionally upset, their best course of action instead of arguing with the officer would be to calm down are state their case, that would take the officer off the defensive and put him into a better mindset to help these people. If you are/were a Peace officer, you had to have had some training in managing traffic stops. The cop was already out of the supportive mindset as the drawn and pointed handgun represents. You cannot expect that JQ Public is going to react in accordance with the text \"best course of action.\" That is a given The Officers experience is what led him to respond this way. Since no one here can speak to that we just don't know. The officer did on Friday apologize for his actions... He is also not that experienced. Have you listened to the raw feed? While he was talking to the Plano officer in the last 2 minutes of the tape is a good listen as to jis mindset... at least after the fact. I don't believe this case alone will result in the officers termination because technically he did nothing wrong, he'll probably will just wind up going to get some sensitivity training or some garbage like that. Although I think his behavior could have been done differently, he won't be fired unless that PD can show where the officer was trained to respond differently or the officer is on probation or has a long history of behavioral issues. This is not a police state, far from it. I do agree here... he should not be fired. At three years experience he is still learning the job. This officer was indeed serving his community in some cases that means causing inconvenience to individual citizens by detaining/arresting them. It's the overall mission to make the community safer. Point is that he handled the stop improperly... and caused embarassment to his department.",
