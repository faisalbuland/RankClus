Master Sgt. John Hatley, 40, will be reduced in rank to private, forfeit all pay and receive a dishonorable discharge, a jury of eight Army officers and noncommissioned officers decided. He has the possibility of parole after serving 20 years. Hatley and his wife, who sat behind him in the public gallery, both showed no emotion when the sentence was read out. Hatley was found guilty Wednesday of premeditated murder and conspiracy in the execution-style killings of the detainees. He was acquitted of premeditated murder in a separate January 2007 incident in which a wounded Iraqi insurgent was shot and killed. Sad thing to go on, and happen.",

It may be a few decades, but sooner or later they'll cash in on it; it took a while for them to start making movies about the Nam, but eventually the wound's scabbed over in the public mind sufficiently for them to do so and, in a few instances, do a good flick!
