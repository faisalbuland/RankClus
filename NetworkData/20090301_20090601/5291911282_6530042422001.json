Will need an Army of foreign ambassadors to negotiate with all the countries on rates and deals. Next will be tour guides. Don't forget insurance. Gotta cover everybody for medical, then have the liability in case the Captain gets waxed and plows into something. That's just starters. It never ends.

Let me start by introducing myself, I amMr. Patrick Y. B. Fung, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer ofthe operations of the Wing Hang Bank, Hong Kong. I have a secured businessproposal for you; Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client General Ibrahim Moussa who waswith the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixeddeposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Million, FiveHundred United States Dollars ($20,500,000.00) in my branch. Uponmaturity, several notice was sent to him, even during the war early lastyear. Again after the war another notification was sent and still noresponse came from him. We later found out that General Ibrahim Moussa andhis family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit theirhome. After further investigation it was also discovered that General IbrahimMoussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers includingthe paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the lasttime he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in mybank. So, Twenty Million, Five Hundred United States Dollars($20,500,000.00) is still lying in my bank and no one will ever comeforward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws ofmy country at the expiration 8 years, the funds will revert to theownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody comes forward to claim thefunds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that youwill beable to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shallcome out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare thenecessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you toprovide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney cancommence his job.

Let me start by introducing myself, I amMr. Patrick Y. B. Fung, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer ofthe operations of the Wing Hang Bank, Hong Kong. I have a secured businessproposal for you; Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client General Ibrahim Moussa who waswith the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixeddeposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Million, FiveHundred United States Dollars ($20,500,000.00) in my branch. Uponmaturity, several notice was sent to him, even during the war early lastyear. Again after the war another notification was sent and still noresponse came from him. We later found out that General Ibrahim Moussa andhis family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit theirhome. After further investigation it was also discovered that General IbrahimMoussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers includingthe paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the lasttime he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in mybank. So, Twenty Million, Five Hundred United States Dollars($20,500,000.00) is still lying in my bank and no one will ever comeforward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws ofmy country at the expiration 8 years, the funds will revert to theownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody comes forward to claim thefunds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that youwill beable to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shallcome out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare thenecessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you toprovide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney cancommence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorneywill also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessaryapproval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds toan account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt alegalized method and the attorney will prepare all necessary legaldocuments. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all mattersconcerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to yournominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% foryou. Should you be interested, please send me the following informationsbelow: 1. Full Names2. Current Residential Address3. Country of Origin I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below and finallyafter that, I shall provide you with more details of this transaction.Your earliest response to this letter will be highly appreciated.
