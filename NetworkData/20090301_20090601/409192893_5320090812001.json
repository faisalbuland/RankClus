The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 47% of union members hold that view while only 18% disagree. But those who don\u2019t belong to a union hold a different perspective. By a 56% to 14% margin, they believe that most workers do not want to belong to a union. As for personal preference, only nine percent (9%) of non-union workers would like to join a union. Eighty-one percent (81%) would not. Even among those who are worried about losing their jobs in the near future, only nine percent (9%) would like to join a union. There is also no difference in a desire for union membership between those whose firms are hiring and those who are laying people off. Employees of firms with fewer than 50 employees are less likely to belong to a union and less likely to be interested in a union. All together, 24% of workers either belong to a union or would like to do so. At the same time, 59% of workers belong to the investor class and own at least $5,000 worth of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For those who see unions as one side in a battle between labor and management, it\u2019s worth noting that most union members have a foot in each camp: 54% of union members also belong to the investor class. Government employees are far more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. They are also less likely to be investors. Forty-one percent (41%) of those on the public payroll belong to a union while 42% are investors. Among private sector employees, just 11% belong to a union while 68% are investors. As for entrepreneurs, eight percent (8%) belong to a union, and 56% invest in companies other than just their own. Government employees are far more likely to believe that most workers want to belong to a union. Thirty-five percent (35%) of government employees hold this view, while 33% disagree and 32% are not sure. Among those who work in the private sector, just 16% believe most workers want to belong to a union while 53% disagree. Among non-union workers who make less than $40,000 annually, 16% would like to belong to a union. Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans and politically unaffiliated workers to belong to a union. Democrats who do not belong to a union are also far more likely than others to want union membership. By a 34% to 27% margin, Democrats believe that most workers want to belong to a union. However, 40% of those in President Obama\u2019s party are not sure. Sixty-one percent (61%) of Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe most workers want to be unionized, a view shared by the plurality (49%) of adults not affiliated with either party. In a survey in September, 55% of Americans had at least also a somewhat favorable opinion of labor unions, including 19% with a Very Favorable view. Thirty-five percent (35%) held a negative view of unions. <edit>",

I wonder how much of our manufacturing base we would still have in America, if unions hadn't put the cost of a company's product out of reach? Unions have pushed up the wages in many companies, but the companies can no longer compete with the world market. People will look for the bargain if given a choice. I personally would like to buy only American- made products, but many of the products that are American-made are expensive due to union action. I have to purchase things based on my ability to pay for them and that goes for many in this country. I buy American-made cars, from union-run factories and the cars are okay, but they don't stack up to some foreign cars that are built here in America or overseas. Is there a difference in the way these factories are run? I hear that the pride of workmanship is different in the foreign companies. American union members have gotten the idea that they can do a crappy job, because the union will cover their butt and I have personally seen this happen as a non-union worker in a shop that had a couple of union groups. There are numerous instances of unions causing such a fuss over a prospective firing, that the company just capitulated. What good does this kind of action do? The teacher's unions in many states have put an umbrella over poor performing teachers for years and that is why a lousy teacher stays on to continue doing a lousy job. Because of this, our kids suffer. The postal unions keep lousy workers from getting canned and we have to put up with lousy mail service. I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack over this, but I don't think unions are all that great. There is a lot of corruption, coercion, kick backs, bribes, and other illegal activity that makes unions very unappealling. If they could clean up their acts and do away with the strong-arm tactics, they might be useful tools for worker welfare. Stories abound about how unions, and their bosses and officers blow huge amounts of money on lavish \"conventions\" and such. Lots of stories about boozing, sleeping around, gambling, and who knows what else, and all on the backs of the union members and the dues they pay. Unions spend huge amounts to influence campaigns and \"punish\" workers who have a different opinion from the union line of thought. If the truth be known, I would imagine many workers would like to be able to have their own opinion about the people they would vote for. I read several articles where union thugs were using tactics that caused extensive damage and some injuries, at campaign offices and party offices of the Republicans around the country. There were other articles of intimidation of workers who were undecided or had decided against unionization. If this is what unionization is all about, then unions can just go away. Granted, there has to be a way of getting the corporations and companies to cooperate and work with employees, but if it means having to put up with thugs and slugs from a union and their dangerous and illegal activities; looking for some other way would be better. Unions may just be dinosaurs that need to die off. Some more modern form of binding arbitration may be in the future of workers and that might be better for all.",

My first job out of the Army was as a welder's helper in a non-union shop in an anti-union state. I had a wife and kid at the time. The wage was $1.50 an hour. I moved up pretty quickly to lead welder, because of skills I'd learned from my father (an AFL-CIO man), and was paid $4.00 and hour - - Could you live on that? Unions can be corrupted, just like anything else, but organization and job action in the hands of the workers themselves is the only hedge against wage slavery...",

        "content": "I here a lot of union and pro-union people making claims that non-union workers want unions. This kind of blows that out of the water. But we all knew this Just 9% of Non-Union Workers Want to Join Union Monday, March 16, 2009 'http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/jobs_employment/just_9_of_non_union_workers_want_to_join_union' Union members tend to believe that most workers want to join a labor union. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 47% of union members hold that view while only 18% disagree. But those who don\u2019t belong to a union hold a different perspective. By a 56% to 14% margin, they believe that most workers do not want to belong to a union. As for personal preference, only nine percent (9%) of non-union workers would like to join a union. Eighty-one percent (81%) would not. Even among those who are worried about losing their jobs in the near future, only nine percent (9%) would like to join a union. There is also no difference in a desire for union membership between those whose firms are hiring and those who are laying people off. Employees of firms with fewer than 50 employees are less likely to belong to a union and less likely to be interested in a union. All together, 24% of workers either belong to a union or would like to do so. At the same time, 59% of workers belong to the investor class and own at least $5,000 worth of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For those who see unions as one side in a battle between labor and management, it\u2019s worth noting that most union members have a foot in each camp: 54% of union members also belong to the investor class. Government employees are far more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. They are also less likely to be investors. Forty-one percent (41%) of those on the public payroll belong to a union while 42% are investors. Among private sector employees, just 11% belong to a union while 68% are investors. As for entrepreneurs, eight percent (8%) belong to a union, and 56% invest in companies other than just their own. Government employees are far more likely to believe that most workers want to belong to a union. Thirty-five percent (35%) of government employees hold this view, while 33% disagree and 32% are not sure. Among those who work in the private sector, just 16% believe most workers want to belong to a union while 53% disagree. Among non-union workers who make less than $40,000 annually, 16% would like to belong to a union. Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans and politically unaffiliated workers to belong to a union. Democrats who do not belong to a union are also far more likely than others to want union membership. By a 34% to 27% margin, Democrats believe that most workers want to belong to a union. However, 40% of those in President Obama\u2019s party are not sure. Sixty-one percent (61%) of Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe most workers want to be unionized, a view shared by the plurality (49%) of adults not affiliated with either party. In a survey in September, 55% of Americans had at least also a somewhat favorable opinion of labor unions, including 19% with a Very Favorable view. Thirty-five percent (35%) held a negative view of unions. <edit>",

        "reply": "I here a lot of union and pro-union people making claims that non-union workers want unions. This kind of blows that out of the water. But we all knew this Just 9% of Non-Union Workers Want to Join Union Monday, March 16, 2009 'http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/jobs_employment/just_9_of_non_union_workers_want_to_join_union' Union members tend to believe that most workers want to join a labor union. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 47% of union members hold that view while only 18% disagree. But those who don\u2019t belong to a union hold a different perspective. By a 56% to 14% margin, they believe that most workers do not want to belong to a union. As for personal preference, only nine percent (9%) of non-union workers would like to join a union. Eighty-one percent (81%) would not. Even among those who are worried about losing their jobs in the near future, only nine percent (9%) would like to join a union. There is also no difference in a desire for union membership between those whose firms are hiring and those who are laying people off. Employees of firms with fewer than 50 employees are less likely to belong to a union and less likely to be interested in a union. All together, 24% of workers either belong to a union or would like to do so. At the same time, 59% of workers belong to the investor class and own at least $5,000 worth of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For those who see unions as one side in a battle between labor and management, it\u2019s worth noting that most union members have a foot in each camp: 54% of union members also belong to the investor class. Government employees are far more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. They are also less likely to be investors. Forty-one percent (41%) of those on the public payroll belong to a union while 42% are investors. Among private sector employees, just 11% belong to a union while 68% are investors. As for entrepreneurs, eight percent (8%) belong to a union, and 56% invest in companies other than just their own. Government employees are far more likely to believe that most workers want to belong to a union. Thirty-five percent (35%) of government employees hold this view, while 33% disagree and 32% are not sure.

Unions can be corrupted, just like anything else, but organization and job action in the hands of the workers themselves is the only hedge against wage slavery... I wonder how much of our manufacturing base we would still have in America, if unions hadn't put the cost of a company's product out of reach? Unions have pushed up the wages in many companies, but the companies can no longer compete with the world market. People will look for the bargain if given a choice. I personally would like to buy only American- made products, but many of the products that are American-made are expensive due to union action. I have to purchase things based on my ability to pay for them and that goes for many in this country. I buy American-made cars, from union-run factories and the cars are okay, but they don't stack up to some foreign cars that are built here in America or overseas. Is there a difference in the way these factories are run? I hear that the pride of workmanship is different in the foreign companies. American union members have gotten the idea that they can do a crappy job, because the union will cover their butt and I have personally seen this happen as a non-union worker in a shop that had a couple of union groups. There are numerous instances of unions causing such a fuss over a prospective firing, that the company just capitulated. What good does this kind of action do? The teacher's unions in many states have put an umbrella over poor performing teachers for years and that is why a lousy teacher stays on to continue doing a lousy job. Because of this, our kids suffer. The postal unions keep lousy workers from getting canned and we have to put up with lousy mail service. I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack over this, but I don't think unions are all that great. There is a lot of corruption, coercion, kick backs, bribes, and other illegal activity that makes unions very unappealling. If they could clean up their acts and do away with the strong-arm tactics, they might be useful tools for worker welfare. Stories abound about how unions, and their bosses and officers blow huge amounts of money on lavish \"conventions\" and such. Lots of stories about boozing, sleeping around, gambling, and who knows what else, and all on the backs of the union members and the dues they pay. Unions spend huge amounts to influence campaigns and \"punish\" workers who have a different opinion from the union line of thought. If the truth be known, I would imagine many workers would like to be able to have their own opinion about the people they would vote for. I read several articles where union thugs were using tactics that caused extensive damage and some injuries, at campaign offices and party offices of the Republicans around the country. There were other articles of intimidation of workers who were undecided or had decided against unionization. If this is what unionization is all about, then unions can just go away. Granted, there has to be a way of getting the corporations and companies to cooperate and work with employees, but if it means having to put up with thugs and slugs from a union and their dangerous and illegal activities; looking for some other way would be better.

        "quote": "Originally posted by greywolfghost: I wonder what wages and standard of living would look like in America without Unions? My first job out of the Army was as a welder's helper in a non-union shop in an anti-union state. I had a wife and kid at the time. The wage was $1.50 an hour. I moved up pretty quickly to lead welder, because of skills I'd learned from my father (an AFL-CIO man), and was paid $4.00 and hour - - Could you live on that? Unions can be corrupted, just like anything else, but organization and job action in the hands of the workers themselves is the only hedge against wage slavery...", 
        "reply": " I wonder how much of our manufacturing base we would still have in America, if unions hadn't put the cost of a company's product out of reach? Unions have pushed up the wages in many companies, but the companies can no longer compete with the world market. People will look for the bargain if given a choice. I personally would like to buy only American- made products, but many of the products that are American-made are expensive due to union action. I have to purchase things based on my ability to pay for them and that goes for many in this country. I buy American-made cars, from union-run factories and the cars are okay, but they don't stack up to some foreign cars that are built here in America or overseas. Is there a difference in the way these factories are run? I hear that the pride of workmanship is different in the foreign companies. American union members have gotten the idea that they can do a crappy job, because the union will cover their butt and I have personally seen this happen as a non-union worker in a shop that had a couple of union groups. There are numerous instances of unions causing such a fuss over a prospective firing, that the company just capitulated. What good does this kind of action do? The teacher's unions in many states have put an umbrella over poor performing teachers for years and that is why a lousy teacher stays on to continue doing a lousy job. Because of this, our kids suffer. The postal unions keep lousy workers from getting canned and we have to put up with lousy mail service. I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack over this, but I don't think unions are all that great. There is a lot of corruption, coercion, kick backs, bribes, and other illegal activity that makes unions very unappealling. If they could clean up their acts and do away with the strong-arm tactics, they might be useful tools for worker welfare. Stories abound about how unions, and their bosses and officers blow huge amounts of money on lavish \"conventions\" and such. Lots of stories about boozing, sleeping around, gambling, and who knows what else, and all on the backs of the union members and the dues they pay. Unions spend huge amounts to influence campaigns and \"punish\" workers who have a different opinion from the union line of thought. If the truth be known, I would imagine many workers would like to be able to have their own opinion about the people they would vote for. I read several articles where union thugs were using tactics that caused extensive damage and some injuries, at campaign offices and party offices of the Republicans around the country.

The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 47% of union members hold that view while only 18% disagree. But those who don\u2019t belong to a union hold a different perspective. By a 56% to 14% margin, they believe that most workers do not want to belong to a union. As for personal preference, only nine percent (9%) of non-union workers would like to join a union. Eighty-one percent (81%) would not. Even among those who are worried about losing their jobs in the near future, only nine percent (9%) would like to join a union. There is also no difference in a desire for union membership between those whose firms are hiring and those who are laying people off. Employees of firms with fewer than 50 employees are less likely to belong to a union and less likely to be interested in a union. All together, 24% of workers either belong to a union or would like to do so. At the same time, 59% of workers belong to the investor class and own at least $5,000 worth of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For those who see unions as one side in a battle between labor and management, it\u2019s worth noting that most union members have a foot in each camp: 54% of union members also belong to the investor class. Government employees are far more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. They are also less likely to be investors. Forty-one percent (41%) of those on the public payroll belong to a union while 42% are investors. Among private sector employees, just 11% belong to a union while 68% are investors. As for entrepreneurs, eight percent (8%) belong to a union, and 56% invest in companies other than just their own. Government employees are far more likely to believe that most workers want to belong to a union. Thirty-five percent (35%) of government employees hold this view, while 33% disagree and 32% are not sure. Among those who work in the private sector, just 16% believe most workers want to belong to a union while 53% disagree. Among non-union workers who make less than $40,000 annually, 16% would like to belong to a union. Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans and politically unaffiliated workers to belong to a union. Democrats who do not belong to a union are also far more likely than others to want union membership. By a 34% to 27% margin, Democrats believe that most workers want to belong to a union. However, 40% of those in President Obama\u2019s party are not sure. Sixty-one percent (61%) of Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe most workers want to be unionized, a view shared by the plurality (49%) of adults not affiliated with either party. In a survey in September, 55% of Americans had at least also a somewhat favorable opinion of labor unions, including 19% with a Very Favorable view. Thirty-five percent (35%) held a negative view of unions. <edit>",

By a 56% to 14% margin, they believe that most workers do not want to belong to a union. As for personal preference, only nine percent (9%) of non-union workers would like to join a union. Eighty-one percent (81%) would not. Even among those who are worried about losing their jobs in the near future, only nine percent (9%) would like to join a union. There is also no difference in a desire for union membership between those whose firms are hiring and those who are laying people off. Employees of firms with fewer than 50 employees are less likely to belong to a union and less likely to be interested in a union. All together, 24% of workers either belong to a union or would like to do so. At the same time, 59% of workers belong to the investor class and own at least $5,000 worth of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For those who see unions as one side in a battle between labor and management, it\u2019s worth noting that most union members have a foot in each camp: 54% of union members also belong to the investor class. Government employees are far more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. They are also less likely to be investors. Forty-one percent (41%) of those on the public payroll belong to a union while 42% are investors. Among private sector employees, just 11% belong to a union while 68% are investors. As for entrepreneurs, eight percent (8%) belong to a union, and 56% invest in companies other than just their own. Government employees are far more likely to believe that most workers want to belong to a union. Thirty-five percent (35%) of government employees hold this view, while 33% disagree and 32% are not sure. Among those who work in the private sector, just 16% believe most workers want to belong to a union while 53% disagree. Among non-union workers who make less than $40,000 annually, 16% would like to belong to a union. Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans and politically unaffiliated workers to belong to a union. Democrats who do not belong to a union are also far more likely than others to want union membership. By a 34% to 27% margin, Democrats believe that most workers want to belong to a union. However, 40% of those in President Obama\u2019s party are not sure. Sixty-one percent (61%) of Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe most workers want to be unionized, a view shared by the plurality (49%) of adults not affiliated with either party. In a survey in September, 55% of Americans had at least also a somewhat favorable opinion of labor unions, including 19% with a Very Favorable view. Thirty-five percent (35%) held a negative view of unions. <edit>",

I wonder how much of our manufacturing base we would still have in America, if unions hadn't put the cost of a company's product out of reach? Unions have pushed up the wages in many companies, but the companies can no longer compete with the world market. People will look for the bargain if given a choice. I personally would like to buy only American- made products, but many of the products that are American-made are expensive due to union action. I have to purchase things based on my ability to pay for them and that goes for many in this country. I buy American-made cars, from union-run factories and the cars are okay, but they don't stack up to some foreign cars that are built here in America or overseas. Is there a difference in the way these factories are run? I hear that the pride of workmanship is different in the foreign companies. American union members have gotten the idea that they can do a crappy job, because the union will cover their butt and I have personally seen this happen as a non-union worker in a shop that had a couple of union groups. There are numerous instances of unions causing such a fuss over a prospective firing, that the company just capitulated. What good does this kind of action do? The teacher's unions in many states have put an umbrella over poor performing teachers for years and that is why a lousy teacher stays on to continue doing a lousy job. Because of this, our kids suffer. The postal unions keep lousy workers from getting canned and we have to put up with lousy mail service. I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack over this, but I don't think unions are all that great. There is a lot of corruption, coercion, kick backs, bribes, and other illegal activity that makes unions very unappealling. If they could clean up their acts and do away with the strong-arm tactics, they might be useful tools for worker welfare. Stories abound about how unions, and their bosses and officers blow huge amounts of money on lavish \"conventions\" and such. Lots of stories about boozing, sleeping around, gambling, and who knows what else, and all on the backs of the union members and the dues they pay. Unions spend huge amounts to influence campaigns and \"punish\" workers who have a different opinion from the union line of thought. If the truth be known, I would imagine many workers would like to be able to have their own opinion about the people they would vote for. I read several articles where union thugs were using tactics that caused extensive damage and some injuries, at campaign offices and party offices of the Republicans around the country. There were other articles of intimidation of workers who were undecided or had decided against unionization. If this is what unionization is all about, then unions can just go away. Granted, there has to be a way of getting the corporations and companies to cooperate and work with employees, but if it means having to put up with thugs and slugs from a union and their dangerous and illegal activities; looking for some other way would be better. Unions may just be dinosaurs that need to die off. Some more modern form of binding arbitration may be in the future of workers and that might be better for all.",

I buy American-made cars, from union-run factories and the cars are okay, but they don't stack up to some foreign cars that are built here in America or overseas. Is there a difference in the way these factories are run? I hear that the pride of workmanship is different in the foreign companies. American union members have gotten the idea that they can do a crappy job, because the union will cover their butt and I have personally seen this happen as a non-union worker in a shop that had a couple of union groups. There are numerous instances of unions causing such a fuss over a prospective firing, that the company just capitulated. What good does this kind of action do? The teacher's unions in many states have put an umbrella over poor performing teachers for years and that is why a lousy teacher stays on to continue doing a lousy job. Because of this, our kids suffer. The postal unions keep lousy workers from getting canned and we have to put up with lousy mail service. I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack over this, but I don't think unions are all that great. There is a lot of corruption, coercion, kick backs, bribes, and other illegal activity that makes unions very unappealling. If they could clean up their acts and do away with the strong-arm tactics, they might be useful tools for worker welfare. Stories abound about how unions, and their bosses and officers blow huge amounts of money on lavish \"conventions\" and such. Lots of stories about boozing, sleeping around, gambling, and who knows what else, and all on the backs of the union members and the dues they pay. Unions spend huge amounts to influence campaigns and \"punish\" workers who have a different opinion from the union line of thought. If the truth be known, I would imagine many workers would like to be able to have their own opinion about the people they would vote for. I read several articles where union thugs were using tactics that caused extensive damage and some injuries, at campaign offices and party offices of the Republicans around the country. There were other articles of intimidation of workers who were undecided or had decided against unionization. If this is what unionization is all about, then unions can just go away. Granted, there has to be a way of getting the corporations and companies to cooperate and work with employees, but if it means having to put up with thugs and slugs from a union and their dangerous and illegal activities; looking for some other way would be better. Unions may just be dinosaurs that need to die off. Some more modern form of binding arbitration may be in the future of workers and that might be better for all.",

The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 47% of union members hold that view while only 18% disagree. But those who don\u2019t belong to a union hold a different perspective. By a 56% to 14% margin, they believe that most workers do not want to belong to a union. As for personal preference, only nine percent (9%) of non-union workers would like to join a union. Eighty-one percent (81%) would not. Even among those who are worried about losing their jobs in the near future, only nine percent (9%) would like to join a union. There is also no difference in a desire for union membership between those whose firms are hiring and those who are laying people off. Employees of firms with fewer than 50 employees are less likely to belong to a union and less likely to be interested in a union. All together, 24% of workers either belong to a union or would like to do so. At the same time, 59% of workers belong to the investor class and own at least $5,000 worth of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For those who see unions as one side in a battle between labor and management, it\u2019s worth noting that most union members have a foot in each camp: 54% of union members also belong to the investor class. Government employees are far more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. They are also less likely to be investors. Forty-one percent (41%) of those on the public payroll belong to a union while 42% are investors. Among private sector employees, just 11% belong to a union while 68% are investors. As for entrepreneurs, eight percent (8%) belong to a union, and 56% invest in companies other than just their own. Government employees are far more likely to believe that most workers want to belong to a union. Thirty-five percent (35%) of government employees hold this view, while 33% disagree and 32% are not sure. Among those who work in the private sector, just 16% believe most workers want to belong to a union while 53% disagree. Among non-union workers who make less than $40,000 annually, 16% would like to belong to a union. Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans and politically unaffiliated workers to belong to a union. Democrats who do not belong to a union are also far more likely than others to want union membership. By a 34% to 27% margin, Democrats believe that most workers want to belong to a union. However, 40% of those in President Obama\u2019s party are not sure. Sixty-one percent (61%) of Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe most workers want to be unionized, a view shared by the plurality (49%) of adults not affiliated with either party. In a survey in September, 55% of Americans had at least also a somewhat favorable opinion of labor unions, including 19% with a Very Favorable view. Thirty-five percent (35%) held a negative view of unions. <edit>",

Among non-union workers who make less than $40,000 annually, 16% would like to belong to a union. Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans and politically unaffiliated workers to belong to a union. Democrats who do not belong to a union are also far more likely than others to want union membership. By a 34% to 27% margin, Democrats believe that most workers want to belong to a union. However, 40% of those in President Obama\u2019s party are not sure. Sixty-one percent (61%) of Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe most workers want to be unionized, a view shared by the plurality (49%) of adults not affiliated with either party. In a survey in September, 55% of Americans had at least also a somewhat favorable opinion of labor unions, including 19% with a Very Favorable view. Thirty-five percent (35%) held a negative view of unions. <edit>",

Unions have pushed up the wages in many companies, but the companies can no longer compete with the world market. People will look for the bargain if given a choice. I personally would like to buy only American- made products, but many of the products that are American-made are expensive due to union action. I have to purchase things based on my ability to pay for them and that goes for many in this country. I buy American-made cars, from union-run factories and the cars are okay, but they don't stack up to some foreign cars that are built here in America or overseas. Is there a difference in the way these factories are run? I hear that the pride of workmanship is different in the foreign companies. American union members have gotten the idea that they can do a crappy job, because the union will cover their butt and I have personally seen this happen as a non-union worker in a shop that had a couple of union groups. There are numerous instances of unions causing such a fuss over a prospective firing, that the company just capitulated. What good does this kind of action do? The teacher's unions in many states have put an umbrella over poor performing teachers for years and that is why a lousy teacher stays on to continue doing a lousy job. Because of this, our kids suffer. The postal unions keep lousy workers from getting canned and we have to put up with lousy mail service. I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack over this, but I don't think unions are all that great. There is a lot of corruption, coercion, kick backs, bribes, and other illegal activity that makes unions very unappealling. If they could clean up their acts and do away with the strong-arm tactics, they might be useful tools for worker welfare. Stories abound about how unions, and their bosses and officers blow huge amounts of money on lavish \"conventions\" and such. Lots of stories about boozing, sleeping around, gambling, and who knows what else, and all on the backs of the union members and the dues they pay. Unions spend huge amounts to influence campaigns and \"punish\" workers who have a different opinion from the union line of thought. If the truth be known, I would imagine many workers would like to be able to have their own opinion about the people they would vote for. I read several articles where union thugs were using tactics that caused extensive damage and some injuries, at campaign offices and party offices of the Republicans around the country. There were other articles of intimidation of workers who were undecided or had decided against unionization. If this is what unionization is all about, then unions can just go away. Granted, there has to be a way of getting the corporations and companies to cooperate and work with employees, but if it means having to put up with thugs and slugs from a union and their dangerous and illegal activities; looking for some other way would be better. Unions may just be dinosaurs that need to die off. Some more modern form of binding arbitration may be in the future of workers and that might be better for all.",

Granted, there has to be a way of getting the corporations and companies to cooperate and work with employees, but if it means having to put up with thugs and slugs from a union and their dangerous and illegal activities; looking for some other way would be better. Unions may just be dinosaurs that need to die off. Some more modern form of binding arbitration may be in the future of workers and that might be better for all.",

Next thing you know (after citations and fines), the place got cleaned up and lit up, danger lines got painted and flash shields appeared between welding stations, shielding and safety guards got put in, restrooms got cleaned up and rebuilt so the toilets would flush, break rooms got cleaned up and filled with decent furniture to eat your lunch - in general, the dungeon quality of the place got replaced by a little bit of the 20th Century.
