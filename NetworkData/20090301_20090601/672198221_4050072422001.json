In doing so, he changed a war. What would continue of that Civil War would be grim, lacking the hyperbole of patriotic huzzahs and the dash and colour of untried militias.

Gratitude implies a continuing gratefulness on the part of the American public and I'm not sure that exists or can exist. Perhaps it is too much to ask of a busy and now troubled (by the recession) people that they be grateful for a soldier's sacrifice. I've always believed anyway that the public shows its appreciation when Congress and the Administration provide adequate benefits to veterans of America's wars -- and by that I mean support for the VA so that permanently disabled vets are appropriately cared for too. The war dead, like all dead, are gone forever. We can't do anything more for them except to care for their graves.",
