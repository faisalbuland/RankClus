Yesterday the Czech PM deferred a vote on the agreement for fear his government was going to lose it. If President Obama is on-side, it looks like some 'pump priming' will need to be done to ensure legislative support for the two required votes on the treaty. The Czechs reading Kim Jong Il's book on getting what you want?",

They saw that we did not react when Russia invaded Georgia, that we could not react, that getting involved in an armed conflict with nuclear-armed Russia over a small (and non-allied) country is pretty much the last thing our military needs to do right now. We would do it, if we had to, but the threshold for action is very very high. Given all of the above, it would behoove the Czech Republic to take it slow. Right now, there's negotiations behind the scenes between the U.S. and Russia on the future of missile defense on the continent. It would be prudent to wait to see how that works out, rather than unnecessarily riling up Russia.",
