        "content": "While admitting that it is not possible to keep American completely safe from another attack by radical extremists, be they Muslim or even home grown nuts like Timothy McVeigh, the Bush Administration worked to diminish the chance of another attack. Unfortunately, in their zeal to keep Americans safe from another attack, they decided that it was necessary to go around or ignore many of the rights and ideals that Americans have fought and died for \u2013 in the name of keeping us safe. According to Dick Cheney, to be safer, all we have to do is give government officials the power to make decisions and take actions that will keep us safe, such as: Allow the government to invade the privacy of every American, be it the unrestricted monitoring email and phone calls, creating data bases of shopping and travel habits or keeping watch on the minute details of every American\u2019s life like what library books they check out. Allow the government to restrict travel of Americans and foreign nationals by expanding the no-fly list \u2013 a list that is established by some government official, based on the information gathered in government databases. Allow the government to round up the usual suspects, including American citizens when they see fit \u2013 based on the decision of some government official who has seen the details gathered about individuals from the data that the government is allowed to gather. Allow the government to keep people in detention based on the decision of the President of the United States or some other government official, without oversight of the courts of the legislature. Allow government officials to hire contractors to question prisoners with techniques that are considered illegal by civilized nations (including this one), if a government official sees fit to do so. Fortunately the system worked. In each case the courts, the legislature and the will of the American people worked to turn back the erosion of our rights that the Bush/Cheney Administration tried to impose on us, keeping those rules that work within the ideals of who we are as Americans. Now the Obama Administration will try and impose government regulations on business and everyday life of Americans. They will tell us that they know what kind of cars we should drive and when we should go to the doctor and how to build a house that is green. These regulations will also be pushed back, keeping what really does work. Hopefully, the next government we elect (or the one after that \u2013 these things take time) will be somewhere between that of Bush and Obama, and America will be the better for having been through the extremes of the left and the right. That is how American system works - in the long run, American is a better place, even if extremes take hold from time to time. There is always much to be proud about this country. Memorial Day makes it a great day to say out loud, God I love this country.",
