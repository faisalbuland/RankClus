Fox will be alerting viewers with an onscreen graphic at the top of the 8:00 PM (ET) hour that the press conference is available on Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network.\" While on the topic of Fox News and Obama think back to the presidential primaries. Bill OReilly went through hell to get Obama to appear on The Factor. Eventually, Obama did appear on the show where Bill treated the man with the utmost respect. \"So? I rejected Faux News years ago. No biggy.\" Wow CJ! This must be the first time TODAY you mentioned you don't like FOX NEWS. I began to suspect something in your last 1,367 Anti-Fox posts....",
