Israel is far from stupid; the Arab world has often underestimated Israel's ability. The Persian leadership in Iran has watched tiny Israel defeat its Arab neighbors in war after war so I doubt that the leadership in Iran is either complacent, or overly confident. Expecting an Israeli attack on Iran to fail ignores history. Jack I bet the ONLY thing holding Israel back is US and our troops in the area. If we had not been in the way, it would have been done, over and forgotten about already ..a long time ago. Israel does not fear war but they do respect it. nor do they take threats lightly as long as they know they are real and not just talk.",

As I am doing with other future events, I will put a date of on or near October 26, 2009 for when Israel will attack Iran. It is quite clear from both their rhetoric and their military actions of the past few months that they are preparing for an invasion. You don't have massive military drills preparing for an all out regional war coupled with harsh words about your enemy without some foreknowledge. Sure you do its called Sabre rattling and high stakes bluffing. But they wont step off unless they are assured the US will back them 100%. I dont believe Obama will give them that assurance or confidence and hence they wont. If they do go it alone they will be in for a surprise I believe and will turn the whole arab world focus against them. The US will have no choice but to back up its best allie in the region if they go it alone...simple as that.",

Never forget, there is more than 1 way to skin a cat, Israel is NOT stupid. tic toc...tic...toc.. It's still only.... CJ, Well said. Israel is far from stupid; the Arab world has often underestimated Israel's ability. The Persian leadership in Iran has watched tiny Israel defeat its Arab neighbors in war after war so I doubt that the leadership in Iran is either complacent, or overly confident. Expecting an Israeli attack on Iran to fail ignores history. Jack I bet the ONLY thing holding Israel back is US and our troops in the area. If we had not been in the way, it would have been done, over and forgotten about already ..a long time ago. Israel does not fear war but they do respect it. nor do they take threats lightly as long as they know they are real and not just talk.",
