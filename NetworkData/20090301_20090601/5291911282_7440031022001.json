I love the opinions and ideas you all have here; I am single, currently in college working on a master degree, I like listening to music, some kinds more than others. That's pretty much it. I really appreciate participating in your forum and will start my posting with this important hidden information for majority of people. Below you will see the prohibited photos in the west: Israeli children sign their missiles 'With Love' Please be warned that some of these pictures are graphic and disturbing We shouldn\u2019t allow the media to deceive us. I will not let them have it their way\u2026 This is my role now. We must help humanity and show links to many. The Other Side of the Story: You will not believe your eyes Spread the word, tell the world the truth! Don't let them have it their way\u2026", 
        "reply": " So Sara, who are you and what are you up to? How would we know if you are not faking everything you are claiming here? There have been examples of Hamas trying to rebuild Soviet style tanks to look like Israeli tanks, so whatever atrocities they use the faked-up tanks for will be blamed on Israel. Our news services are more free than just about any on the planet to show what they wish... So why should we believe a totally anonymous poster like you instead of the variety of them??? By the way, Mods, the profile of this poster, or lack of it, shows exactly what is wrong with the new less than \"Public Profile\" page - - Hama T-55 faked up to look like Israeli Merkava. The give-away is the roadwheels (Style and Spacing): Wandering and Wondering",
