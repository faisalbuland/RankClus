He would bring fresh ideas to Washington, Wall Street and Main Street, and get us out of our money troubles. When he was eventually elected, he told us for weeks that it was imperative and urgent that we pass his stimulus package, lest America crumble into ruins and take Rome\u2019s spot atop the list of \u201cBest Ancient Empires\u201d to visit on vacation. The bill was rushed through Congress and promptly signed into action, much to the relief of\u2026 well, no one, really. But as the stock market continues to sputter, joblessness continues to rise, entire industries continue to wane, and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner runs around Washington hoping to find his staff, the Obama administration wants us to rest assured \u2014 it is hard at work convincing Congress to\u2026lengthen the school day. In defense of redirecting his attention to stem cell research, GITMO, \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d abortion legislation and other non-essentials totally and utterly unrelated to fixing the economy, President Obama told us that John F. Kennedy didn\u2019t choose between Civil Rights and going to the moon. True \u2014 but getting Neil Armstrong some moon rocks was not a national emergency. Had the United States economy been \u201cthe worst since the Great Depression\u201d (cue scary music), I\u2019m fairly certain Kennedy would have spent the $100 billion it cost to land on the moon on fixing the deficit. Is the economy so dire that we need to spend trillions \u2014 now! hurry up! \u2014 of taxpayer money to fix it? Or can we afford to take a little time and make sure we\u2019re making the right decisions? It can\u2019t be both. And so in honor of President Obama\u2019s penchant for multi-tasking at the worst possible time, the following is a list of the top 10 things he could also work on, on the side, while fixing the economy: 1. Do we know definitively how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop? 2. Alitalia loses luggage like Drew Peterson loses wives. They need to be punished. Severely. 3. I was promised flying cars at some point in the new millennium. 4. Update Great Britain\u2019s official DVD collection\u2026oh, wait, never mind. 5. I hear the upstairs bathroom outside the Lincoln Bedroom is a pigsty. 6. Put a ShamWow, Chop Slap, and the Snuggie, that wizard-like blanket with sleeves, in every household across the country. 7. Stop neglecting Facebook page and Twitter \u2014 keep those presidential status updates fresh. 8. Take advantage of tanking airline industry, and go on that long overdue second honeymoon with Sandals Royal Bahamian all-inclusive \u201cRomance Package.\u201d 9. Pen second autobiography. 10.
