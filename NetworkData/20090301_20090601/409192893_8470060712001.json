What happened was that private money from investors stopped coming in for lending purposes as easily as it had been. Investors got jittery. And that's actually the reason the government is interfering, to provide enough assurances for private investors, so that their money comes back in and is used to lend again. It has really little to do with investment bankers or banks - those are just a conduit linking supply and demand. Gov't assurances to fix the problem are not for the benefit of homeowners - they are for the benefit of private investors. Homeowners en masse actually need very few assurances. Demand is easily created; people are eager to borrow. A lot of men making 50k a year will not hesitate on a loan of 350k with a monthly pymnt of 2,000. Chances are he won't be much thinking about the million + he'll have paid back by the time it's all said and done, and more if he refinances. So with decisions like that, homeowners don't need assurances. If someone is willing to lend, people will be willing to borrow. The key is convincing private investors that people actually have enough money to pay their mortgage, so money can be lent again. Asset bubbles will come again. This message has been edited.
