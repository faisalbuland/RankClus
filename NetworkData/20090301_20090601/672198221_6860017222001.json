Does ANYONE ever wonder why? Or HOW or WHERE the Obama administration gets this number from on such a variety of different things? 90% of Mexicos illegal guns come from the USA. 90% of the drugs come across the border. How about 90% of the politicians both North and South of the border are as crooked and self serving as each other. Now THAT'S a statistic that everyone can believe.",

This crap that over 90% of the weapons the cartels have come from the USA is bogus. Since when do we sell fully automatic AK-47's? Now we know this administration is a \"Thugocracy\" criminal cartel. Hell the head of it sold Cocaine as a teen in Hawaii. So why would he do any thing to block his favorite recreational drug from flowing in to the country? Yea, I am calling Scumbama, I refuse to use his name, a criminal. He has them in his administration, backs them on the streets and should be with them in a prison.",

What a Load of \"crapola\" in an effort to help the Mexican Army combat these Narco-Terrorists The Pentagon and DoD sent 400 million dollars worth of weapon buying power to the Mexican Military, M-4's fully auto/select-fire, grenades like the Fragmentation and flash-bangs, Remington Sniper rifles,etc and most of the AWOL Mexican GI's now work with the Narco-Traffickers = more money and they then bring their issue weapons along for the ride! This is tantamount to Treason in so far as I am concerned. When the Govt. is afraid of it's citizens owning firearms this is the kind of tyranny that our Founding Fathers spoke of, when they crafted the 2nd Amendment The Right To KABA! Obamanation is what I call the anti-gunners. They want now to register every weapon in every house-hold, and stop folks from reloading their own ammo! Calling Patriots and current serving Military combatants potential Domestic Terrorists, is beyond the pale! I say come and Take IT! But be ready to Face the Wrath of the common American Patriot, shame upon whoever takes an Order to fire on the citizens and obeys! Nuff said! In Freedom and Liberty, DocNBear",
