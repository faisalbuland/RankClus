Oh, my bad - they were democrats. Nixon and Reagan hammered the Contstitution. In any case I discount your \"demorcat\" examples for lack of specifcity. Walt As i said, I am waffling on this one for now. Specifics? Johnson and McNamara (by McNamara's own admission) allowed the story of North Vietnamese gunboat attacks on the USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy to perpetuate and even encouraged them when they knew it to be untrue and used the incident(s) as an excuse to start sending combat troops to SEA. FDR covered up training accidents like the one for D-Day that was ambushed by German E-boats and resulted in hundreds of casualties and the USS Indianapolis sinking and US breaking neutrality to support Great Britain in late 30s early 40s. May have had good reason, but still did it. Senator Clinton had declared to know nothing of certain financial transactions during the Whitewater investigation despite files to the contrary turning up in her office with her fingerprints on them. And doesn't the Vince Foster suicide seem a little coincindental? Discout all you want, but the incidents did happen. Ignoring them doesn't change anything. I am not excusing anything Presidents Reagan or Nixon may or may not have done. It just seems that 'irregularities' by Democrats get overlooked when recent US history is discussed. If we are going to throw cards on the table, then it should be the whole deck, not just the suite you like.",

        "reply": " As i said, I am waffling on this one for now. Specifics? Johnson and McNamara (by McNamara's own admission) allowed the story of North Vietnamese gunboat attacks on the USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy to perpetuate and even encouraged them when they knew it to be untrue and used the incident(s) as an excuse to start sending combat troops to SEA. FDR covered up training accidents like the one for D-Day that was ambushed by German E-boats and resulted in hundreds of casualties and the USS Indianapolis sinking and US breaking neutrality to support Great Britain in late 30s early 40s. May have had good reason, but still did it. Senator Clinton had declared to know nothing of certain financial transactions during the Whitewater investigation despite files to the contrary turning up in her office with her fingerprints on them. And doesn't the Vince Foster suicide seem a little coincindental? Discout all you want, but the incidents did happen. Ignoring them doesn't change anything.

Torture runs against all the principles our country was founded on, and indeed runs against all the principles Christianity was founded on. It is time to look at it for what it is. Torture does not accomplish anything. It only makes matters worse. Even worse yet, it is a completely un-American, and un-Christian thing to do. I think we should call it for what it is. It has no basis in morality, or freedom, or intelligence. It is simply revenge and brings us down to the un-Enlightened level of those we seek to defeat. Now, I have given up on the folks who did this ever being brought to justice. Such people always seem to be able to walk between the raindrops.

I think it is very likely a relief to him he has not a grave to roll over in. I think it all boils down to whether Americans want us to be an Enlightened, rule of law society or not. Enlightened peoples simply do not torture their fellow man. Christian peoples don't either. Torture runs against all the principles our country was founded on, and indeed runs against all the principles Christianity was founded on. It is time to look at it for what it is. Torture does not accomplish anything. It only makes matters worse. Even worse yet, it is a completely un-American, and un-Christian thing to do. I think we should call it for what it is. It has no basis in morality, or freedom, or intelligence. It is simply revenge and brings us down to the un-Enlightened level of those we seek to defeat. Now, I have given up on the folks who did this ever being brought to justice. Such people always seem to be able to walk between the raindrops. However, if this mistake can be used to create a public uproar to make sure that America never again drags itself down to such an un-Enlightened level I will consider it the only accomplishment of the Bush Administration.\" >http://www.hillbillyreport.org/diary/72/torture-debate-quite-troubling<",

FDR covered up training accidents like the one for D-Day that was ambushed by German E-boats and resulted in hundreds of casualties and the USS Indianapolis sinking and US breaking neutrality to support Great Britain in late 30s early 40s. May have had good reason, but still did it. Senator Clinton had declared to know nothing of certain financial transactions during the Whitewater investigation despite files to the contrary turning up in her office with her fingerprints on them. And doesn't the Vince Foster suicide seem a little coincindental? Discout all you want, but the incidents did happen. Ignoring them doesn't change anything. I am not excusing anything Presidents Reagan or Nixon may or may not have done. It just seems that 'irregularities' by Democrats get overlooked when recent US history is discussed.

FDR covered up training accidents like the one for D-Day that was ambushed by German E-boats and resulted in hundreds of casualties and the USS Indianapolis sinking and US breaking neutrality to support Great Britain in late 30s early 40s. May have had good reason, but still did it. Senator Clinton had declared to know nothing of certain financial transactions during the Whitewater investigation despite files to the contrary turning up in her office with her fingerprints on them. And doesn't the Vince Foster suicide seem a little coincindental? Discout all you want, but the incidents did happen. Ignoring them doesn't change anything.

May have had good reason, but still did it. Senator Clinton had declared to know nothing of certain financial transactions during the Whitewater investigation despite files to the contrary turning up in her office with her fingerprints on them. And doesn't the Vince Foster suicide seem a little coincindental? Discout all you want, but the incidents did happen. Ignoring them doesn't change anything.
