I was renting a single-family home from a guy who turned out to be a financial idiot. He bought the house to flip it, didn't repair it right, and turns out he was financially in the hole with it, and that turned into him trying to practically pawn the house off on us. Well, with the deficiencies in the property, and the fact that we discovered he hadn't gotten the landlord permits, we got out of our lease. Now we're renting a new house from a small business owned by two brothers who build nice houses and rent them out. We're lucky - they own the house, and nobody is going to foreclose on them. We might even buy it from them because we like the property so much. But if we'd stayed with that first knucklehead... I'll bet he's about ready to go under by now. I feel bad for the young ladies who are currently renting from him. Stuff like this sucks, because the actual RESIDENTS - the tenants - don't own the house, don't control the mortgage, and are probably paying all their bills on time, but can end up kicked out of their homes because the landlord is an idiot. It's not fair to the tenants, but it's becoming more common. A tragedy of the housing market that is going on under the radar. What protects these tenants?",

Agreed, I am hearing more and more of the same story. A lot of folks that rented houses were not aware their landlords were not paying the mortgages. Next thing they knew they were being evicted by the lenders, regardless if they were paying their rent on time. There has to be a way to stop this before it gets worse.
