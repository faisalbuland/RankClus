The adults know that children will not recieve as stiff a sentance as they themselves would. We now have gang members 16 years and younger going out rapeing other children and killing them. Wake up the kids DO know what they are doing, They DO KNOW it is wrong, but they also know they can get away with it because \"they are poor, misstreated little angels\" I have watched the news and lived in the world a long time I have seen how these gang members here in the U.S. work, I have known of fellow officers that were killed just so the 13 year old gang member could get his badge and show the other gang members how good he was, the (13 year old was tried as a youthful offender and only served 4-5 years). These little angels Know what they are doing and know most people will let them get away with it. Again guess I'm just getting old and my give-a-damm got busted along time ago, and yes the good humer man has left the building. MO D.J. to the moderators sorry this is probably in the wrong disscussion, I just dont know how to move it to point counterpoint if that is where it belongs. D.J.",
