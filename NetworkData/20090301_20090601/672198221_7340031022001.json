Most people, unless they were former members of the Guard, thought that the Guard was nothing more than an excuse for former active duty troops to get together on the weekends and drink beer and talk about the \"good ole days\"...

People like you just ruin anything nice that people try to do for military families because you always complain that it's not enough. I agree with Disney, you should be on active duty status to use their offer, there are many service members that have never been deployed that are in the reserves. To bad your husband is a reservist, they still get my respect for all they do, but that's the breaks, if you don't like it, why don't you join the active duty service instead of complaining about what you didn't get or better yet, how about you do something nice for a reservist other than your spouse? Businesses don't have to do anything, it's nice that some have decided to do these things at all, especially in our current economy. It costs them alot of money do make these offers, and believe me, all of the greediest military families make sure they use all discounts and offers they get whether they really deserve them or not, they even complain about discounts they can't get or aren't offered. You know, the government does a decent job of providing good pay, housing money, medical benefits for us families, we aren't all poverty, unless you make bad financial choices or choose to have 4 or 5 kids, then sure you can't make it on one person's pay, those families should have 2 working spouses after all, they made the choices that put them there. I hate people like you, and sadly there are many more spouses just like you in the military, active duty or not. Civilians that do great things everyday to help in our country don't get these offers, many should, but that's business, it's about making a profit. Hell they even give everyone a free admission on their birthday, what more can you complains about? Maybe you should just write Disney and tell them, Hey it's all of us or none of us, being sarcastic incase you missed it. Didn't you learn in pre-k that lifes not fair all of the time?

Like I said, it's their program, and they can give it to whomever they like. And if a Reservist is serving overseas, then they are \"active\" and eligible for the discount, so your argument is completely moot. However, I do take issue with you saying that active-duty spouses don't \"do anything.\" We give up our jobs and spend money on a move every time our servicmembers PCS. We hold down our homes while our servicemembers are deployed. We comfort our children when they have to leave their friends and their school and their home at the drop of a hat. That doesn't give us an excuse to wear our spouse's rank (and I'm not excusing those who do), but it's certainly a sacrifice and I appreciate when companies offer a discount as a token of their appreciation for that sacrifice. However, I also know that it's my sacrifice to make, and I'm doing so willingly, and nobody owes me anything for doing so. I would have gone to Disney this year even if there weren't a discount. I plan to take my kids there in a few years, even if they no longer have the program--I certainly won't complain and claim that I'm owed something. And if they do offer a discount, I will be sure to say \"Thank you.\" Argument is not moot. If they are only active when they are overseas, they cannot come back to the states just to go to Disney while on active. Once they get back they go back to reservist status. There are jobs at every fort and base so don't say you give up your jobs. You can always get one. Spouses choose not to work.

People like you just ruin anything nice that people try to do for military families because you always complain that it's not enough. I agree with Disney, you should be on active duty status to use their offer, there are many service members that have never been deployed that are in the reserves. To bad your husband is a reservist, they still get my respect for all they do, but that's the breaks, if you don't like it, why don't you join the active duty service instead of complaining about what you didn't get or better yet, how about you do something nice for a reservist other than your spouse? Businesses don't have to do anything, it's nice that some have decided to do these things at all, especially in our current economy. It costs them alot of money do make these offers, and believe me, all of the greediest military families make sure they use all discounts and offers they get whether they really deserve them or not, they even complain about discounts they can't get or aren't offered. You know, the government does a decent job of providing good pay, housing money, medical benefits for us families, we aren't all poverty, unless you make bad financial choices or choose to have 4 or 5 kids, then sure you can't make it on one person's pay, those families should have 2 working spouses after all, they made the choices that put them there. I hate people like you, and sadly there are many more spouses just like you in the military, active duty or not. Civilians that do great things everyday to help in our country don't get these offers, many should, but that's business, it's about making a profit. Hell they even give everyone a free admission on their birthday, what more can you complains about? Maybe you should just write Disney and tell them, Hey it's all of us or none of us, being sarcastic incase you missed it. Didn't you learn in pre-k that lifes not fair all of the time?

People like you just ruin anything nice that people try to do for military families because you always complain that it's not enough. I agree with Disney, you should be on active duty status to use their offer, there are many service members that have never been deployed that are in the reserves. To bad your husband is a reservist, they still get my respect for all they do, but that's the breaks, if you don't like it, why don't you join the active duty service instead of complaining about what you didn't get or better yet, how about you do something nice for a reservist other than your spouse? Businesses don't have to do anything, it's nice that some have decided to do these things at all, especially in our current economy. It costs them alot of money do make these offers, and believe me, all of the greediest military families make sure they use all discounts and offers they get whether they really deserve them or not, they even complain about discounts they can't get or aren't offered. You know, the government does a decent job of providing good pay, housing money, medical benefits for us families, we aren't all poverty, unless you make bad financial choices or choose to have 4 or 5 kids, then sure you can't make it on one person's pay, those families should have 2 working spouses after all, they made the choices that put them there. I hate people like you, and sadly there are many more spouses just like you in the military, active duty or not. Civilians that do great things everyday to help in our country don't get these offers, many should, but that's business, it's about making a profit. Hell they even give everyone a free admission on their birthday, what more can you complains about? Maybe you should just write Disney and tell them, Hey it's all of us or none of us, being sarcastic incase you missed it. Didn't you learn in pre-k that lifes not fair all of the time? You sound extremely GREEDY! This message has been edited. Last edited by: IndependentWife, Wed 08 April 2009 07:43 AM",

People like you just ruin anything nice that people try to do for military families because you always complain that it's not enough. I agree with Disney, you should be on active duty status to use their offer, there are many service members that have never been deployed that are in the reserves. To bad your husband is a reservist, they still get my respect for all they do, but that's the breaks, if you don't like it, why don't you join the active duty service instead of complaining about what you didn't get or better yet, how about you do something nice for a reservist other than your spouse? Businesses don't have to do anything, it's nice that some have decided to do these things at all, especially in our current economy. It costs them alot of money do make these offers, and believe me, all of the greediest military families make sure they use all discounts and offers they get whether they really deserve them or not, they even complain about discounts they can't get or aren't offered. You know, the government does a decent job of providing good pay, housing money, medical benefits for us families, we aren't all poverty, unless you make bad financial choices or choose to have 4 or 5 kids, then sure you can't make it on one person's pay, those families should have 2 working spouses after all, they made the choices that put them there. I hate people like you, and sadly there are many more spouses just like you in the military, active duty or not. Civilians that do great things everyday to help in our country don't get these offers, many should, but that's business, it's about making a profit. Hell they even give everyone a free admission on their birthday, what more can you complains about? Maybe you should just write Disney and tell them, Hey it's all of us or none of us, being sarcastic incase you missed it. Didn't you learn in pre-k that lifes not fair all of the time?

Currently have family in the Guard and another son was in the Guard.
