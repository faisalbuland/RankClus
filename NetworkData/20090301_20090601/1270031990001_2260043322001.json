(Genesis 18:1-5) That is not what Gen 18 says. The original text is in Hebrew and the word used to describe G-d is made of 4 letters. BTW, who are the sons of G-d mentioned in the same chapter. For Jesus to be the one talking to Abraham, the men (referred as sons of G-d) had to be the children of Jesus. How many childrend did Jesus had? Abraham was able to recognize Jesus immediately as is apparent by his actions of running toward Him, bowing and speaking \"my Lord\". Nah, that is not what happen. Genesis says that HaShem appeared to Abraham and THEN 3 MAN (anashim) showed up. So, who is the one that was already talking to Abraham at the begining of Gen 18? Furthermore, the word used in Gen 18 is adonay, which is used both to refer to G-d and man. The main difference is that Chapter 18 MAKES a difference by using the 4-letter Name and the word adonai. In addition, there were 3 man, not jus one. Abraham had met the Lord before (Genesis 12:7). The word used is AGAIN the 4-letter Name of G-d. Most Christians (that I have talked to) recognize HaShem with the first person of the Trinity. Jesus speaking of God the Father: \"No man hath seen God at any time\" (1 John 4:12) Moses did: Exodus 33:11 And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.\" Deut.34: 10 And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face;\" Since John says that nobody has seen G-d and the two books of the Torah says Moses did. Someone is lying. \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape\" (John 5:37) The whole congregation at Mt. Sinai did: Deut.4:33 Did ever a people hear the voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? So, Abraham had a very real, personal discussion with the person who would later be known as Jesus Christ. There is no scripture in the OT that indicates this event . BY the time Jesus was born, Abraham was already dead. So they never met. Abraham even called Jesus. \"the Judge of all the earth\" (Genesis 18:23-25) No, Jesus is not the Judge of the earth according to Gen 18:25 That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?' Jacob, later known as Israel, Abraham's grandson had an all night wrestling match with Jesus. Is Jesus an Angel too? In reality nobody knows the name of the man/angel that Jacob encountered: Gen 32: 30 And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there. The match went on for some time until the breaking of the day. Both were physically adept and the match was extremely close. Jacob's unkown wrestler touched part of his thigh which put it out of joint, but Jacob kept such an iron grasp that the mystery man asked to be freed. Jacob realized the man's true identity and then the man said \"Let me go, for it is dawn\". Jacob replied \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\" \"What is your name?\" the man asked. \"Jacob\" \"Your name will no longer be Jacob\" the man said. \"It is now Israel, because you have struggled with both God and men, and have won\". When Jacob gave a name to this venue, he named the place \"Peniel\" -\"face of God\" -for he said \"I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared\". Why did you skip the part where Jacob asked the name of the man? You know why the name of the man is not important? Because he is only an Angel, nothing else. The Old Testament is not about some grouchy, old \"God the father\", it's about Jesus. You mean the Christian OT? The Jewish Tanakh is all about the Torah of HaShem, Israel and the Nations. The term \"angel\", is found when Jesus appeared to Moses for the first time: \"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" He said to Moses: \"I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob\". (Exodus 3:2,6) An angel is MALACH. If Jesus is an Angel, then Jesus is a created being. Angels are not gods. Here, read the original text: \u05d1 \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0 \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5, \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05ea-\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1--\u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05da\u05b0 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4; \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05e0\u05bc\u05b5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4, \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e0\u05b6\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc. While the God of the Old Testament said \"I AM\" would be His name forever, Jesus was nearly stoned to death by the Jews for calling Himself \"I AM\". Yeah, in Judaism that is blasphemy. Since Jesus was a Jew according to the Torah, he had to be stoned. God was seen and heard many times in the Old Testament, who was it everyone in the Old Testament saw and heard? Not according to 1 John 4:12 and John 5:37, as you preciously pointed-out. Jesus is the same God who ordered light to shine from the very beginning, the same God who flooded the earth, the same God who used His finger to write the Ten Commandments into the stone tablets. No really. Unless you are talking about a different creation, commandments, etc. that are Christian in nature. In that case you may be right. So, let me ask you something, is there a Trinity? When Jesus talks about the Father, is he talking about himself? Is he his own father? This information really makes the Bible even more powerful for me. It completely bridges the meanings of the laws and proves the Bible maintains the consistent message it promises. Which laws? Could you explain them to us? It enlightens me to how our God operates and helps me understand the role of Jesus (although adds many questions) and shows even more that He was not merely a \"sacrifice\" (as many atheists like to say \"how could He murder his Son\") but an integral part neccessary for our understanding, because let's face it, we were created with great minds and it is an abomination to not attempt to understand the complexities of our Father. Who is the father, because according to Christian Theology Jesus is the Son. So where is the Bible is the Father mentioned? Ixcatzin This message has been edited.

Why did you skip the part where Jacob asked the name of the man? You know why the name of the man is not important? Because he is only an Angel, nothing else. The Old Testament is not about some grouchy, old \"God the father\", it's about Jesus. You mean the Christian OT? The Jewish Tanakh is all about the Torah of HaShem, Israel and the Nations. The term \"angel\", is found when Jesus appeared to Moses for the first time: \"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" He said to Moses: \"I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob\". (Exodus 3:2,6) An angel is MALACH. If Jesus is an Angel, then Jesus is a created being. Angels are not gods. Here, read the original text: \u05d1 \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0 \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5, \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05ea-\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1--\u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05da\u05b0 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4; \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05e0\u05bc\u05b5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4, \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e0\u05b6\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc. While the God of the Old Testament said \"I AM\" would be His name forever, Jesus was nearly stoned to death by the Jews for calling Himself \"I AM\". Yeah, in Judaism that is blasphemy. Since Jesus was a Jew according to the Torah, he had to be stoned. God was seen and heard many times in the Old Testament, who was it everyone in the Old Testament saw and heard? Not according to 1 John 4:12 and John 5:37, as you preciously pointed-out. Jesus is the same God who ordered light to shine from the very beginning, the same God who flooded the earth, the same God who used His finger to write the Ten Commandments into the stone tablets. No really. Unless you are talking about a different creation, commandments, etc. that are Christian in nature. In that case you may be right. So, let me ask you something, is there a Trinity? When Jesus talks about the Father, is he talking about himself? Is he his own father? This information really makes the Bible even more powerful for me. It completely bridges the meanings of the laws and proves the Bible maintains the consistent message it promises. Which laws? Could you explain them to us? It enlightens me to how our God operates and helps me understand the role of Jesus (although adds many questions) and shows even more that He was not merely a \"sacrifice\" (as many atheists like to say \"how could He murder his Son\") but an integral part neccessary for our understanding, because let's face it, we were created with great minds and it is an abomination to not attempt to understand the complexities of our Father. Who is the father, because according to Christian Theology Jesus is the Son. So where is the Bible is the Father mentioned?",

        "content": "quote: Originally posted by ixcatzin: quote: Originally posted by soscorpio: \"God the Father\" is not in the Torah. Because the concept of the Trinity is Christian and the Torah is Jewish. The scripture indicates that the Lord - Jesus, not God the Father appeared in the form of man before Abraham with two angels and bargained about the fate of Soddom and Gomorrah. (Genesis 18:1-5) That is not what Gen 18 says. The original text is in Hebrew and the word used to describe G-d is made of 4 letters. BTW, who are the sons of G-d mentioned in the same chapter. For Jesus to be the one talking to Abraham, the men (referred as sons of G-d) had to be the children of Jesus. How many childrend did Jesus had? Abraham was able to recognize Jesus immediately as is apparent by his actions of running toward Him, bowing and speaking \"my Lord\". Nah, that is not what happen. Genesis says that HaShem appeared to Abraham and THEN 3 MAN (anashim) showed up. So, who is the one that was already talking to Abraham at the begining of Gen 18? Furthermore, the word used in Gen 18 is adonay, which is used both to refer to G-d and man. The main difference is that Chapter 18 MAKES a difference by using the 4-letter Name and the word adonai. In addition, there were 3 man, not jus one. Abraham had met the Lord before (Genesis 12:7). The word used is AGAIN the 4-letter Name of G-d. Most Christians (that I have talked to) recognize HaShem with the first person of the Trinity. Jesus speaking of God the Father: \"No man hath seen God at any time\" (1 John 4:12) Moses did: Exodus 33:11 And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.\" Deut.34: 10 And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face;\" Since John says that nobody has seen G-d and the two books of the Torah says Moses did. Someone is lying. \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape\" (John 5:37) The whole congregation at Mt. Sinai did: Deut.4:33 Did ever a people hear the voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? So, Abraham had a very real, personal discussion with the person who would later be known as Jesus Christ. There is no scripture in the OT that indicates this event . BY the time Jesus was born, Abraham was already dead. So they never met. Abraham even called Jesus. \"the Judge of all the earth\" (Genesis 18:23-25) No, Jesus is not the Judge of the earth according to Gen 18:25 That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?' Jacob, later known as Israel, Abraham's grandson had an all night wrestling match with Jesus. Is Jesus an Angel too? In reality nobody knows the name of the man/angel that Jacob encountered: Gen 32: 30 And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there. The match went on for some time until the breaking of the day. Both were physically adept and the match was extremely close. Jacob's unkown wrestler touched part of his thigh which put it out of joint, but Jacob kept such an iron grasp that the mystery man asked to be freed. Jacob realized the man's true identity and then the man said \"Let me go, for it is dawn\". Jacob replied \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\" \"What is your name?\" the man asked. \"Jacob\" \"Your name will no longer be Jacob\" the man said. \"It is now Israel, because you have struggled with both God and men, and have won\". When Jacob gave a name to this venue, he named the place \"Peniel\" -\"face of God\" -for he said \"I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared\".

Actually, if that was the case, would'nt Jesus had to be stonned for disrespecting Mary when she came to loook for him? Or is that one of those Torah edicts that you choose to ignore?

I am sure you knew that we don't have a Sanhedrin. Worn any cotton polyester blend lately?? If so let us know when the stoning is....... Ignorance in action again. The prohibition is not against wearing cotton and polyester. Which bible are you reading? The prohibition is against shaatnez (mixture of linen and wool). If you are going to ask questions, the least you can do, is to ask subjects within Torah Law. There are 18 transgressions punishable by stoning:seven consisting of prohibited sexual relations, eight relating to beliefs (i.e. blasphemy like in the case of Jesus), two of disobedience to one's father and mother (the one who curses his father and his mother, the stubborn and rebellious son), and one of profaning the Shabbat. NOWHERE it says that mixture of textiles is punishable by stoning. Don't make things up with the Torah, because you will be fallen in the category of these that add to it. That is not a good thing. And for your information, observant Jews do not mix textiles. We are careful about it. eaten any lobster, shrimp, clams, oysters, or crabs lately, poor you, gonna be a bucket of stones for you!! Lie or ignorance, which one? Observant Jews don't eat any of that. But eating them is not punishable by stoning. Don't lie about the Torah, Jesus would be super mad at you. I mean, that is, if Jesus knew anything about it. Since you just wrote the Tetragrammaton can we come and stone YOU?? Ignorance again. To beging with, you are not a Jew, not part of Israel and not recipient of Torah. So, that disqualifies you for ANYTHIGN dealing with Torah application. So, no you cannot stone nobody. In addition, there is no law about stoning for writing the name of G-d. Scribes write the name of G-d all the time! You know, when they write the Torah Scrolls, the tefilim, mezuzot... After all the penalty for uttering the name, is death by stoning. Really? Where is this written? Remember that if you add to the Torah you are commiting a transgresion. Furthermore, by saying these things you are lying. Your position is delicate, as you are a preacher and a teacher. I would assume that this statements are base on ignorance and nothing more. Just thought I would bring up that pesky \"ignoring statutes we don't agree with any longer\" thing you keep talking about. You certainly failed to do that, and instead you showed either your ignorance, your lies or your attempt to ridicule something you are completely lost about. I mean, saying that wearing cotton and polyester is even mentioned in the Torah is so ridicoulus. So, advice, next time do your research first. Maybe then you would be able to bring some substance to your arguments. Ixcatzin",

I have come to realize that nobody yet that I know of, except for the stories of Jesus in the NT have been able to follow all the laws of the 10 commandments. It's my opinion that when Christ came and clarified those laws, he made it even tougher... You commit adultery by thinking about adultery regardless of your actions. Basically, by your inner intent (includes thoughts) you break the laws, regardless of whether you physically do or not. Whoa, for me that means he made it even tougher... But, it was impossible before... Hmmm What if the purpose of the 10 Commandments, the newer clarifications, and our own understanding is not to follow law @ all... I'm beginning to think (influenced by \"The Shack\") the intent of these laws is more like a reflection for us each to look into and see ourselves as we really are. It gives us a standard to see how far we each individually are moving, and in what direction. I think the NT gives us the freedom we need from the commandments to grow in Spirit and achieve without the anchor of failure from the law... Remember this is strictly my take on this, I do not know much for that matter on any subject. I have learned through my limited studies and experiences that when questions are asked, answers are found. But with every answer, deeper questions appear... I usually don't have the time for all the answers so I need the room to follow my heart. When I do, I find through others that I seem to accomplish things beyond my understanding.

CJ Thank you for your answer, But, Why do xtians feel the need to follow the 10 commandments, These laws were given to Israel, Not the gentile. I am not trying to say do your best to break them because they are good rules to live by, But gentiles (sorry the only way I can think to say this) are not under the laws given to Israel. The only perpose for a gentile to feel the need to follow the 613 laws given to Israel (10 commandments included) is if they are seeking conversion. G-D made a covnant with the gentiles threw Noah there are only 7 of these laws, granted there are laws built around them in some cases to help people NOT break these laws. This covnant is also precious to G-D. I realy tried to understand your response to the question, But, If the 10 commandments were given to Israel NOT to all gentiles, WHY are xtians worried about keeping the laws (10 commandments). I am not trying to be hard headed but I cannot understand your answer. Maybe i need to figure out another way to ask this question. I do get frustrated but not with other people but with my own inability to find the right words for my questions. D.J.",

        "quote": "Originally posted by TAH407: Hi Donnie... I know this is Bruce's question to answer, I am in no way answering for him. I would like to answer your question about the 10 commandments myself... I have come to realize that nobody yet that I know of, except for the stories of Jesus in the NT have been able to follow all the laws of the 10 commandments. It's my opinion that when Christ came and clarified those laws, he made it even tougher... You commit adultery by thinking about adultery regardless of your actions. Basically, by your inner intent (includes thoughts) you break the laws, regardless of whether you physically do or not. Whoa, for me that means he made it even tougher... But, it was impossible before... Hmmm What if the purpose of the 10 Commandments, the newer clarifications, and our own understanding is not to follow law @ all... I'm beginning to think (influenced by \"The Shack\") the intent of these laws is more like a reflection for us each to look into and see ourselves as we really are. It gives us a standard to see how far we each individually are moving, and in what direction. I think the NT gives us the freedom we need from the commandments to grow in Spirit and achieve without the anchor of failure from the law... Remember this is strictly my take on this, I do not know much for that matter on any subject. I have learned through my limited studies and experiences that when questions are asked, answers are found. But with every answer, deeper questions appear... I usually don't have the time for all the answers so I need the room to follow my heart. When I do, I find through others that I seem to accomplish things beyond my understanding. If you believe in G-d, and I believe in G-d we are on the same field regardless of our personal beliefs. We should not allow others to influence that... Thanks for listening, it's good to meet you...

        "reply": " Thank you for your answer, But, Why do xtians feel the need to follow the 10 commandments, These laws were given to Israel, Not the gentile. I am not trying to say do your best to break them because they are good rules to live by, But gentiles (sorry the only way I can think to say this) are not under the laws given to Israel. The only perpose for a gentile to feel the need to follow the 613 laws given to Israel (10 commandments included) is if they are seeking conversion. G-D made a covnant with the gentiles threw Noah there are only 7 of these laws, granted there are laws built around them in some cases to help people NOT break these laws. This covnant is also precious to G-D.

Or: Do Christians find it important to follow Israel's 10 Commandments? If that's your question, Bruce answered best with; \"We need an understanding of the actual 10 to follow the 2 that Christ said would be the most important, In following the 2 we actually are following the 10 as best we can!\" The question of whether we actually can or have ever is another question... Which leads to How do you get to Heaven? Again another question... If your questions intent is actually: Are you trying to claim promises to Israel as your own without following the laws, or converting? The answer is no... We try to follow our bible as we humanly understand it, our promise is from Jesus, our primary job is to accept that love in our hearts, believe in Him, His life, death, resurection, and repent... From there our promises are clearly spelled out by his love for us, which utimately is the will of G-d as we humanly understand it. We generally believe Jesus is G-d in human form, we also believe the Holy Spirit is G-d in Spirit form completing us in that relationship, (I use Tri-unity) the Trinity which is G-d within us, the actual Church of Christ, but limited by our human understandings.

Jesus NEVER said that Gentiles were to be 'grafted' in Israel. That is Paul's teachings(Rom 11:24). Paul is the one with the idea that thanks to Jesus, gentiles were now part of G-d's plan. As if the Nations (before Jesus) were not important to HaShem!! Few people know anything about the 7 Laws of Noah and how precious they are to HaShem. Very few seem to understand that the first Covenant given by G-d, was with the Nations! Imagine that!! G-d has always loved the Nations!

The scripture indicates that the Lord - Jesus, not God the Father appeared in the form of man before Abraham with two angels and bargained about the fate of Soddom and Gomorrah. (Genesis 18:1-5) Abraham was able to recognize Jesus immediately as is apparent by his actions of running toward Him, bowing and speaking \"my Lord\". Abraham had met the Lord before (Genesis 12:7) Jesus speaking of God the Father: \"No man hath seen God at any time\" (1 John 4:12) \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape\" (John 5:37) So, Abraham had a very real, personal discussion with the person who would later be known as Jesus Christ. Abraham even called Jesus. \"the Judge of all the earth\" (Genesis 18:23-25) Jacob, later known as Israel, Abraham's grandson had an all night wrestling match with Jesus. The match went on for some time until the breaking of the day. Both were physically adept and the match was extremely close. Jacob's unkown wrestler touched part of his thigh which put it out of joint, but Jacob kept such an iron grasp that the mystery man asked to be freed. Jacob realized the man's true identity and then the man said \"Let me go, for it is dawn\". Jacob replied \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\" \"What is your name?\" the man asked. \"Jacob\" \"Your name will no longer be Jacob\" the man said. \"It is now Israel, because you have struggled with both God and men, and have won\".

The Old Testament is not about some grouchy, old \"God the father\", it's about Jesus. The term \"angel\", is found when Jesus appeared to Moses for the first time: \"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" He said to Moses: \"I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob\". (Exodus 3:2,6) While the God of the Old Testament said \"I AM\" would be His name forever, Jesus was nearly stoned to death by the Jews for calling Himself \"I AM\". God was seen and heard many times in the Old Testament, who was it everyone in the Old Testament saw and heard? Jesus is the same God who ordered light to shine from the very beginning, the same God who flooded the earth, the same God who used His finger to write the Ten Commandments into the stone tablets.

The scripture indicates that the Lord - Jesus, not God the Father appeared in the form of man before Abraham with two angels and bargained about the fate of Soddom and Gomorrah. (Genesis 18:1-5) That is not what Gen 18 says. The original text is in Hebrew and the word used to describe G-d is made of 4 letters. BTW, who are the sons of G-d mentioned in the same chapter. For Jesus to be the one talking to Abraham, the men (referred as sons of G-d) had to be the children of Jesus. How many childrend did Jesus had? Abraham was able to recognize Jesus immediately as is apparent by his actions of running toward Him, bowing and speaking \"my Lord\". Nah, that is not what happen. Genesis says that HaShem appeared to Abraham and THEN 3 MAN (anashim) showed up. So, who is the one that was already talking to Abraham at the begining of Gen 18? Furthermore, the word used in Gen 18 is adonay, which is used both to refer to G-d and man. The main difference is that Chapter 18 MAKES a difference by using the 4-letter Name and the word adonai. In addition, there were 3 man, not jus one. Abraham had met the Lord before (Genesis 12:7). The word used is AGAIN the 4-letter Name of G-d. Most Christians (that I have talked to) recognize HaShem with the first person of the Trinity. Jesus speaking of God the Father: \"No man hath seen God at any time\" (1 John 4:12) Moses did: Exodus 33:11 And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.\" Deut.34: 10 And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face;\" Since John says that nobody has seen G-d and the two books of the Torah says Moses did. Someone is lying. \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape\" (John 5:37) The whole congregation at Mt. Sinai did: Deut.4:33 Did ever a people hear the voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? So, Abraham had a very real, personal discussion with the person who would later be known as Jesus Christ. There is no scripture in the OT that indicates this event . BY the time Jesus was born, Abraham was already dead. So they never met. Abraham even called Jesus. \"the Judge of all the earth\" (Genesis 18:23-25) No, Jesus is not the Judge of the earth according to Gen 18:25 That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?' Jacob, later known as Israel, Abraham's grandson had an all night wrestling match with Jesus. Is Jesus an Angel too? In reality nobody knows the name of the man/angel that Jacob encountered: Gen 32: 30 And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there. The match went on for some time until the breaking of the day. Both were physically adept and the match was extremely close. Jacob's unkown wrestler touched part of his thigh which put it out of joint, but Jacob kept such an iron grasp that the mystery man asked to be freed.

When Jacob gave a name to this venue, he named the place \"Peniel\" -\"face of God\" -for he said \"I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared\". Why did you skip the part where Jacob asked the name of the man? You know why the name of the man is not important? Because he is only an Angel, nothing else. The Old Testament is not about some grouchy, old \"God the father\", it's about Jesus. You mean the Christian OT? The Jewish Tanakh is all about the Torah of HaShem, Israel and the Nations. The term \"angel\", is found when Jesus appeared to Moses for the first time: \"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" He said to Moses: \"I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob\". (Exodus 3:2,6) An angel is MALACH. If Jesus is an Angel, then Jesus is a created being. Angels are not gods. Here, read the original text: \u05d1 \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0 \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5, \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05ea-\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1--\u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05da\u05b0 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4; \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05e0\u05bc\u05b5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4, \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e0\u05b6\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc. While the God of the Old Testament said \"I AM\" would be His name forever, Jesus was nearly stoned to death by the Jews for calling Himself \"I AM\". Yeah, in Judaism that is blasphemy. Since Jesus was a Jew according to the Torah, he had to be stoned. God was seen and heard many times in the Old Testament, who was it everyone in the Old Testament saw and heard? Not according to 1 John 4:12 and John 5:37, as you preciously pointed-out. Jesus is the same God who ordered light to shine from the very beginning, the same God who flooded the earth, the same God who used His finger to write the Ten Commandments into the stone tablets. No really. Unless you are talking about a different creation, commandments, etc. that are Christian in nature. In that case you may be right. So, let me ask you something, is there a Trinity? When Jesus talks about the Father, is he talking about himself? Is he his own father? This information really makes the Bible even more powerful for me. It completely bridges the meanings of the laws and proves the Bible maintains the consistent message it promises. Which laws? Could you explain them to us? It enlightens me to how our God operates and helps me understand the role of Jesus (although adds many questions) and shows even more that He was not merely a \"sacrifice\" (as many atheists like to say \"how could He murder his Son\") but an integral part neccessary for our understanding, because let's face it, we were created with great minds and it is an abomination to not attempt to understand the complexities of our Father. Who is the father, because according to Christian Theology Jesus is the Son. So where is the Bible is the Father mentioned? Ixcatzin This message has been edited.

Here, read the original text: \u05d1 \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0 \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5, \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05ea-\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1--\u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05da\u05b0 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4; \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05e0\u05bc\u05b5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4, \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e0\u05b6\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc. While the God of the Old Testament said \"I AM\" would be His name forever, Jesus was nearly stoned to death by the Jews for calling Himself \"I AM\". Yeah, in Judaism that is blasphemy. Since Jesus was a Jew according to the Torah, he had to be stoned. God was seen and heard many times in the Old Testament, who was it everyone in the Old Testament saw and heard? Not according to 1 John 4:12 and John 5:37, as you preciously pointed-out. Jesus is the same God who ordered light to shine from the very beginning, the same God who flooded the earth, the same God who used His finger to write the Ten Commandments into the stone tablets. No really. Unless you are talking about a different creation, commandments, etc. that are Christian in nature. In that case you may be right. So, let me ask you something, is there a Trinity? When Jesus talks about the Father, is he talking about himself? Is he his own father? This information really makes the Bible even more powerful for me. It completely bridges the meanings of the laws and proves the Bible maintains the consistent message it promises. Which laws? Could you explain them to us? It enlightens me to how our God operates and helps me understand the role of Jesus (although adds many questions) and shows even more that He was not merely a \"sacrifice\" (as many atheists like to say \"how could He murder his Son\") but an integral part neccessary for our understanding, because let's face it, we were created with great minds and it is an abomination to not attempt to understand the complexities of our Father. Who is the father, because according to Christian Theology Jesus is the Son. So where is the Bible is the Father mentioned?",

        "content": "quote: Originally posted by ixcatzin: quote: Originally posted by soscorpio: \"God the Father\" is not in the Torah. Because the concept of the Trinity is Christian and the Torah is Jewish. The scripture indicates that the Lord - Jesus, not God the Father appeared in the form of man before Abraham with two angels and bargained about the fate of Soddom and Gomorrah. (Genesis 18:1-5) That is not what Gen 18 says. The original text is in Hebrew and the word used to describe G-d is made of 4 letters. BTW, who are the sons of G-d mentioned in the same chapter. For Jesus to be the one talking to Abraham, the men (referred as sons of G-d) had to be the children of Jesus. How many childrend did Jesus had? Abraham was able to recognize Jesus immediately as is apparent by his actions of running toward Him, bowing and speaking \"my Lord\". Nah, that is not what happen. Genesis says that HaShem appeared to Abraham and THEN 3 MAN (anashim) showed up. So, who is the one that was already talking to Abraham at the begining of Gen 18? Furthermore, the word used in Gen 18 is adonay, which is used both to refer to G-d and man. The main difference is that Chapter 18 MAKES a difference by using the 4-letter Name and the word adonai. In addition, there were 3 man, not jus one. Abraham had met the Lord before (Genesis 12:7). The word used is AGAIN the 4-letter Name of G-d. Most Christians (that I have talked to) recognize HaShem with the first person of the Trinity. Jesus speaking of God the Father: \"No man hath seen God at any time\" (1 John 4:12) Moses did: Exodus 33:11 And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.\" Deut.34: 10 And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face;\" Since John says that nobody has seen G-d and the two books of the Torah says Moses did. Someone is lying. \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape\" (John 5:37) The whole congregation at Mt. Sinai did: Deut.4:33 Did ever a people hear the voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? So, Abraham had a very real, personal discussion with the person who would later be known as Jesus Christ. There is no scripture in the OT that indicates this event . BY the time Jesus was born, Abraham was already dead. So they never met. Abraham even called Jesus. \"the Judge of all the earth\" (Genesis 18:23-25) No, Jesus is not the Judge of the earth according to Gen 18:25 That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?' Jacob, later known as Israel, Abraham's grandson had an all night wrestling match with Jesus. Is Jesus an Angel too? In reality nobody knows the name of the man/angel that Jacob encountered: Gen 32: 30 And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there. The match went on for some time until the breaking of the day. Both were physically adept and the match was extremely close. Jacob's unkown wrestler touched part of his thigh which put it out of joint, but Jacob kept such an iron grasp that the mystery man asked to be freed. Jacob realized the man's true identity and then the man said \"Let me go, for it is dawn\". Jacob replied \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\" \"What is your name?\" the man asked. \"Jacob\" \"Your name will no longer be Jacob\" the man said. \"It is now Israel, because you have struggled with both God and men, and have won\". When Jacob gave a name to this venue, he named the place \"Peniel\" -\"face of God\" -for he said \"I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared\". Why did you skip the part where Jacob asked the name of the man? You know why the name of the man is not important? Because he is only an Angel, nothing else. The Old Testament is not about some grouchy, old \"God the father\", it's about Jesus. You mean the Christian OT? The Jewish Tanakh is all about the Torah of HaShem, Israel and the Nations. The term \"angel\", is found when Jesus appeared to Moses for the first time: \"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" He said to Moses: \"I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob\".

Actually, if that was the case, would'nt Jesus had to be stonned for disrespecting Mary when she came to loook for him? Or is that one of those Torah edicts that you choose to ignore? This statement shows your ignorance regarding basic Halakha. Let me help you here, in order for an edict to take place (judgment) there has to be a Sanhedrin to judge. I am sure you knew that we don't have a Sanhedrin. Worn any cotton polyester blend lately?? If so let us know when the stoning is....... Ignorance in action again. The prohibition is not against wearing cotton and polyester. Which bible are you reading? The prohibition is against shaatnez (mixture of linen and wool). If you are going to ask questions, the least you can do, is to ask subjects within Torah Law. There are 18 transgressions punishable by stoning:seven consisting of prohibited sexual relations, eight relating to beliefs (i.e. blasphemy like in the case of Jesus), two of disobedience to one's father and mother (the one who curses his father and his mother, the stubborn and rebellious son), and one of profaning the Shabbat. NOWHERE it says that mixture of textiles is punishable by stoning. Don't make things up with the Torah, because you will be fallen in the category of these that add to it. That is not a good thing. And for your information, observant Jews do not mix textiles. We are careful about it. eaten any lobster, shrimp, clams, oysters, or crabs lately, poor you, gonna be a bucket of stones for you!! Lie or ignorance, which one? Observant Jews don't eat any of that. But eating them is not punishable by stoning. Don't lie about the Torah, Jesus would be super mad at you. I mean, that is, if Jesus knew anything about it. Since you just wrote the Tetragrammaton can we come and stone YOU?? Ignorance again. To beging with, you are not a Jew, not part of Israel and not recipient of Torah. So, that disqualifies you for ANYTHIGN dealing with Torah application. So, no you cannot stone nobody. In addition, there is no law about stoning for writing the name of G-d. Scribes write the name of G-d all the time! You know, when they write the Torah Scrolls, the tefilim, mezuzot... After all the penalty for uttering the name, is death by stoning. Really? Where is this written? Remember that if you add to the Torah you are commiting a transgresion. Furthermore, by saying these things you are lying. Your position is delicate, as you are a preacher and a teacher. I would assume that this statements are base on ignorance and nothing more. Just thought I would bring up that pesky \"ignoring statutes we don't agree with any longer\" thing you keep talking about. You certainly failed to do that, and instead you showed either your ignorance, your lies or your attempt to ridicule something you are completely lost about. I mean, saying that wearing cotton and polyester is even mentioned in the Torah is so ridicoulus. So, advice, next time do your research first. Maybe then you would be able to bring some substance to your arguments. Ixcatzin",

I have come to realize that nobody yet that I know of, except for the stories of Jesus in the NT have been able to follow all the laws of the 10 commandments. It's my opinion that when Christ came and clarified those laws, he made it even tougher... You commit adultery by thinking about adultery regardless of your actions. Basically, by your inner intent (includes thoughts) you break the laws, regardless of whether you physically do or not. Whoa, for me that means he made it even tougher... But, it was impossible before... Hmmm What if the purpose of the 10 Commandments, the newer clarifications, and our own understanding is not to follow law @ all... I'm beginning to think (influenced by \"The Shack\") the intent of these laws is more like a reflection for us each to look into and see ourselves as we really are. It gives us a standard to see how far we each individually are moving, and in what direction. I think the NT gives us the freedom we need from the commandments to grow in Spirit and achieve without the anchor of failure from the law... Remember this is strictly my take on this, I do not know much for that matter on any subject. I have learned through my limited studies and experiences that when questions are asked, answers are found. But with every answer, deeper questions appear...

CJ Thank you for your answer, But, Why do xtians feel the need to follow the 10 commandments, These laws were given to Israel, Not the gentile. I am not trying to say do your best to break them because they are good rules to live by, But gentiles (sorry the only way I can think to say this) are not under the laws given to Israel. The only perpose for a gentile to feel the need to follow the 613 laws given to Israel (10 commandments included) is if they are seeking conversion. G-D made a covnant with the gentiles threw Noah there are only 7 of these laws, granted there are laws built around them in some cases to help people NOT break these laws. This covnant is also precious to G-D. I realy tried to understand your response to the question, But, If the 10 commandments were given to Israel NOT to all gentiles, WHY are xtians worried about keeping the laws (10 commandments). I am not trying to be hard headed but I cannot understand your answer. Maybe i need to figure out another way to ask this question. I do get frustrated but not with other people but with my own inability to find the right words for my questions. D.J.",

Basically, by your inner intent (includes thoughts) you break the laws, regardless of whether you physically do or not. Whoa, for me that means he made it even tougher... But, it was impossible before... Hmmm What if the purpose of the 10 Commandments, the newer clarifications, and our own understanding is not to follow law @ all... I'm beginning to think (influenced by \"The Shack\") the intent of these laws is more like a reflection for us each to look into and see ourselves as we really are. It gives us a standard to see how far we each individually are moving, and in what direction. I think the NT gives us the freedom we need from the commandments to grow in Spirit and achieve without the anchor of failure from the law... Remember this is strictly my take on this, I do not know much for that matter on any subject. I have learned through my limited studies and experiences that when questions are asked, answers are found. But with every answer, deeper questions appear... I usually don't have the time for all the answers so I need the room to follow my heart. When I do, I find through others that I seem to accomplish things beyond my understanding. If you believe in G-d, and I believe in G-d we are on the same field regardless of our personal beliefs. We should not allow others to influence that... Thanks for listening, it's good to meet you...

        "reply": " Thank you for your answer, But, Why do xtians feel the need to follow the 10 commandments, These laws were given to Israel, Not the gentile. I am not trying to say do your best to break them because they are good rules to live by, But gentiles (sorry the only way I can think to say this) are not under the laws given to Israel. The only perpose for a gentile to feel the need to follow the 613 laws given to Israel (10 commandments included) is if they are seeking conversion. G-D made a covnant with the gentiles threw Noah there are only 7 of these laws, granted there are laws built around them in some cases to help people NOT break these laws. This covnant is also precious to G-D. I realy tried to understand your response to the question, But, If the 10 commandments were given to Israel NOT to all gentiles, WHY are xtians worried about keeping the laws (10 commandments). I am not trying to be hard headed but I cannot understand your answer. Maybe i need to figure out another way to ask this question. I do get frustrated but not with other people but with my own inability to find the right words for my questions. D.J.",

I'm paraphrasing what I understand your question to be: Why do Christians find it important to try and follow the 10 Commandments when they were actually given to Israel?... Or: Do Christians find it important to follow Israel's 10 Commandments? If that's your question, Bruce answered best with; \"We need an understanding of the actual 10 to follow the 2 that Christ said would be the most important, In following the 2 we actually are following the 10 as best we can!\" The question of whether we actually can or have ever is another question... Which leads to How do you get to Heaven? Again another question... If your questions intent is actually: Are you trying to claim promises to Israel as your own without following the laws, or converting? The answer is no... We try to follow our bible as we humanly understand it, our promise is from Jesus, our primary job is to accept that love in our hearts, believe in Him, His life, death, resurection, and repent... From there our promises are clearly spelled out by his love for us, which utimately is the will of G-d as we humanly understand it. We generally believe Jesus is G-d in human form, we also believe the Holy Spirit is G-d in Spirit form completing us in that relationship, (I use Tri-unity) the Trinity which is G-d within us, the actual Church of Christ, but limited by our human understandings.

Jesus NEVER said that Gentiles were to be 'grafted' in Israel. That is Paul's teachings(Rom 11:24). Paul is the one with the idea that thanks to Jesus, gentiles were now part of G-d's plan. As if the Nations (before Jesus) were not important to HaShem!! Few people know anything about the 7 Laws of Noah and how precious they are to HaShem. Very few seem to understand that the first Covenant given by G-d, was with the Nations! Imagine that!! G-d has always loved the Nations!
