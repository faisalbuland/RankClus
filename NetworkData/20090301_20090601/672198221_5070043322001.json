The world knew about the waterboarding long before President Obama was elected. It is not true that interrogation techniques - interrogation methods that professional interrogators insist are EFFECTIVE in getting information from even hard-core al Qaeda are still available for use. It is true that the government no longer hires contractors to torture people. As the FBI agent testified before Congress, al-Qaeda members are trained to be prepared for the type of torture they would get if they were captured in Saudi Arabia or Egypt \u2013 even the Bush Administration did not go that far. So they are well prepared for anything that American torturers can dish out. It is a false argument that the memos provided information that helps the enemy to prepare for what might happen if they are captured by American forces. Contrary to what Rush or Hannity told you, the memos do not describe the torture methods used by CIA contractors. What they cannot prepare for is being outsmarted by a professional interrogator who will not even threaten physical torture. But this is not a is torture legal or effective or neccessary thread. Cheney claims that since waterboarding and other torture techniques are no longer used, America is less safe. The question is \u2013 how can one reach the conclusion that because no one is being tortured right now, American is less safe from attack?",

Who does he want the Obama Administration to torture to make us safer? CIA Director Hayden, under the Bush Administration, testified before Congress in February 2008 that \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d had not been used since 2003. So what Cheney is saying is that since President Obama no longer allows the tactics that the Bush has NOT used since 2003, that the country is less safe. It does not make sense, but the bushies cling to whatever Dick says, even if it makes no sense. By the way, the Obama Administration is continuing the surveillance of communications within the United States, they are just following the law and using the FISA Court for oversight, AS REQUIRED BY LAW, is the only difference. So when Cheney says \u201cwhen you get rid of enhanced interrogation techniques, for example, or the terrorist surveillance program, you reduce the intelligence flow to the intelligence community\u201d THAT IS A LIE. Hes arguing to keep the option on the table. I know that must be hard for you to understand.",

It is a false argument that the memos provided information that helps the enemy to prepare for what might happen if they are captured by American forces.

What they cannot prepare for is being outsmarted by a professional interrogator who will not even threaten physical torture. But this is not a is torture legal or effective or neccessary thread. Cheney claims that since waterboarding and other torture techniques are no longer used, America is less safe.

The point is that by announcing to the world that we will not used enhanced interrogation techniques Mr. Obama has weakened the U.S.A. in several ways. He has told the world we have been committing crimes against prisoners whether that is true or not. He is telling terrorists and allies who mistake compassion for weakness that we will not even use the minimal techniques we have used in the past in order to obtain information that might save American lives he ties our intelligence operatives hands behind their backs by preventing them from using such techniques to obtain vital information from any terrorist captured in the future regardless of what information he might have. These techniques were not used willy-nilly against every prisoner we had in custody. They were only used in very specific cases under strict medical supervision when there was tangible evidence that a particular terrorist held information that was harmful to innocent citizens. President Obama did not tell the world that crimes had been committed against prisoners, the Bush Administration did. Dick Cheney has admitted that he approved waterboarding, CIA Director Hayden admitted in testimony to Congress that prisoners have been waterboarded and President Bush himself admitted in May 2008 that waterboarding has been used on prisoners. The world knew about the waterboarding long before President Obama was elected. It is not true that interrogation techniques - interrogation methods that professional interrogators insist are EFFECTIVE in getting information from even hard-core al Qaeda are still available for use. It is true that the government no longer hires contractors to torture people. As the FBI agent testified before Congress, al-Qaeda members are trained to be prepared for the type of torture they would get if they were captured in Saudi Arabia or Egypt \u2013 even the Bush Administration did not go that far. So they are well prepared for anything that American torturers can dish out. It is a false argument that the memos provided information that helps the enemy to prepare for what might happen if they are captured by American forces. Contrary to what Rush or Hannity told you, the memos do not describe the torture methods used by CIA contractors. What they cannot prepare for is being outsmarted by a professional interrogator who will not even threaten physical torture. But this is not a is torture legal or effective or neccessary thread. Cheney claims that since waterboarding and other torture techniques are no longer used, America is less safe. The question is \u2013 how can one reach the conclusion that because no one is being tortured right now, American is less safe from attack?",
