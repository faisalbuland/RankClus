That's sweeping leaves on a windy day. - I'll grant you that in the absense of the law, prosecution and incarceration, \"desparate\" people will do desparate things. Those pirates, we are told, are teens, if not high on substances, then high on \"visions of grandure\", pirate adventure and over-inflated ego (no, no links, just my own imagination).

I have to wonder how many of those lethally armed \"kids\" are assulting ships to provide for their kids and how many are doing it for \"pleasure and treasure\". They may say \"gimme yore moneyand I'll go away\" but if you resist, they've demonstrated their willingness to f'n kill you. In my lexicon, racism is harboring irrational beliefs about an entire race of humans (you know, the white, black, brown, yellow, purple thing). I'm sure there is an appropriate word for irrational, disparaging attitudes towards some nation...like France...or Nam...or K, etc. Of course one cannot hope to stop crime but one can reduce the numbers of those perpetrating it...even if it's one at a time, as we have seen. Besides, I have a hard time lumping these acts of piracy into any catagory of crime I see comitted. Basically, it's acts of war committed against soverign nations...punishable by death.",
