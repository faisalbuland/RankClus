You take the guns away, the law abiding citizens lose that power, thus losing their rights and eventually their freedoms. Whats next after the second admendment is taken away, the first admendment.

I was at a gunshow yesterday, and frankly, many of the weapons I saw for sale made me shake my head: M-2 .50 Cal Machine guns! Yes, if you have the right permit, you can buy a fully functional one. About four different varieties of .50 Cal Sniper Rifles - great for hunting rabbits and coyotes I guess. And no permit of any kind require for those babies - guaranteed to shoot 5 inch groups at 2000 yards! Super - or stupid - - I was walking through this gigantic show, which covered an area larger than a football field, with my son who is a Policeman. We just shook our heads at all the weird guns people were snatching up, and the huge lines at the Ammo Concession, where people were panic-buying hundreds of pounds of bullets . .. What was even more scary was that I saw groups speaking spanish, russian, and several other languages buying up all kinds of guns - spooky... My feeling were definitely mixed. I'm a gun owner, but I didn't buy anything. Neither did my son - though we both looked at several handguns. As we left, I kinda wondered if any of those people would some day aim one of those at my boy - chilling. . . When I dropped him off at his house, my last words were, \"Make sure you always wear your vest to work...\" \"I always do,\" he said..... I agree GW...... there are a slew of weapons available that never should be... a man needs a shotgun or two, a rifle he can hunt with, a .22 for plinking and maybe a varminter for the long range challenge.. oh, and a handgun. But then there be a bunch of \"Rambo's\" and gangsta's running around... One Flag......One Heart......One Nation............EVERMORE",

We have plenty of laws on the books right now restricting gun ownership, which applies to felons and misdemeanors. Enforce the ones on the books already. The end line is that some in our government are just down right afraid of law abiding citizens having rights and the power to challenge them if the day ever comes. You take the guns away, the law abiding citizens lose that power, thus losing their rights and eventually their freedoms. Whats next after the second admendment is taken away, the first admendment. You can try and paint it another way, but the truth here is black and white, we have enemies within, they are called Socialists and Communists and they are trying to take over our nation.",
