That is because there is nothing short of invading that country that will prevent a nut like Kim Jong Il, who is willing to starve his people, from showing off his missile. From a fox news story, October 10, 2006 \u201cThe announcement comes after U.S. responded Monday to North Korea's claim that it had successful detonated a nuclear weapon by circulating a tough draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council condemning the nuclear test and impose wide-ranging sanctions on the country for disregarding the world body's admonishments to not move forward with the test. A copy of the Security Council document obtained by The Associated Press says that the United States wants the resolution to fall under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals explicitly with threats to international peace and security, as well as acts of aggression. Chapter 7 grants the council the authority to impose a range of measures that include breaking diplomatic ties and imposing economic and military sanctions to taking military action. The resolution would enact tough restrictions, including a trade ban on military and luxury items, the power to inspect all cargo entering or leaving the country, and freezing assets connected with its weapons programs. The draft also adds new proposals from Japan that would ban all countries from allowing any North Korean ships in their ports or any North Korean aircraft from taking off or landing in their territory and impose travel restrictions on high-ranking North Korean officials.\u201d Bolton echoed the stern warning delivered earlier in the day by President Bush, who called North Korea's nuclear test \"unacceptable\" and \"provocative,\" and warned the regime of Kim Jong Il that the U.S. would honor its commitments to protect its Asian allies \"The United States will meet the full range of our deterrent and security commitments,\" Bush said during a brief White House appearance. President Bush called the transfer of nuclear weapons or material would constitute \"a grave threat to the United States, and we hold North Korea fully accountable for the consequences of such actions.\" \"Threats will not lead to a brighter future for the North Korean people,\" Bush said.",

Then they threatened a second one and he promised Aid if the didnt. Thats submitting to blackmail. cut of diplomatic relations boycott them and Dump the whole thing in the UNs lap and take a back seat.

That is because there is nothing short of invading that country that will prevent a nut like Kim Jong Il, who is willing to starve his people, from showing off his missile. From a fox news story, October 10, 2006 \u201cThe announcement comes after U.S. responded Monday to North Korea's claim that it had successful detonated a nuclear weapon by circulating a tough draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council condemning the nuclear test and impose wide-ranging sanctions on the country for disregarding the world body's admonishments to not move forward with the test. A copy of the Security Council document obtained by The Associated Press says that the United States wants the resolution to fall under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals explicitly with threats to international peace and security, as well as acts of aggression. Chapter 7 grants the council the authority to impose a range of measures that include breaking diplomatic ties and imposing economic and military sanctions to taking military action. The resolution would enact tough restrictions, including a trade ban on military and luxury items, the power to inspect all cargo entering or leaving the country, and freezing assets connected with its weapons programs. The draft also adds new proposals from Japan that would ban all countries from allowing any North Korean ships in their ports or any North Korean aircraft from taking off or landing in their territory and impose travel restrictions on high-ranking North Korean officials.\u201d Bolton echoed the stern warning delivered earlier in the day by President Bush, who called North Korea's nuclear test \"unacceptable\" and \"provocative,\" and warned the regime of Kim Jong Il that the U.S. would honor its commitments to protect its Asian allies \"The United States will meet the full range of our deterrent and security commitments,\" Bush said during a brief White House appearance. President Bush called the transfer of nuclear weapons or material would constitute \"a grave threat to the United States, and we hold North Korea fully accountable for the consequences of such actions.\" \"Threats will not lead to a brighter future for the North Korean people,\" Bush said.",
