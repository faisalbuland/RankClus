I went a couple of years ago, and they got me squared away with some recommendations, some Simvastatin, and some fish oil pills. A couple of months ago, a developed body aches and discontinued my statin. I'm back in the group, trying Pravastatin this time. Anybody here have any experience with this drug? I'm particularly concerned because my family history is full of muscle-cramp problems. I have cramps at night, mostly, and wind up jumping from bed. ...It scares the dickens out of my wife.",

One trick I learned is to sleep with the leg which is more prone to cramping elevated which doesn't make sense from a circulatory standpoint but it works. Other trick is to not have anything that you can push against in your sleep to aggravate the cramps. Ask your Doc if you can take your meds in the morning or at noon. Good luck",

Problem is... at sixty three, things are changing anyway. I exercise quite regularly, but the aches seem to come at me differently than they did ten years ago. They feel different. Muscle aches just aren't the same thing, anymore. Much cramping comes from compressed nerves and other back related stuff so it's hard to discern the cause, sometimes. I studied up on Co Q10 after someone suggested it, and from the studies it appears to be a wives tale. I don't like to take stuff unless it's been used by millions for a few years, just to see how many of them have adverse reactions. I used to be prescribed quinine for leg cramps, but they don't do that anymore; carcinogenic or something.",
