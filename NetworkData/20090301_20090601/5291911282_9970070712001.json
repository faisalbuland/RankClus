Old dreams seem to take on a life of their own, we can confuse the original symbols with subsequent thoughts we unavoidably have of them.

The meaning of archtypes is debated among the various schools (some are pretty hilarious others sound like they come from some demented/perverted brain). Btw, being naked in public is another archtype. lol. Ultimately only the individual can begin to be accurate about what his dream symbols mean...that's where a dream journal comes in. I have one of those micro-cassett recorders by my bed. Easier to talk, ah, mumble, to a recorder while making a pizz call than writing in a tablet.",

The particular timing of this topic coming up, and some of you sharing your dreams, is the only reason I am discussing any of this. I hope this is not a mistake I make.

Old dreams seem to take on a life of their own, we can confuse the original symbols with subsequent thoughts we unavoidably have of them.
