Instead I foolishly said the first thing that popped in my head; \"So, what do you want me to do about it?\"* Three weeks later, I finally finished installing the new floor, floor molding, toilet, cabinet, sink, mirror, medicine cabinet, and painting the room four times, twice in the color she didn't realize she hated until it dried, and twice more in a color she could live with (in an ominously dangerous voice) \"for now.\" I realize there may be some young unmarried or newly married men out there who missed the obvious errors in my reply, so I ennumerate them for you now: Error #1. I replied. The proper response should have been feigned deafness, a noncommital grunt of some kind or silence accompanied by a rapid exit to the far side of the house and immediate start of the disposal, lawn mower, chainsaw, motorcycle, skillsaw or jet engine to render any further communication impossible. Error #2. I did not immediately contradict her, meaning I silently (and therefore emphatically) agreed to the unsatisfactoriness of the current (free) wallpaper,.... vanity, flooring, cabinets, mirror, lights, floorboards,... you get the picture. Error #3. I announced the immediate availability of my effort, time, money and expertise with an open-ended schedule and limitless budget....AND demanded that she set the priority, starting time and work hours for the entire project.

        "reply": "This is because the communication between man and wife is a wild mix of hidden meanings, muttered cryptic intonations and veiled enigmatic phrases that can interpreted in a myriad of ways ranging from the Illiad in original Greek to 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.' As Churchill would say, they (the Soviets or women, take your pick) are \"An enigma, wrapped in a riddle, shrouded in mystery.\" For example, a recent $1000 upgrade of our master bathroom started like this: My wife walked into our bathroom and stated innocently (right!): \"I hate this wallpaper\" After 26 years I should have seen it coming. Instead I foolishly said the first thing that popped in my head; \"So, what do you want me to do about it?\"* Three weeks later, I finally finished installing the new floor, floor molding, toilet, cabinet, sink, mirror, medicine cabinet, and painting the room four times, twice in the color she didn't realize she hated until it dried, and twice more in a color she could live with (in an ominously dangerous voice) \"for now.\" I realize there may be some young unmarried or newly married men out there who missed the obvious errors in my reply, so I ennumerate them for you now: Error #1. I replied. The proper response should have been feigned deafness, a noncommital grunt of some kind or silence accompanied by a rapid exit to the far side of the house and immediate start of the disposal, lawn mower, chainsaw, motorcycle, skillsaw or jet engine to render any further communication impossible. Error #2. I did not immediately contradict her, meaning I silently (and therefore emphatically) agreed to the unsatisfactoriness of the current (free) wallpaper,.... vanity, flooring, cabinets, mirror, lights, floorboards,... you get the picture. Error #3. I announced the immediate availability of my effort, time, money and expertise with an open-ended schedule and limitless budget....AND demanded that she set the priority, starting time and work hours for the entire project. I include this only as a guide for new and/or future husbands in order that they may formulate the proper reply to such statements. Here endeth the lesson. Sullivan013",
