        "content": "military jury has acquitted an Illinois Marine sergeant on charges of murdering an unarmed detainee during battle in Fallujah, Iraq. The jury of eight Marines who served in Iraq or Afghanistan also acquitted Sgt. Ryan Weemer on Thursday of dereliction of duty in the November 2004 death. Weemer could have faced a maximum sentence of life in prison and dishonorable discharge if convicted of murder. The maximum sentence for dereliction is six months in prison and a bad conduct discharge. The defense argued during closing arguments that the 26-year-old Weemer acted in self-defense. A prosecutor recounted that Weemer said in recorded interviews that he shot the man and told a squadmate that he would have to live with that for the rest of his life. http://www.military.com/news/article/April-2009/marine-...in-iraq-slaying.html This message has been edited.

Hopefully it works out for him and he stays in, but I won't blame him if he gets out.
