By 1969 I had already served one tour in Europe, one tour in Vietnam, one tour in Korea and was in the middle of my second Vietnam tour. I remember hearing on AFRVietnam that Neil Armstrong had just walked on the moon. I remember looking up at the moon and thinking I hope he can remember how to get back! I don't believe that we would have been any better off than we are now if the Governments had not wasted our tax dollars. Where ever there are politicians then you know that our money is being wasted. The only wat to get ahead is to have term limits.",
