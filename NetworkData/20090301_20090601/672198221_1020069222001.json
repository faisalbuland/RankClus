Judd Gregg is co-sponsoring a plan to help military families when they have to move to another state because of new deployment. The bill would allow military spouses to maintain residency in one state when their family gets orders to move to another. Currently, military men and women can maintain residency in their home state, regardless of where military orders send them. However, their spouses do not have the same benefit, meaning that with every move, they must update drivers' licenses, file tax returns in multiple states and change vehicle and voter registrations. Gregg says the law also makes it less likely that deeds and titles of family property would be in the spouse's name.",
