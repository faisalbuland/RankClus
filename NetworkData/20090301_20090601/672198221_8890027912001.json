Non-lethal weapons are defined as \u201cweapons, devices and munitions that are explicitly designed and primarily employed to incapacitate targeted personnel or materiel immediately, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel and un-desired damage to property in the target area or environment. Non-lethal weapons are intended to have reversible effects on personnel and materiel.\u201d The Navy and Marine Corps have bought Acoustic Hailing Devices to be used on ships, at checkpoints and mounted atop vehicles. The device demonstrated at Quantico can broadcast recorded sounds and tones at high decibel levels to warn individuals that they are approaching a restricted area or are coming too close to vehicles or vessels. \u201cIt is an addition to the escalation of force,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. Lance Lantier, the education and experimentation officer of the JNLWD. \u201cIt is not meant to replace lethal weapons, but is used as a warning. It keeps us from having to pull the trigger as a first response.\u201d During the demonstration, the AHD was tested from 100, 200 and 300 meters away. The device was successful in relaying audible intelligible messages from those ranges. This hailing and warning device helps service members determine the intent of someone at long distances and helps eliminate the possibility of sudden attacks and miscommunication. more here: http://www.military.com/news/article/marine-corps-news/...an-hear-you-now.html \"A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.\" ~ Gerald Ford",
