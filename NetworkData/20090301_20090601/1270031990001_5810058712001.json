        "content": "Robert Burns was said to be a Godly man. And his poem, \"Holy Willie's Prayer\" or sometimes \"Epitaph on Holy Willie,\" is often said to be not the work of a genius toiling at the reality of God but a condemnation of one Willie Fisher in his church who was a hypocrite. Indeed, after its publication, hypocrites were called Holy Willie. Honestly, as an atheist, the first stanza tells it all, for me. But, the first stanza was meant as a something that Willie Fisher would have said: that you can't get to heaven by good works, only by slavishly believing in God. Many artists in days gone by had to give a nod to God if they wanted to stay in business... indeed, many think they still have to. I'm not saying that Burns was one of them, but in Burns you don't appear to see the work of a thoroughly \"godly\" person. I picture an earthy old Scotsman repeating it when I read it; great image, for me; I hope it works that way in all it's rolled 'r's and tweeds for you, too. Here it is. Maybe you can tell the affinities of the author from it: Holy Willie's Prayer O Thou, that in the heavens does dwell, As it pleases best Thysel', Sends aen to Heaven an' ten to Hell, For Thy glory, And no for ony gude or ill They've done afore Thee! I bless and praise Thy matchless might, When thousands Thou hast left in night, That I am here afore Thy sight, For gifts an' grace A burning and a shining light To a' this place. What was I, or my generation, That I should get sic exaltation? I wha deserv'd most just damnation For broken laws, Six thousand years 'ere my creation, Thro' Adam's cause. When from my mither's womb I fell, Thou might hae plung'd me deep in hell, To gnash my gooms, and weep and wail, In burnin lakes, Where damned devils roar and yell, Chain'd to their stakes. Yet I am here a chosen sample, To show thy grace is great and ample; I'm here a pillar o' Thy temple, Strong as a rock, A guide, a buckler, and example, To a' Thy flock. O Lord, Thou kens what zeal I bear, When drinkers drink, an' swearers swear, An' singing here, an' dancin there, Wi' great and sma'; For I am keepit by Thy fear Free frae them a'. But yet, O Lord! confess I must, At times I'm fash'd wi' fleshly lust: An' sometimes, too, in worldly trust, Vile self gets in; But Thou remembers we are dust, Defil'd wi' sin. O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wi' Meg Thy pardon I sincerely beg; O may't ne'er be a livin' plague To my dishonour, An' I'll ne'er lift a lawless leg Again upon her. Besides, I farther maun avow, Wi' Leezie's lass, three times I trow - But Lord, that Friday I was fou, When I cam near her; Or else, Thou kens, Thy servant true Wad never steer her. Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn Buffet Thy servant e'en and morn, Lest he owre proud and high shou'd turn, That he's sae gifted: If sae, Thy han' maun e'en be borne, Until Thou lift it. Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place, For here Thou has a chosen race! But God confound there stuborn face, An' blast their name, Wha brings Thy elders to disgrace An' open shame. Lord, mind Gaw'n Hamilton's deserts; He drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes, Yet has sae mony takin arts, Wi' great an' sma', Frae God's ain priest the people's hearts He steals awa'. And when we chasten'd him therefore, Thou kens how he bred sic a splore, And set the world in a roar O' laughing at us; Curse Thou his basket and his store, Kail an' potatoes. Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r, Against that Presbyt'ry o' Ayr; Thy strong right hand, Lord mak it bare Upo' their heads; Lord visit them, an' dinna spare, For their misdeeds. O Lord my God! that glib-tongu'd Aitken, My vera heart an' flesh are quakin, To think how we stood sweatin, shakin, An' pish'd wi' dread, While he, wi' hingin lip an' snakin, Held up his head. Lord, in Thy day o' vengeance try him, Lord, visit them wha did employ him, And pass not in Thy mercy by them, Nor hear their pray'r, But for Thy people's sake destroy them, An' dinna spare. But, Lord, remember me an' mine Wi' mercies temporal and divine, That I for grace an' gear may shine, Excell'd by nane, And a' the glory shall be Thine, Amen, Amen!",
