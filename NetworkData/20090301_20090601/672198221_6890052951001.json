The VA dropped me to 10%. Over the next 18-20 years I fought them on that issue. It wasn't untill my Wife Filed a complaint with the VA saying that she was afraid of me, That they started taking a closer look. It took her leaving for me to realize That I needed help and also realized Just how much she was actually doing for me. I Finally went to The hospital and demanded an evaluation.I can only thank god that we were able to address this before I hurt her physically. The emotional damage was bad enough on her. Luckily she came back after finding out I was in counceling and heavily medicated.Shortly after that I was increased to 10% physical service connected and 60% phycological (panic / anger / Depression)Service connected. About a year or so later They finally gave me what they call 80% overall service connected.Since then The pain has gotten so bad that I have to either use a walker or wheel chair and take 70mg.of morphine and several other drugs just to tolerate the pain which has moved into my spine. Obviousely Unemployable (if not intolerable at times) I'm still at 80%. My wife has had to quit working to help me, If thats not bad enough They say that unless I die from my service connected disability she will be on her own. How is that fair to her? She has no healthcare or income of her own. You would think that if they are willing to pay someone to come out and take care of my daily needs, Why not pay her for doing it?Lets not forget the night attacks that have landed me in the ER on several occasions. If it wasn't for my wife I would have probably died years ago if not from My chronic ilness then from getting all or some of my medications mixed up. Do you realize how closely morphine looks like clonazapam (Klonipin).The Veterans administration needs to WAKE up and realize that is the Veteran's Spouses That actually do all the work, and not a visiting nurse.They just put a $20,000 ramp system on my house but they refuse to give a penny to the person that pushes me up that huge and extremely long ramp.I am 5'8\" and 215lbs she is 4'11\" 120lbs,Just thinking about how hard she works is enough to depress anyone. Now she is having vision problems and has no way to get help. They say she will be blind in 10 - 15 years. Social services says we have too much income and The VA doesn't care. How is that fair to the person that has been doing the work of a VA employee for 14 years without even getting a thank you from them. All the family caregivers need to get together and collectively give the government A huge kick in the seat of their pants. As a Disabled Veteran I would like to THANK ALL THE FAMILLY CAREGIVERS FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ! I did recieve an email from Hillery Clinton before she was reassigned to a new possition by the president,stating that this was a project she was addressing.",

I've certainly not received any money for the years that I took care of my late husband. I'm still fighting them for DIC which I will probably not get. So...here I am with only Social Security as an income and with what the DOW has done to my small savings I will be on the street before long. This is certainly not what my husband and I had planned for our retirement years nor would he be happy to know the situation I am now in. The VA could not possibly care or something would have been done long ago. All caregivers should receive some type of compensation to make up for what they had to give up to care for their disabled spouses. It's too late now for me to start a career, build a 401K, have paid health insurance, and all the other benefits that I lost to take care of my wonderful husband and I would do it again without hesitation but now that he is gone, just what are we supppose to do to support ourselves? Did you know that if you are working and injured on the job that workers comp will pay your spouse if you need a caregiver? Why does the VA not do this?",

As a Disabled Veteran I would like to THANK ALL THE FAMILLY CAREGIVERS FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ! I did recieve an email from Hillery Clinton before she was reassigned to a new possition by the president,stating that this was a project she was addressing.[/QUOTE I don't understand, if you are at 80% with 60% of that being PTSD connected....and you are \"unemployable\".....why aren't you going for an \"unemployability\" rating? With that added rating you would equal 100% !! When part of your rating is PTSD related, you do not have to meet all the criteria for a 100% disability rating, to equal 100%. The term \"unemployable\" added to your rating equals 100%. If you are rated a total of 100%, then you ask to be rated \"total & perm\". With that rating your wife is eligible for educational benefits, she is eligible for CHAMPVA, a wonderful medical benefit that assures her she will never pay more than $3,000.00 per year for necessary medical care. She would get maintenance meds for free. If you get that rating and apply for life insurance within a year with the VA, you can get $10,000.00 worth of free life insurance. You could be eligible for tax relief from your state...... For your wife to receive 100% compensation, you would either have to die from a service connected illness, or be 100% disabled for 10 yrs. before you die from any cause. At 100% all of your medical, dental, optical expenses would be covered. As a wife of a disabled vet, I would like to thank you for your service. I would also like to encourage you to get the assistance of a free representative. The VietNam Veterans of America, The Disabled Veterans....there are many organizations that offer free assistance for VA claims. The VA has many services and ways to help, but people need to know where and how to seek what they should be receiving. You must appeal a rating within 1 year of that rating, or you would lose any back pay for your claim. It would be considered a new claim. I would also like to suggest that your wife read a book that has helped quite a few people I know....Recovering From the War by Patience Mason. It helps to explain what PTSD is and how it affects the family. Your wife (and you) will learn that your behaviors are not her fault. It helps to understand how war affects our men and the families. It helps to understand that PTSD is a survival instinct. Good luck, Kris",
